        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020.\n\n# **Market volatility expected to continue in the week ahead with Presidential debate and jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/market-volatility-expected-to-continue-in-the-week-ahead-with-presidential-debate-and-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market volatility, with sharp ups, downs and reversals, is likely to be the norm again in the week ahead, as investors await Friday\u2019s jobs report and watch headlines from Washington and the presidential debate.\n*****\n&gt; Expectations remain low for a stimulus package from Congress, but as economists downgrade their view of fourth quarter growth because of a lack of further federal virus aid, investors are again looking for some guidance from Washington. The election is likely to be a market focus in the week ahead, as the first presidential debate takes place between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden Tuesday night.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were very volatile in the past week, but the S&amp;P 500 was down less than 1% for the week by Friday afternoon. For the month of September, it is down about 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing now a typical September, but under the hood we\u2019re seeing what is potentially a rotation from the large tech stocks to a broader pool of stocks,\u201d said Don Townswick, director of equities strategy for Conning. He expects tech to remain a favorite after the shakeout, and the market tone could change in October if earnings results are good and company outlooks are positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that tends to turn things around,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the much anticipated September employment report, the last before the election, to show a slower pace of job growth than in August. The consensus forecast is for 920,000 nonfarm payrolls, from 1.37 million in August, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 8.2% from 8.4%. JP Morgan economists said they expect job growth to continue, but they also said the lack of stimulus and aid to the unemployed could slow consumer spending. They reduced their forecast for fourth quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 3.5% Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # Election watch\nMichael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said the debate may have more potential to move the market than the jobs report. \u201cMost people talk about these things and get all fired up and nothing happens, but this is such a weird year... This seems like the first big shot to see these guy in action. We think it\u2019s a big event,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said if Trump is perceived to win, and his chances rise in prediction markets by several points, there could be a positive move in risk markets and the bond market could sell off, sending yields higher. Trump is perceived as better for stocks and the economy, and Biden is expected to push for higher taxes and more regulation, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think that pushes the 10-year yield up to 75 or 80 basis points,\u201d he said. The 10-year has been locked in a range below 0.70% and was at 0.65% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf Biden wins, then the debate is risk off. Then Trump\u2019s chances of winning probably go to 40%, maybe lower. Then the 10-year yield goes to 0.60%,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The market was also expected to be volatile in the coming week because of month-end and quarter-end rebalancing, but Schumacher said the stock market sell-off has taken some of the pressure off of the need to realign portfolios and he expects about $9 billion to move into bonds for rebalancing.\n*****\n&gt; Before the earnings period starts in the second week of October, the market is likely to continue to focus on what\u2019s worrying it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we have... is a lot of uncertainty related to the election, a lot of uncertainty related to stimulus,\u201d said Townswick. He does not expect the political back and forth over the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to impact the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut the stimulus and election, people can say that\u2019s going to directly relate to earnings,\u201d he said. Townswick said the sell-off so far is not unusual for September, historically the worst month of the year.\n*****\n&gt; Among S&amp;P 500 companies, Townswick said 70% left their forecasts unchanged or revised them higher after second quarter earnings reports, while 30% reduced them. \u201cIf third quarter earnings come in relatively strong, then we could see more revisions upward and that would tend to support the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Many strategists expect the S&amp;P 500 could decline all the way to its 200-day moving average which was 3,107 on Friday. The 200-day is a widely watched momentum indicator, based on the average of the closing prices in the last 200 sessions. If the index falls below it and stays there, it\u2019s viewed as negative for the market but it often acts as support.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t have a target, but I think if that does happen, I would say that is a normal pullback and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to break through and tank. I would say that might be supportive,\u201d Townswick said.\n*****\n&gt; The coming week is busy in terms of economic data. Besides the jobs report, there is ISM and PMI manufacturing data Thursday. Personal income and spending data is also released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; But it is the employment data, the market is watching most closely.\n*****\n&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the weekly jobless claims data is sending a positive signal for the jobs report, but not all data matches it. The number of unemployed who have come off of state and special pandemic benefits totaled 2 million over the period between mid August and mid September, when the government collected data for Friday\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said he will not be so much focused on the non farm payrolls as on the number of people who say their job loss is now permanent. That number rose by 534,000 last month, to a total of 3. million. It was at 1.2 million in February\n*****\n&gt; Initially when job losses mounted, many individuals expected their job loss was temporary.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe permanent job loss is an indication of an amount of permanent scarring that\u2019s going on in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe permanent job loss as a share of unemployment has been more rapid than the previous recessions.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wb4gd2A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N9GB7pr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/F7N4lcy.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/9XvRbwLZ/econcal4.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vxohRfN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uFKJWI5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Og1iuMy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9A4Jc0z.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/zBTB51gf/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/h4rD0s8N/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/zXGJ2h0v/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/sxw3DfD3/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Bears Strike Again\n\n&gt; The September weakness continued with the S&amp;P 500 Index 9.6% off the all-time high set on September 2 (as of 9/23/20). It is important to remember that after a 60% rally in the S&amp;P 500\u2014and much more in some of the large cap tech stocks\u2014this type of seasonal weakness is normal and expected. We noted in our blog Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year that some type of seasonal weakness could be in the cards.\n\n&gt; Speaking of seasonal weakness, the second half of September historically has been one of the worst periods of the year for stocks, as shown in our chart below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another angle on this is showing how each day of the year does. Again, we are in the sweet spot for potential rocky seas.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cTo see some late-September weakness after a record 60% rally shouldn\u2019t be too surprising,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhat might surprise some investors, though, is that after some of the previous best six-month rallies ever, in a lot of cases, the strength continued going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recent rally was one of the best six-month rallies ever for the S&amp;P 500. Looking at all the previous rallies that gained at least 30%, returns are somewhat muted near term. But going out a full year, prices have typically moved higher, up seven out of eight times a year later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 October Gains Frequently Precede Presidential Incumbent Party Victories\n\n&gt; An interesting aspect of election-year Octobers is the propensity for S&amp;P 500 gains when the incumbent party ultimately retains the White House. Of the ten incumbent victories since 1944, the S&amp;P 500 has advanced seven times, declined twice, and was unchanged in 1944 with an average October gain of 1.4%. Of the nine occurrences since 1944 when the incumbent was defeated, there were six S&amp;P 500 declines and three advances in October. The average October decline when incumbents were defeated was 2.1%. Even excluding the S&amp;P\u2019s 16.9% plunge in 2008, incumbent defeats were still preceded by an average October loss of 0.3%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cbcf92c83edf8fa419f858f97753f5b3/fc62a1e0362941f1-92/s400x600/14f363a1beca3d2f879a2228394f91ff339b2a37.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Low Energy\" Energy\n\n&gt; US stocks are looking to close out the week on a positive note with the S&amp;P 500 up over 1%. One sector that hasn't been participating in the rally, however, is Energy. While it just moved back into positive territory for the day, the sector remains at the back of the pack in terms of sector performance. If these levels hold for the remainder of the trading day, it will be the 69th time in the last 200 trading days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector. That works out to more than once every three trading days. Talk about a sector that's in liquidation mode!\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the rolling 200-day total number of days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500. While the current level of 69 is extremely high, earlier this month the rolling 200-day total was even higher at 71. Over this same period of time, no other sector has even seen close to as many days of ranking at the bottom as Energy. The next closest is Utilities as it has been at the bottom of the pack in terms of performance on 36 of the last 200 trading days. It hasn't just been the last 200 trading days that have been rough for the Energy sector. Over the last five years, the sector has been the worst-performing sector on just over 23% of all trading days. Is this what it felt like for the horse and buggy companies in the early 1900s or the ice-harvesting companies after the invention of electric refrigeration?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/092520-Energy.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Real-Time Data Charts To Track the Recovery\n\n&gt; We check in again today on some of the real-time economic data that LPL Research is monitoring to provide timely and valuable insights into the state of the US economy. Traditional economic data is often reported too slowly to pick up the changes that are occurring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n&gt; The latest data on US COVID-19 cases has shown steady progress since peaking at the end of July. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since the end of June and are close to the lows of mid-June. The number of positive COVID cases rose over the last week, and while the number of tests performed increased, the positive test rate also increased to near 6% (source: COVID Tracking Project). Further, Labor Day get-togethers may have created the recent bump in transmission, a trend we saw following other holidays over the summer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cEven as much of the real-time data shows a slowing recovery as Americans adjust to the new normal, it\u2019s encouraging that new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates have improved greatly since mid-summer,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cProgress on a COVID-19 vaccine and fiscal stimulus could help the economy and markets in the fourth quarter, but as investors struggle with election uncertainty and US-China tensions remain elevated, it\u2019s likely to be a bumpy ride.\u201d\n\n&gt; Out of all the indicators we monitor, US retail sales had been showing one of the most robust recoveries toward the end of the summer as it exceeded 2019 levels on a year-over-year basis, but the most recent weekly readings from retailers on same-store sales recently slipped back lower than last year (source: Bloomberg, Johnson Redbook). It\u2019s not surprising that consumer confidence levels, as measured by the Bloomberg Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, also dipped on their last reading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Driving map routing requests by the Apple maps app exceeded pre-pandemic levels but have since leveled off and is now declining slightly. This real-time indicator steadily recovered from March and April lows as people returned to work or other economic activity, and it\u2019s been continuing at a higher than normal rate as Americans travel by car when they previously may have used public transit or air travel. Public transit usage, as measured by Moovit, is still at only 50% of its baseline level, as working from home has a huge effect on usage numbers in major metropolitan areas.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-6.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Electricity demand is also showing a bumpy recovery. It had recovered, dipped, and then recovered, only to dip again since the start of September. Demand for electricity dropping again potentially indicates a slowdown in the rate at which businesses are reopening or softening demand for their goods and services.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; During the midst of the March lockdowns, the number of diners in US restaurants hit extreme lows of -100% compared to the same time last year. The last reading on this indicator was -45%, coming off a recent peak of -30% on September 7 (source: Opentable). Restaurant bookings could be under pressure as cooler weather makes outdoor dining less comfortable in parts of the country.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As the seasons change from summer to fall, consumer behavior often changes, too, and the potential for heightened rates of viral transmission grows. We will continue to monitor key high-frequency data and provide updates for clues about the path of the economic recovery as we continue to battle the outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/9QGXxg0h/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hryCCMm.pngg))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ymR5Z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.29.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ER6w385.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/p2YCpFn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b7i1AYQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1N7dKUo.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XL4b2EY.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.2.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $49.14\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "After cashing in on MU calls this morning, like the rest of us, I immediately noticed a sharp drop in tech stocks, which made me reconsider the future of the VIX, which has trended up more than 20% since Aug 18, even as the SPY continues to reach new highs.\n\nOur friend [Mohamed El-Erian](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447) credits the the decoupling of the of the VIX from the SPY largely on due to retail investors continuing to chase the parabolic climb in tech stocks with as many calls as they can, assuming the ride will never end. The last time this happened (think Sept '19 - Feb '20), the VIX eventually hit a new ATH and SPY fell 32%. I don't see this happening again at all, at least in the short term, especially if the recession turns into a depression and a longer term low forms below the bottom reached on March 23, 2020. \n\nWhile premiums are high on VXX and UVXY, they should imply that the market is anticipating an increase in volatilty leading up to the election, or for reasons yet to be understood. In my opinion, the SPY is being bought up even more intraday to counter the affects of rising volatility. Keep in mind that the increase in volatility is occuring alongside the continuous actions of the Fed. The last thing we should do is fight the Fed, but how long can this massive disconnect from reality continue?",

The filing covers the sale of the software company's common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and units.\n\nUnless otherwise provided in a prospectus supplement, the company plans to use net proceeds from the sale of securities for general corporate purposes. This is important to note moving forward that the company has the ability to tap in to this when need be.  \nCleanSpark experienced a market pull-back after reaching ATH\u2019s earlier this year at $16.00. Currently trading pre-market at $12/share. CLSK also recently announced they won a contract with the U.S embassy in Africa for the next five years.

(Nasdaq: TRVN), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel medicines for patients with central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced three presentations at the virtual 2020 American College of Clinical Pharmacology (ACCP) Annual Meeting, taking place from September 21 st to 23rd, 2020. \n\nThe Company gave a live presentation on TRV027, its AT1 receptor selective agonist being studied as a potential treatment for ARDS / abnormal clotting in COVID-19. Additionally, the Company will present two posters highlighting previously published data for OLINVYK, which is approved in the  U.S.  for the management of acute pain, and TRV250, its delta receptor selective agonist being developed for the acute treatment of migraine.\n\n\u201cI am pleased at this opportunity to present compelling data from three of our programs. The interest from ACCP highlights the diversity of our novel pipeline, with multiple exciting catalysts over the next few months,\u201d said  Mark A. Demitrack , M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of  Trevena, Inc.\n\nAbout TRV250\n\nTRV250 is a G-protein selective agonist targeting the delta receptor, with potential to be a first-in-class, non-narcotic mechanism for the treatment of migraine. TRV250 also may have utility in a range of other central nervous system indications. As a selective delta receptor modulator, TRV250 is not expected to have the abuse and addiction liability of medications targeting the mu opioid receptor. TRV250 is an investigational product and has not been approved by FDA for distribution in the US.\n\n About TRV027\n\nTRV027 is a novel AT1 receptor selective agonist that has previously been studied in 691 individuals. It has demonstrated efficacy, potency, and selectivity at the AT1 receptor in nonclinical studies and has a well-characterized pharmacokinetic profile. In previous clinical trials, there was a low dropout rate associated with TRV027, and no significant safety issues were reported. In  April 2020 , the Company filed a provisional patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office covering the use of TRV027 to treat ARDS and the prevention or treatment of abnormal clotting in COVID-19 patients.\n\nAbout OLINVYK\u2122 (oliceridine) injection\n\nOLINVYK is a new chemical entity approved by the FDA in  August 2020 . It is indicated in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate. OLINVYK will not be available for distribution until the  United States Drug Enforcement Administration  assigns it to its schedule of controlled substances. Please see Important Safety Information, including the BOXED WARNING, and full prescribing information at [www.OLINVYK.com](http://www.olinvyk.com/).  \nTrevena has a number of product candidates they are working on, and more importantly they are keeping their shareholders in the loop. Shares soared on news of FDA approval back in early August for OLINVYK, before falling to the low $1.50\u2019s during the recent market pullback. Trevena has a price target of $5 with a \u201cbuy\u201d indication from Guggenheim.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020.\n\n# **Market volatility expected to continue in the week ahead with Presidential debate and jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/market-volatility-expected-to-continue-in-the-week-ahead-with-presidential-debate-and-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market volatility, with sharp ups, downs and reversals, is likely to be the norm again in the week ahead, as investors await Friday\u2019s jobs report and watch headlines from Washington and the presidential debate.\n*****\n&gt; Expectations remain low for a stimulus package from Congress, but as economists downgrade their view of fourth quarter growth because of a lack of further federal virus aid, investors are again looking for some guidance from Washington. The election is likely to be a market focus in the week ahead, as the first presidential debate takes place between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden Tuesday night.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were very volatile in the past week, but the S&amp;P 500 was down less than 1% for the week by Friday afternoon. For the month of September, it is down about 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing now a typical September, but under the hood we\u2019re seeing what is potentially a rotation from the large tech stocks to a broader pool of stocks,\u201d said Don Townswick, director of equities strategy for Conning. He expects tech to remain a favorite after the shakeout, and the market tone could change in October if earnings results are good and company outlooks are positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that tends to turn things around,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the much anticipated September employment report, the last before the election, to show a slower pace of job growth than in August. The consensus forecast is for 920,000 nonfarm payrolls, from 1.37 million in August, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 8.2% from 8.4%. JP Morgan economists said they expect job growth to continue, but they also said the lack of stimulus and aid to the unemployed could slow consumer spending. They reduced their forecast for fourth quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 3.5% Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # Election watch\nMichael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said the debate may have more potential to move the market than the jobs report. \u201cMost people talk about these things and get all fired up and nothing happens, but this is such a weird year... This seems like the first big shot to see these guy in action. We think it\u2019s a big event,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said if Trump is perceived to win, and his chances rise in prediction markets by several points, there could be a positive move in risk markets and the bond market could sell off, sending yields higher. Trump is perceived as better for stocks and the economy, and Biden is expected to push for higher taxes and more regulation, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think that pushes the 10-year yield up to 75 or 80 basis points,\u201d he said. The 10-year has been locked in a range below 0.70% and was at 0.65% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf Biden wins, then the debate is risk off. Then Trump\u2019s chances of winning probably go to 40%, maybe lower. Then the 10-year yield goes to 0.60%,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The market was also expected to be volatile in the coming week because of month-end and quarter-end rebalancing, but Schumacher said the stock market sell-off has taken some of the pressure off of the need to realign portfolios and he expects about $9 billion to move into bonds for rebalancing.\n*****\n&gt; Before the earnings period starts in the second week of October, the market is likely to continue to focus on what\u2019s worrying it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we have... is a lot of uncertainty related to the election, a lot of uncertainty related to stimulus,\u201d said Townswick. He does not expect the political back and forth over the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to impact the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut the stimulus and election, people can say that\u2019s going to directly relate to earnings,\u201d he said. Townswick said the sell-off so far is not unusual for September, historically the worst month of the year.\n*****\n&gt; Among S&amp;P 500 companies, Townswick said 70% left their forecasts unchanged or revised them higher after second quarter earnings reports, while 30% reduced them. \u201cIf third quarter earnings come in relatively strong, then we could see more revisions upward and that would tend to support the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Many strategists expect the S&amp;P 500 could decline all the way to its 200-day moving average which was 3,107 on Friday. The 200-day is a widely watched momentum indicator, based on the average of the closing prices in the last 200 sessions. If the index falls below it and stays there, it\u2019s viewed as negative for the market but it often acts as support.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t have a target, but I think if that does happen, I would say that is a normal pullback and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to break through and tank. I would say that might be supportive,\u201d Townswick said.\n*****\n&gt; The coming week is busy in terms of economic data. Besides the jobs report, there is ISM and PMI manufacturing data Thursday. Personal income and spending data is also released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; But it is the employment data, the market is watching most closely.\n*****\n&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the weekly jobless claims data is sending a positive signal for the jobs report, but not all data matches it. The number of unemployed who have come off of state and special pandemic benefits totaled 2 million over the period between mid August and mid September, when the government collected data for Friday\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said he will not be so much focused on the non farm payrolls as on the number of people who say their job loss is now permanent. That number rose by 534,000 last month, to a total of 3. million. It was at 1.2 million in February\n*****\n&gt; Initially when job losses mounted, many individuals expected their job loss was temporary.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe permanent job loss is an indication of an amount of permanent scarring that\u2019s going on in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe permanent job loss as a share of unemployment has been more rapid than the previous recessions.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wb4gd2A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N9GB7pr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/F7N4lcy.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/9XvRbwLZ/econcal4.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vxohRfN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uFKJWI5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Og1iuMy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9A4Jc0z.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/zBTB51gf/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/h4rD0s8N/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/zXGJ2h0v/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/sxw3DfD3/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Bears Strike Again\n\n&gt; The September weakness continued with the S&amp;P 500 Index 9.6% off the all-time high set on September 2 (as of 9/23/20). It is important to remember that after a 60% rally in the S&amp;P 500\u2014and much more in some of the large cap tech stocks\u2014this type of seasonal weakness is normal and expected. We noted in our blog Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year that some type of seasonal weakness could be in the cards.\n\n&gt; Speaking of seasonal weakness, the second half of September historically has been one of the worst periods of the year for stocks, as shown in our chart below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another angle on this is showing how each day of the year does. Again, we are in the sweet spot for potential rocky seas.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cTo see some late-September weakness after a record 60% rally shouldn\u2019t be too surprising,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhat might surprise some investors, though, is that after some of the previous best six-month rallies ever, in a lot of cases, the strength continued going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recent rally was one of the best six-month rallies ever for the S&amp;P 500. Looking at all the previous rallies that gained at least 30%, returns are somewhat muted near term. But going out a full year, prices have typically moved higher, up seven out of eight times a year later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 October Gains Frequently Precede Presidential Incumbent Party Victories\n\n&gt; An interesting aspect of election-year Octobers is the propensity for S&amp;P 500 gains when the incumbent party ultimately retains the White House. Of the ten incumbent victories since 1944, the S&amp;P 500 has advanced seven times, declined twice, and was unchanged in 1944 with an average October gain of 1.4%. Of the nine occurrences since 1944 when the incumbent was defeated, there were six S&amp;P 500 declines and three advances in October. The average October decline when incumbents were defeated was 2.1%. Even excluding the S&amp;P\u2019s 16.9% plunge in 2008, incumbent defeats were still preceded by an average October loss of 0.3%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cbcf92c83edf8fa419f858f97753f5b3/fc62a1e0362941f1-92/s400x600/14f363a1beca3d2f879a2228394f91ff339b2a37.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Low Energy\" Energy\n\n&gt; US stocks are looking to close out the week on a positive note with the S&amp;P 500 up over 1%. One sector that hasn't been participating in the rally, however, is Energy. While it just moved back into positive territory for the day, the sector remains at the back of the pack in terms of sector performance. If these levels hold for the remainder of the trading day, it will be the 69th time in the last 200 trading days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector. That works out to more than once every three trading days. Talk about a sector that's in liquidation mode!\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the rolling 200-day total number of days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500. While the current level of 69 is extremely high, earlier this month the rolling 200-day total was even higher at 71. Over this same period of time, no other sector has even seen close to as many days of ranking at the bottom as Energy. The next closest is Utilities as it has been at the bottom of the pack in terms of performance on 36 of the last 200 trading days. It hasn't just been the last 200 trading days that have been rough for the Energy sector. Over the last five years, the sector has been the worst-performing sector on just over 23% of all trading days. Is this what it felt like for the horse and buggy companies in the early 1900s or the ice-harvesting companies after the invention of electric refrigeration?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/092520-Energy.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Real-Time Data Charts To Track the Recovery\n\n&gt; We check in again today on some of the real-time economic data that LPL Research is monitoring to provide timely and valuable insights into the state of the US economy. Traditional economic data is often reported too slowly to pick up the changes that are occurring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n&gt; The latest data on US COVID-19 cases has shown steady progress since peaking at the end of July. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since the end of June and are close to the lows of mid-June. The number of positive COVID cases rose over the last week, and while the number of tests performed increased, the positive test rate also increased to near 6% (source: COVID Tracking Project). Further, Labor Day get-togethers may have created the recent bump in transmission, a trend we saw following other holidays over the summer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cEven as much of the real-time data shows a slowing recovery as Americans adjust to the new normal, it\u2019s encouraging that new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates have improved greatly since mid-summer,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cProgress on a COVID-19 vaccine and fiscal stimulus could help the economy and markets in the fourth quarter, but as investors struggle with election uncertainty and US-China tensions remain elevated, it\u2019s likely to be a bumpy ride.\u201d\n\n&gt; Out of all the indicators we monitor, US retail sales had been showing one of the most robust recoveries toward the end of the summer as it exceeded 2019 levels on a year-over-year basis, but the most recent weekly readings from retailers on same-store sales recently slipped back lower than last year (source: Bloomberg, Johnson Redbook). It\u2019s not surprising that consumer confidence levels, as measured by the Bloomberg Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, also dipped on their last reading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Driving map routing requests by the Apple maps app exceeded pre-pandemic levels but have since leveled off and is now declining slightly. This real-time indicator steadily recovered from March and April lows as people returned to work or other economic activity, and it\u2019s been continuing at a higher than normal rate as Americans travel by car when they previously may have used public transit or air travel. Public transit usage, as measured by Moovit, is still at only 50% of its baseline level, as working from home has a huge effect on usage numbers in major metropolitan areas.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-6.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Electricity demand is also showing a bumpy recovery. It had recovered, dipped, and then recovered, only to dip again since the start of September. Demand for electricity dropping again potentially indicates a slowdown in the rate at which businesses are reopening or softening demand for their goods and services.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; During the midst of the March lockdowns, the number of diners in US restaurants hit extreme lows of -100% compared to the same time last year. The last reading on this indicator was -45%, coming off a recent peak of -30% on September 7 (source: Opentable). Restaurant bookings could be under pressure as cooler weather makes outdoor dining less comfortable in parts of the country.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As the seasons change from summer to fall, consumer behavior often changes, too, and the potential for heightened rates of viral transmission grows.

        "selftext": "What's up people of stocks, some of you may have seen my unusual options activity posts in other option's trading sub-reddits. I've decided to put together a little summary for the week that details some trending tickers, option activity, and some setups for next week ( + reasoning for the setup). Mods if this isn't allowed, I won't post again. Here we go:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Upcoming Earnings\n\nMicron (MU) Earnings are coming up this week. The semi-conductor company has been consistently beating earnings and has seen some growth throughout the pandemic as more companies become increasingly tech-focused with work-from-home orders. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their most recent earnings and performance moves day-after the report. \n\n[https://imgur.com/stDsUEx](https://imgur.com/stDsUEx)\n\n**What to look for**\n\nBy proxy, companies that will see some related movements to MU\u2019s earnings are: AMD, INTC, and NVDA. A good showing from MU will also mean good things for other semi-conductor companies.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at MU\u2019s average options\u2019 Implied Volatility (IV) over the last month. We can see that typical IV is in the 40-45% range. When the stock price dropped early September during the crash, we saw IV get up to the 60\u2019s. IV has begun to dip back into the 40\u2019s meaning there is not a huge move expected off the earnings report. (Stock price is gold vs IV blue line). \n\n[https://imgur.com/87nthwQ](https://imgur.com/87nthwQ)\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nWe have some important economic data coming out this week. Here\u2019s the outlook:\n\nTuesday 10am: Consumer Confidence\n\nWednesday 8:30am: GDP Q2, Pending Home Sales\n\nThursday 8:30am: Jobless claims\n\nFriday 8:30am: Unemployment Rate\n\n**Full Calendar of Important Events w/ Forecasts (via Bloomberg):** \n\n[https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC](https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC)\n\n# Trending Stocks\n\nMost Mentioned Tickers + Sentiment from Friday \n\n[https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO](https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO)\n\n# This week\u2019s trend gainers and losers\n\n**Losing Hype:** TSLA, VALE, NKLA, MSFT, WMT, AAPL\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB](https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB)\n\n**Gaining Hype:** BA, VXX, ZM, AAL, UPS, PTON, MU\n\n[https://imgur.com/hpakS2h](https://imgur.com/hpakS2h)\n\n\\*AAPL was losing hype on the weekly trend, but up on the daily trend Thursday &amp; Friday from a good performance.  \n\n# Consolidating Tickers\n\nThese tickers are ones that have once been a \u201cmeme\u201d, but have since settled down, and perhaps a good entry point if your technicals are right, it aligns with your strategy, and want to avoid FOMO-ing into hot stocks. \n\n[https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a](https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a)\n\n# The classic tale of doing the inverse of WSB\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at VALE, a stock that was almost never mentioned a single time in the last month on r/WallStreetBets until September 18th. At that point, the stock had risen 10% in the week before and VALE was then seen all over the comment section of the sub. Comment volume for VALE jumped to 10% of total comment volume on the sub-reddit at which point many WSB members initiated positions. Within the next several trading days the stock tanked 15% leaving WSB holding the bag (yet again). For more details on this, please read \u201cHow not to FOMO into trades\u201d. \n\n[https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B](https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B)\n\n**Swaggy DD (due diligence) released this week - GME (Gamestop)** \n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\nWhen I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see comments like these, yet here we are. What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wallstreetbets thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week.\n\nIts no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\nJust to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically spiked.\n\n[Click here to continue reading the DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/)\n\n# Swaggy Play &amp; Trade Idea - JPM\n\nWhat's up everyone, market has been choppy as FK and almost un-tradeable the last several weeks. Still, not much has changed fundamentally over the last 3-4 weeks and here we are with a 10-20% haircut on stocks depending which tickers you follow. I've been sitting on my hands for a while, but entered a trade today. Keep in mind this is not advice on what or how to trade, simply posting my trade here and if you want to discuss some opinions, lets do it.\n\nWhy JPM? It has been in a fairly tight channel over the last 3-4 months, staying in the range of $90-100. I entered this exact play back in July when the stock dropped to similar levels to where it is currently at right now, and closed at max profit back then. \n\n[Check out the full play details (reasoning + risks)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/izmt2r/swaggyplay_trade_idea_jpm/)\n\n# Unusual Option Activity\n\nSome big volume in option flow was spotted this week in some names: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, and WRTC.\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nADBE saw a massive call block come through on Friday. 5,000 January 2021 CALLs at the $420 strike (10% ITM). Total position size was $40 million. ADBE was about 10-15% off the recent highs and has bounced multiple times off the $470 level. IF this sell-off is truly over, we might see a good bounce in tech and some of these block purchases seem to be positioning for it. \n\n[Read Full Post: Weekly Option Flow Summary, Week of Sept 20-2020: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, WRTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j0rev4/unusual_option_flow_summary_for_the_week_aapl/)\n\n**What\u2019s on the watchlist this week**\n\nStill looking for a bounce in tech. Here are some stocks I either like and have a position or I\u2019m looking for entry points on (stock price + Implied Volatility charts)\n\n**AAPL - Apple**  \n\nAAPL is currently near a short-term low. Does it have room to go down more? Sure, but I think when you dig below the current levels you will be finding more buyers as we get closer to $100. IMO a good entry point for a long-term hold. IV is also moderately high for options. They are set to report earnings by end of October and also have catalyst of rumored 5g iPhone release.\n\n**AMD - Advanced Micro Devices**  \n\nAMD has shown some strength at the $78 level of support through these last few weeks of downside pressure. AMD also reports towards the end of October, but will have some volatility into MU (Micron Technology) earnings next week. IV is pretty high right now for AMD to buy calls. A more efficient play might be to sell CSP (cash-secured put), credit PUT spreads, or purchase shares.\n\n**DOCU - Docusign**  \n\nA second-wave covid-play I\u2019m looking at is DOCU. DOCU just reported earnings that weren\u2019t accepted well by Wall Street. The stock has dropped nearly 30% since it\u2019s peak of $290 not long ago. You can also see the IV has dropped significantly after earnings. Average IV was as high as 140% pre-earnings and is now sitting around 55%. IMO this is a fundamentally strong company with solid branding. If you\u2019ve ever needed to sign important documents online, chances are you\u2019ve used Docusign before and it is quickly becoming a household name. I like this play for a long-term hold and also as we get into the fall months as a covid play.",

This is where Theta gang rapes you.\n\nInstead, I went with shares in tech and semiconductors (in my case TTD and MU) then sold puts on them. This way I catch the ride back up without IV and Theta fucking me, while the put premiums let me IV fuck someone else. Shares also limit my downside exposure just in case SPY continues to fall. Once we see clear recovery, I\u2019m switching to Jan 21 calls on TQQQ with a few far OTM hedges every week on vol, then exiting sometime before the election.",

        "selftext": "Goldman predicts the price weakness \"will be short-lived\" and says that Micron is \"well-positioned competitively\" to profit as prices improve over the longer term. \n\n5G should drive growth.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the mobile business unit's growth easily outpaced that of other business segments, as well as Micron's overall revenue increase of 13%.\n\nMicron attributed this solid growth to an increase in demand for mobile dynamic random access memory (DRAM) as smartphone demand in China recovered. That recovery was primarily driven by the launch of 5G devices. \n\nThe good news for Micron is that 5G smartphones are just getting started. Fitch Ratings predicts that 5G smartphones will penetrate\u00a017% to 20% of the global smartphone market by 2021. That would be a nice jump considering that 24 million\u00a05G handsets were sold in the first quarter of 2020 out of a total of 274.8 million\u00a0smartphones. More importantly, 5G smartphones are expected to carry more mobile DRAM to support higher-resolution images, video, and intensive gaming. \n\nThis is is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are not suitable for everyone. Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.

        "selftext": "What's up people of r/StockMarket, some of you may have seen my unusual options activity posts in other option's trading sub-reddits. I've decided to put together a little summary for the week that details some trending tickers, option activity, and some setups for next week ( + reasoning for the setup). Mods if this isn't allowed, I won't post again. Here we go:\n\n# Upcoming Earnings\n\nMicron (MU) Earnings are coming up this week. The semi-conductor company has been consistently beating earnings and has seen some growth throughout the pandemic as more companies become increasingly tech-focused with work-from-home orders. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their most recent earnings and performance moves day-after the report.\n\n[https://imgur.com/stDsUEx](https://imgur.com/stDsUEx)\n\n**What to look for**\n\nBy proxy, companies that will see some related movements to MU\u2019s earnings are: AMD, INTC, and NVDA. A good showing from MU will also mean good things for other semi-conductor companies.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at MU\u2019s average options\u2019 Implied Volatility (IV) over the last month. We can see that typical IV is in the 40-45% range. When the stock price dropped early September during the crash, we saw IV get up to the 60\u2019s. IV has begun to dip back into the 40\u2019s meaning there is not a huge move expected off the earnings report. (Stock price is gold vs IV blue line).\n\n[https://imgur.com/87nthwQ](https://imgur.com/87nthwQ)\n\n# \n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nWe have some important economic data coming out this week. Here\u2019s the outlook:\n\nTuesday 10am: Consumer Confidence\n\nWednesday 8:30am: GDP Q2, Pending Home Sales\n\nThursday 8:30am: Jobless claims\n\nFriday 8:30am: Unemployment Rate\n\n**Full Calendar of Important Events w/ Forecasts (via Bloomberg):**\n\n[https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC](https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC)\n\n# \n\n# Trending Stocks\n\nMost Mentioned Tickers + Sentiment from Friday\n\n[https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO](https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO)\n\nThis week\u2019s trend gainers and losers\n\n**Losing Hype:** TSLA, VALE, NKLA, MSFT, WMT, AAPL\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB](https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB)\n\n**Gaining Hype:** BA, VXX, ZM, AAL, UPS, PTON, MU\n\n[https://imgur.com/hpakS2h](https://imgur.com/hpakS2h)\n\n\\*AAPL was losing hype on the weekly trend, but up on the daily trend Thursday &amp; Friday from a good performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Consolidating Tickers\n\nThese tickers are ones that have once been a \u201cmeme\u201d, but have since settled down, and perhaps a good entry point if your technicals are right, it aligns with your strategy, and want to avoid FOMO-ing into hot stocks.\n\n[https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a](https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a)\n\n# \n\n# The classic tale of doing the inverse of WSB\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at VALE, a stock that was almost never mentioned a single time in the last month on r/WallStreetBets until September 18th. At that point, the stock had risen 10% in the week before and VALE was then seen all over the comment section of the sub. Comment volume for VALE jumped to 10% of total comment volume on the sub-reddit at which point many WSB members initiated positions. Within the next several trading days the stock tanked 15% leaving WSB holding the bag (yet again). For more details on this, please read \u201cHow not to FOMO into trades\u201d.\n\n[https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B](https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B)\n\n# \n\n# Swaggy DD (due diligence) released this week - GME (Gamestop)\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\nWhen I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see comments like these, yet here we are. What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wallstreetbets thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week.\n\nIts no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\nJust to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically spiked.\n\n[Click here to continue reading the DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/)\n\n# \n\n# Swaggy Play &amp; Trade Idea - JPM\n\nWhat's up everyone, market has been choppy as FK and almost un-tradeable the last several weeks. Still, not much has changed fundamentally over the last 3-4 weeks and here we are with a 10-20% haircut on stocks depending which tickers you follow. I've been sitting on my hands for a while, but entered a trade today. Keep in mind this is not advice on what or how to trade, simply posting my trade here and if you want to discuss some opinions, lets do it.\n\nWhy JPM? It has been in a fairly tight channel over the last 3-4 months, staying in the range of $90-100. I entered this exact play back in July when the stock dropped to similar levels to where it is currently at right now, and closed at max profit back then.\n\n[Check out the full play details (reasoning + risks)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/izmt2r/swaggyplay_trade_idea_jpm/)\n\n# \n\n# Unusual Option Activity\n\nSome big volume in option flow was spotted this week in some names: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, and WRTC.\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nADBE saw a massive call block come through on Friday. 5,000 January 2021 CALLs at the $420 strike (10% ITM). Total position size was $40 million. ADBE was about 10-15% off the recent highs and has bounced multiple times off the $470 level. IF this sell-off is truly over, we might see a good bounce in tech and some of these block purchases seem to be positioning for it.\n\n[Read Full Post: Weekly Option Flow Summary, Week of Sept 20-2020: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, WRTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j0rev4/unusual_option_flow_summary_for_the_week_aapl/)\n\n# \n\n# What\u2019s on the watchlist this week\n\nStill looking for a bounce in tech. Here are some stocks I either like and have a position or I\u2019m looking for entry points on (stock price + Implied Volatility charts)\n\n**AAPL - Apple**\n\nAAPL is currently near a short-term low. Does it have room to go down more? Sure, but I think when you dig below the current levels you will be finding more buyers as we get closer to $100. IMO a good entry point for a long-term hold. IV is also moderately high for options. They are set to report earnings by end of October and also have catalyst of rumored 5g iPhone release.\n\n**AMD - Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD has shown some strength at the $78 level of support through these last few weeks of downside pressure. AMD also reports towards the end of October, but will have some volatility into MU (Micron Technology) earnings next week. IV is pretty high right now for AMD to buy calls. A more efficient play might be to sell CSP (cash-secured put), credit PUT spreads, or purchase shares.\n\n**DOCU - Docusign**\n\nA second-wave covid-play I\u2019m looking at is DOCU. DOCU just reported earnings that weren\u2019t accepted well by Wall Street. The stock has dropped nearly 30% since it\u2019s peak of $290 not long ago. You can also see the IV has dropped significantly after earnings. Average IV was as high as 140% pre-earnings and is now sitting around 55%. IMO this is a fundamentally strong company with solid branding. If you\u2019ve ever needed to sign important documents online, chances are you\u2019ve used Docusign before and it is quickly becoming a household name. I like this play for a long-term hold and also as we get into the fall months as a covid play.",

        "selftext": "(no promotional content, no affiliate links)\n\nHi,\n\nexactly four years ago, I started copying eToro investors / traders that I selected using the broker's built-in search engine (profitable in last two years, already being copied by others), followed by manual filtering, to take into account fluctuations in yearly returns, composition of their portfolios etc. With that, I got a list of 10 people whom I started to copy on a demo account:\n\n[https://www.investing-scientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/etoro\\_1.jpg](https://www.investing-scientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/etoro_1.jpg)\n\nIn the screenshot you can see that in case of the first two of them the amount invested was $10,000, while for the rest it was just $100. This is because I started copying the first two a couple of weeks earlier; eventually I changed this into $100 the same day I made the screenshot and this is when my calculations start - so this thing is irrelevant,  I just cannot travel in time to make another screenshot.\n\nWhat I did after that?\n\nWell, within the next six weeks my profits oscillated between -$11 and +$9.50 (the biggest profit was on Nov 9, a day after US presidential elections). I found this \"boring\" and discontinued experimenting with copy trading.\n\nToday I looked back at those ten traders. Here is what I found. Firstly, seven of them are not with eToro anymore; investorNo1, Simple-Stock-Mkt, tradingrelax, 4exPirate, primit, Gallojack, xjurokx. The other three traders are:\n\n* toppertrader: not being copied by anyone and for a good reason: his loss this year alone is 61.16%!\n* Jean-marcLenfant: copied by only 67 people; his loss this year is -1.09% but in general he is quite successful, with yearly profits ranging from 3.57% to 7.32%.\n* Girem2: he has no copiers, his profit this year is 41.45% but in 2018 he experienced a loss of 83.15%!\n\nMy observations and thoughts are as follows:\n\n1. Seven out of ten traders are not with eToro anymore, which makes me wonder why. I have no proof but my guess is they simply performed poorly, lost their copiers and closed their accounts. This is already alarming but what if they opened another account? Or, even worse, multiple accounts? They could be investing small money and try different risky approaches, hoping that at least one account will turn out profitable in the long turn, attracting potential copiers. (I'm not claiming that those 7 particular traders did this, it's just my general suspicion regarding some of eToro traders)\n2. I'm unable to calculate what would be my profit if I never stopped copying them, because I cannot check at what day and with what profit those seven traders left eToro. I'm guessing this would be an immense loss. On the other hand, considering the three traders who are still with eToro, I would **lose more than a quarter** of my assets!\n\nWhat now?\n\nI must be a quite adventurous person or at least an incorrigible optimist, because a month ago (exactly on Aug 26th) I started copying three traders with real money. Here is who they are.\n\n[rubymza](https://www.etoro.com/portfolio/rubymza) (Heloise Greeff)\n\n* invests in stocks, with GOOG, INTC, BLDP, MA, MSFT, AMZN, V, MU, IBM and NXPI making up 50.3% of her portfolio (allocation of each of them is in between 3.02% and 6.85%)\n* active since 2016 (only the year 2016 ended with a loss)\n* has 3044 copiers and $2M-$5M of copy assets under management\n* **strategy (her own words)**: \"My investing strategy focusses mostly on US indices, tech and pharma, promising future (5-10years) growth. My trades are based on technical analysis using machine learning to understand patterns and trends in the markets. I prefer to keep a diverse portfolio to spread risk while achieving great returns.\"\n* she [gave an interview for Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-12/six-things-you-re-doing-wrong-when-buying-stocks-on-your-own) a couple of weeks ago\n* own experience: I just happened to run across her second worst month ever on eToro; my loss is **-6.27%** at the time of writing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OlivierDanvel](https://www.etoro.com/portfolio/olivierdanvel) (Olivier Jean Andre Danvel)\n\n* he is a Forex trader, making typically 21 trades per week; his favorite currency pairs are EURCHF (12% of trades), CADCHF and GBPUSD; the trades, however, typically make up below 5% of his portfolio (at least whenever I'm checking it), making most of my funds unused\n* active since January 2017: surprisingly enough, he has every single month profitable, though monthly profits are in the range of 0.03% to 3.34% only\n* has 8977 copiers and more than $5M of copy assets under management\n* **strategy (his own words)**: \"I monitor currency pairs all day to find the best entry. There is some management/scaling position for perfect entry. The risk control is a big part of my strategy,\" (quite vague, to be honest)\n* own experience: my current profit is **0.26%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[rayvahey](https://www.etoro.com/portfolio/rayvahey) (Raymond Noel Vahey)\n\n* commodities compose 76% of his portfolio and his favorite assets are Gold and Oil (at the moment, Gold makes up half of invested amount)\n* active since July 2016, with the following  yearly profits, starting from 2016: 6.56%, 10.05%, 13.09%, 32.26% and -2.03% (the current year)\n* has 1493 copiers and $1M-$2M of copy assets under management\n* **strategy (his own words)**: \"My system is based on patterns, and a variety of technical analysis tools and some fundamental analysis. I primarily trade in commodities. \" (quite vague as well)\n* own experience: my profit with rayvahey is **2.56%**\n\nWhat was my strategy to hand-pick these particular traders? First I did some basic scanning using eToro's built-in search engine. The most important filter was that the trader was profitable within the last two years: unfortunately, eToro does not allow to reach details of earlier performance automatically. To know how the trader performed before 2019, I had to look at stats in the profile of each of them. I was also taking into account how often they trade (to avoid those who do only a couple of trades yearly), whether they were trading recently and whether they write posts regularly in their feed. With this, I got a list of fifteen candidates to copy:\n\n* olivierdanvel\n* marianopardo\n* rubymza\n* rayvahey\n* martidg97\n* overit\n* misterg23\n* knw500\n* jianswang\n* reinhardtcoetzee\n* miyoshi\n* alderique\n* jarodd76\n* benson9904\n* big-profits\n\nAs you already know, I finally chose three of them. Rubymza seemed to be the most trustworthy stock trader, based on profits, posts feed and regular trading, among other things.  Regarding OlivierDanvel, his uniqueness is the ability to record continuous profits with the Forex market. Finally, with rayvahey I wanted to increase my exposure to the commodities market.\n\nWish me good luck!\n\n*Michael*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.\n\nYou might find those copy-trading related readings interesting:\n\n* https://www.etoro.com/copytrader/\n* https://www.investopedia.com/etoro-review-5072808\n* https://socialtradingvlog.com/\n* https://stockupwithjoe.com/etoro-copy-trader/\n* https://blockonomi.com/etoro-copy-trading-guide/\n* https://www.quora.com/Does-copying-best-traders-concept-of-etoro-really-work\n* https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-get-rich-by-copying-the-trades-of-top-traders-in-eToro-Zulu-trade/answer/Lutz-Enke\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclosures**:\n\n* What you see here is my personal opinion, my own investments and should not be treated as investing advice\n* I\u2019m an amateur investor",

        "selftext": "Stocks are higher again today following a bounce on Friday. With that comes a slight contraction of expected moves from last week. This will be interesting to watch as trader focus the past few weeks has been on the major indices and only stock specific in so far as watching some of the more frothy names come back to earth. It doesn't look like that valuation adjustment translated into an overall market rout as the market found footing in the past few days. Earnings come back into focus starting next week and of course the election looms. For now, options volatility seems fairly stubborn, stuck in the high 20's in the VIX and not really collapsing with the market bounce. If volatility stays elevated no matter what the market does that could translate into more realized volatility in the indices (both up and down) due to short gamma on the delta-neutral side, while single stock names could overprice their own event moves as options may be reflecting broader market move fears.\n\n*Expected moves via Options AI technology,*\n\n* VIX is \\~26.50 this morning.\n* Last week's expected move in SPY: 2.5%\n* Last week\u2019s actual move SPY: 0.9%\n* This week's expected move in SPY: 2.2%:\n\n[SPY Expected move chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-9.09.56-AM.png)\n\n* Last week's expected move in QQQ: 3.2%\n* Last week's actual move in QQQ: 3.2%\n* This week's expected move in QQQ: 2.9%\n\n[QQQ Expected move chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-9.15.40-AM.png)\n\nA look at some of the weekly expected moves for some stocks in the news this morning, SNAP, SPOT, CZR, CVX, UPS:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/pz749g5obxp51.gif\n\nEarnings announcements are light in the lull between quarters.

Dollar somewhat higher vs euro while little changed vs the yen. Gold down 0.6%.

        "selftext": "After cashing in on MU calls this morning, like the rest of us, I immediately noticed a sharp drop in tech stocks, which made me reconsider the future of the VIX, which has trended up more than 20% since Aug 18, even as the SPY continues to reach new highs.\n\nOur friend [Mohamed El-Erian](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447) credits the the decoupling of the of the VIX from the SPY largely on due to retail investors continuing to chase the parabolic climb in tech stocks with as many calls as they can, assuming the ride will never end. The last time this happened (think Sept '19 - Feb '20), the VIX eventually hit a new ATH and SPY fell 32%. I don't see this happening again at all, at least in the short term, especially if the recession turns into a depression and a longer term low forms below the bottom reached on March 23, 2020. \n\nWhile premiums are high on VXX and UVXY, they should imply that the market is anticipating an increase in volatilty leading up to the election, or for reasons yet to be understood. In my opinion, the SPY is being bought up even more intraday to counter the affects of rising volatility. Keep in mind that the increase in volatility is occuring alongside the continuous actions of the Fed. The last thing we should do is fight the Fed, but how long can this massive disconnect from reality continue?",

This is where Theta gang rapes you.\n\nInstead, I went with shares in tech and semiconductors (in my case TTD and MU) then sold puts on them. This way I catch the ride back up without IV and Theta fucking me, while the put premiums let me IV fuck someone else. Shares also limit my downside exposure just in case SPY continues to fall.
