Especially in an era where you need to make quick changes on the fly or see how users are reacting with your service, Fastly is able to not only give you 100% of your logs in near real-time to most endpoints in the market, but we also allow you to update configurations and roll back as quickly as you can. Even from a content perspective, we\u2019re able to instantly-purge content on your site to ensure content is fresh and most up to date. Companies also choose Fastly because of how API-friendly we are. We are the market leader in dynamic content delivery whereas legacy players have issues with caching what we call event-driven or dynamic content. This means that we can cache more and effectively outperform the market. DevOps teams love to use Fastly because you can add custom logic to the network edge so that they can either make quick changes without the cost of professional services. Saying this, though, our partners are amazed at the support that Fastly can provide, on top of the extensive documentation on the developers hub that your team has on-hand. Companies also really love the fact that Fastly is a single network, no matter the size of your organisation. We integrate our DDoS, WAF and other security offerings into the edge to improve visibility and performance for everyone.\"",

        "selftext": "I sold my NET stock few days ago with good profit (at around 57$, 87% up), and I have about 10K worth of WCLD. I was looking into all the holdings of WCLD, and I was surprised there is no akamai (check [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld)).\n\nI started digging and I came across this very good comparison of the major cloud companies:\n\n[https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/)\n\nas you can see, it seems akamai has like 55% of market share, while NET and FASTLY are around 1%. The blog was from July, but I don't think things have changed dramatically since then. \n\nFrom reading the blog, it seems to me for big companies, akam seems to be the first choice for the biggest websites (facebook, adobe, ibm, to mention few).\n\nThen I started looking into the valuations, and I found this article from today comparing Akamai and Fastly\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001)\n\nIt was very eye opening, specially, the following table below  (Revenue and operating income are Guidances for 2020)\n\n    Company | Revenue | Operating Income  | Mkt Cap | P/S  | P/E   |  P/E (forward)\n    ---------|----------|-----------------|---------| ---- | ------|-----------------\n    FSLY  | $295 M |$7 million| $14.5 B | 54.0 | N/A  | 1,110\n    AKAM  | $3,150 M |$961 million| $18.8 B | 6.1 | 35  | 20.3\n\nThere is another table shown the revenue growth, where FSLY obviously have better figure (62% Q2 revenue growth for FSLY vs 13% for Akam), but Akam is still doing better when you look into margins \n\nI know the cloud market is growing, and Akam will not be able to keep the 55% market share. But still, how come it is almost not discussed here?\n\nSo after this quick research, I am thinking of buying a good 4-6K worth of Akamai. Any reasons why I shouldn't do that?  \n\nPS: Fsly, even after the big drops today and yesterday, is still up around 350% YTD, on the other hand, AKAM is only 26% up (NET is around 250% up YTD)",

        "selftext": "NET and AKAM dropping on the FSLY revenue news is crazy in my view and a buying opportunity. [The huge spike of fake fancy bear DDoS extortion attacks](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/09/major-global-ransom-denial-of-service-campaign-continues-rising-trend-in-global-ddos-attacks/) is going to be a revenue and earnings driver for both companies. The levels of DDoS attacks happening around the world right now is simply unprecedented and driving companies to adopt DDoS mitigation services at rates never seen before.  In the security industry we are calling this DDoS extortion campaign the 3rd pandemic along with COVID and Ransomware. \n\nThe [FBI](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-thousands-of-orgs-targeted-by-rdos-extortion-campaign/amp/) is saying THOUSANDS of organizations have been hit since mid August. These companies are being driven into the arms of AKAM and NET to avoid extortion demands of 20-30 beetcoins (dont kill my post bot). Depending on the provider and the customer characteristics, these contracts will have a $50-$200K one time emergency set up fee and monthly recurring charges between $5K-$50K based on the bandwidth the website or the network consumes.  It\u2019s also worth mentioning that [OFAC warned on October 1st](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.natlawreview.com/article/ofac-advisory-warns-civil-penalties-ransomware-payments%3famp) that companies who pay ransoms to sanctioned entities may face civil liabilities making it SUPER risky for a company to pay an extortion demand. \n\nAKAM is the gold standard for critical firms like Financial Services and was [engaged](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-shifts-to-akamai-says-trading-continues-despite-site-being-down-again/6PRQ5W7SAMXA5Z5FKVRTQCSIXI/) when NZX Stock Exchange was hit in August. Their prices are high, but top tier firms are willing to pay. AKAM should be able to take a significant amount of the high end of the market. They have maintained market share and grown despite new entrants to the CDN market. Their Kona  platform is hugely capable at wrapping security and DDoS mitigation services around CDN. Their Prolexic Scrubbing Centers offer some of the industry\u2019s best network layer DDoS mitigation (Prolexic was best in class at this in 2014 when they were acquired by AKAM and only got better with scale).  \n\nNET stands to massively benefit from this spike in DDoS attacks as well. Their \u201cfreemium\u201d business model is designed for events like this. In a [recent investor presentation ](https://cloudflare.net/files/doc_downloads/Presentations/2020/q2/Cloudflare-Q2-2020-Investor-Presentation_FINAL.pdf) they discuss how they invert the typical marketing approach and rely on customers to \u201cpull\u201d them into new services and markets. This is the type of storm them have been waiting for. Their CDN and \u201cSpectrum\u201d application layer DDoS mitigation services give AKAM a run for their money and their network/BGP layer \u201cMagic Transit\u201d services are innovative and disruptive.  The current \u201cfake fancy bear\u201d attacks will likely drive significant Magic Transit revenue because these attacks are aimed at the network layer.  The beautiful thing here is the cost of this revenue is almost nothing because of their demand/pull business model and the fact that Magic Transit capacity is only utilized during an active attack. In other words, NET can put massive numbers of customers on the Magic Transit platform and not consume additional resources.  NET is also small enough that doubling or tripling security services revenue will have a big impact on the overall P&amp;L. \n\nTo put the scale of these attacks in perspective, I\u2019ve talked to engineers at one of the largest and most respected domain registrars. In many cases if you want to enable DDoS mitigation services you must modify your domain registration record to point to a new set of DNS servers. This change is usually a quick phone call and takes 5-10 minutes. This domain registrar said they have been making DNS server changes for companies that needed DDoS mitigation services 24x7.... for 5 weeks straight!!!  They said it\u2019s been unlike anything they have ever seen.   While this is an indirect indicator, I believe it\u2019s a pretty good proxy of demand happening over at AKAM and NET and is the reason I went long on both recently. \n\nSo... yeah. Buy the dip...",

        "selftext": "**US equities lower: Dow (2.81%), S&amp;P 500 (2.89%), Nasdaq (3.11%), Russell 2000 (2.63%)**\n\n* US equities under broad-based pressure with all sectors lower in Wednesday morning trading. S&amp;P down for a third straight session. Energy, tech, comm services, materials among the big decliners. FAANGs mostly underperforming. Defensives holding up best and industrials, healthcare also among the outperformers. Treasuries mostly stronger with some curve flattening. 10-year yields down for a fourth straight session. Dollar seeing good gains vs euro and sterling but little changed vs the yen. Gold down 1.9%. WTI crude down 5.8%.\n* **Worsening coronavirus trends** remain the big overhang on risk sentiment with the focus on rising case counts, hospitalizations and most importantly from an economic perspective, consumer behavioral changes and fresh mitigation measures. Vaccine optimism, which has long offset other coronavirus-related concerns, has also been dented a bit from a timing perspective. **Near-term fiscal stimulus expectations continue to fade** with no sign of progress between Democrats and White House in recent days. **Election risk** another overhang with some recent tightening in the polls (and lingering polling skepticism). **Earnings beat rates elevated but slipping** and stock price reactions suggest a lot of good news already priced in and focus may be elsewhere (coronavirus, election).\n* **Big earnings day** and now 40% of S&amp;P 500 has reported. According to FactSet, 81% have surpassed consensus EPS estimates, better than the 73% one- and five-year averages. However, this is down from the 84% seen at the end of last week. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings 15.6% above expectations, better than the 8.0% and 5.6% respective one- and five-year year average positive surprise rates, but down from 17.2% last week and the 23% beat rate in Q3.\n* Several higher-profile names reported today. Takeaways somewhat complicated by outsized macro focus today. **MSFT-US** beat and analysts continued to highlight cloud momentum but there some transactional headwinds and revenue guide was a bit light. **MA-US** missed on both top and bottom line though coronavirus concerns/European exposure may be bigger issue for the stock. **UPS-US** beat but domestic volume growth moderated and expectations elevated given e-commerce narrative. **GE-US** a standout with focus on better industrial FCF and Q4 guide for that metric. **ADP-US** beat and raised on pickup in business activity.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+15.7% **FSLR-US** (First Solar): Q3 earnings and revenue beat strongly, reinstated Q4 guidance with midpoint a bit ahead of consensus; analysts noted increased visibility, stronger system sales, clearing prior backlog in Asia projects, cost reduction plan on target though Malaysian production a risk due to Covid travel restrictions.\n* \\+15.5% **CLGX-US** (CoreLogic): CNBC's David Faber said company engaging potential buyers and receiving bids at more than $80/sh (vs Tuesday's $68.25 close); said has already signed an NDA with one party; CSGP-US mentioned as a potential buyer.\n* \\+8.7% **GE-US** (General Electric): Q3 revenue, EPS and operating profit beat; Street takeaways focused on unexpectedly positive industrial FCF, better industrial FCF guidance for Q4, industrial EBIT upside, lack of major surprises on impairment testing, stronger healthcare, still soft aviation.\n* \\+7.3% **ADP-US** (ADP): Big FQ1 earnings beat with revenue better; highlighted tailwinds from improving economies and increased business activity; raised FY guidance; noted strong start to new business bookings.\n* \\+1.5% **GRMN-US** (Garmin): Q3 earnings, revenue, and margins beat; sales above consensus in every segment; notable strength in Fitness amid higher demand for fitness/cycling products; FY guidance better than the Street.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-17.3% **ELY-US** (Callaway Golf): Confirmed merger with Topgolf previously reported by WSJ; company will \\~$2B of shares and take on Topgolf's $555M of debt; deal expected to be dilutive until 2025; analysts upbeat on Topgolf as an asset but also noted how it changes the Callaway stock narrative; company also issued a positive Q3 preannouncement with the deal news.\n* \\-11% **DXCM-US** (Dexcom): Q3 earnings beat while revenue was same as pre-reported 26-Oct, guidance raised to levels in line with Street; analysts noted solid results in Pharmacy and Medicare and record patient additions; however G7 will launch as 10 day sensor instead of 14 day, increased competition and pricing challenges despite \\~70% share price outperformance ytd.\n* \\-9% **BBBY-US** (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond): Three-year financial roadmap sees stable comps in 2021; planning for $1 - $1.5B in capital investments including store revamps; launching $225M accelerated buyback; comes after stock has rallied \\~130% in past three months.\n* \\-6.2% **UPS-US** (UPS): Q3 earnings and revenue beat with guidance withheld; noted improvement in small and medium sized businesses and continued strength outbound from Asia; analysts discussed high expectations, moderation of domestic volume growth, higher cost per piece, though recent price increases may benefit results going forward.\n* \\-6.1% **AKAM-US** (Akamai): Q3 earnings, revenue, operating margins were a bit ahead; analysts noted in line Q4 guidance relies to an extent on one off factors; Security segment which is important to valuation argument has decelerated somewhat; some concern over peak-traffic; however results mostly solid benefitting from currently elevated traffic levels in OTT video and gaming.\n* \\-6.1% **CHRW-US** (C.H. Robinson): Q3 revenue, EPS beat, though low quality on better taxes; operating income missed; reduced FY20 capex guidance; analysts flagged weaker North America truckload volume growth, weaker net revenue margins from contract commitments and elevated spot rates.\n* \\-5.8% **MA-US** (MasterCard): Q3 revenue and EPS light; takeaways somewhat mixed with focus on continued weakness in cross-border, headwind from other revenues and processing fees, lower rebates and operating expenses, stable to better October volume trends, and risks from second coronavirus wave (particularly with its exposure to Europe).\n* \\-4.4% **CME-US** (CME Group): Q3 EPS missed; revenue in line, though clearing and transaction fees weaker; analysts cautious on impact of low rate and weak energy sector backdrop, flagged weaker Q4 volume trends as EPS headwind.\n* \\-3% **MSFT-US** (Microsoft): Fiscal Q1 revenue and EPS beat with all segments ahead; Street takeaways largely positive with focus on cloud momentum/leverage to digital transformation push; Azure growth beat consensus and what several analysts noted was a higher whisper number; however, some focus on transactional headwinds and slightly below consensus Dec Q guidance.\n\n09:28:54 AM CDT on 28 Oct '20",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 8, 2020**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending yesterday\u2019s frankly unexpected gains, with the major benchmarks opening at their highest levels in about a month. Market participants digested a new round of jobless claims, dimming hopes of stimulus, even for stand-alone bills, and progress in Covid-19 therapeutics following Pres. Trump\u2019s discharge from the hospital.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.54% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) led the day, up 0.85% and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.48% up. \n\nToday, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claims report. There were 840,000 additional first-time jobless claims this week, slightly above the 820,000 prediction of analysts. While 840,000 is the lowest level since March, jobless claims have stagnated the past month, a sign of slowing economic recovery. Continuing claims, which are the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment, fell below 11 million, dropping almost 1 million compared to the week before. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \u201cThe decline in continuing claims is welcome, but initial claims offer a better read on the real-time state of the labor market, and the downward trend has stalled, more or less.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, there are still 25.5 million workers claiming some form of unemployment benefits, according to totals through Sept. 19. More than half that total, or about 13.4 million, comes from those collecting under pandemic-related programs set up for those who normally wouldn\u2019t be eligible, showing the toll the pandemic has put on the labor market. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi further curbed expectations that any form of stimulus will be unleashed before the November election. Today, in response to a bill designed to provide relief to the airline industry, Pelosi said, \u201cThere is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.\u201d In other words, she opposes passing smaller, stand-alone stimulus bills in the absence of more comprehensive measures. Yesterday, after calling for his representatives to stop negotiations for overarching stimulus, Pres. Trump signaled he would support a smaller, targeted bill. In response to Trump\u2019s recent tweets about stimulus, Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James said, \u201cIt\u2019s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into \\[Tuesday\u2019s\\] close, and then the rally.\u201d Needless to say, the current market is hyper-responsive to the comments of Trump and other top officials.\n\nShares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. In a video on Twitter today, Pres. Trump openly endorsed the move saying \u201cI took this medicine \\[during his stay at Walter Reed Hospital\\] and it was incredible.\u201d\n\nIn other nice news, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that South Korea\u2019s trade minister and the former Nigerian finance minister are the two finalists in the race to become the next director-general. This is the first time a woman will occupy the position of top leader in this organization. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Covid Relief pushes US deficit to a record $3.1T\n* AMD announced new desktop processors today that the company said will deliver significant improvements in gaming performance. The Ryzen 9 5950X chip delivers what the company described as the \u201chighest single-thread performance of any desktop gaming processor.\u201d\n* Gamestop (GME) announced that it has entered into a multi-year strategic partnership agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to further advance its strategy to expand its physical and digital video game offerings, as well as enhance the Company\u2019s retail technology infrastructure. GME rocketed up 20% on the announcement.\n* Morgan Stanley (MS) said it is buying fund manager Eaton Vance (EV) Corp. for $7 billion, continuing the Wall Street firm's shift toward safer businesses like money management. The deal comes just days after Morgan Stanley completed its $11 billion takeover of E\\*Trade\n* Weed stocks got a big boost today afet Vice Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris said in yesterday\u2019s debate that the Biden administration would federally decriminalize marijuana. TLRY up 17.5%, CGC up 13%, ACB up 11%, APHA up 10%, CRON 9.6%, and CURLF up 10.5% to name a few of the most popular ones.\n* Square (SQ) bought 4,709 bitcoins (around $50M). The company said \"Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system\"\n* ROKU had a target raised by Needham from $190 to $255. Stock is currently at an All Time High. Amazon AMZN announced Roku would be available on Amazon FireStick.\n* Paypal (PYPL) had target raised by KeyCorp from $215 to $230 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Norfolk Southern (NSC) had all sorts of target raises today.

        "selftext": " **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**\n\nStocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. \n\nThe three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities\u2019 third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&amp;P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.\n\nIt seems traders are expecting September\u2019s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.\n\nFor the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.\n\nThe labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks\u2019 report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**\n\nStocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. \n\nThe three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities\u2019 third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&amp;P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.\n\nIt seems traders are expecting September\u2019s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.\n\nFor the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.\n\nThe labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks\u2019 report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September\u2019s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we\u2019ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI).
