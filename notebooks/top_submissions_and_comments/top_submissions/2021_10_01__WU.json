        "selftext": "Western Union is a financial services company that specializes in the transfer of money. \n\nWhen I was a kid, Western Union was the place mi mama would take me on her errand run. \n\nShe would send money to relatives in Ecuador through Western Union wire transfers.\n\nSometimes the transfer didn't occur or a relative was \"shaken down\" by someone controlling those transfers. There was always a toll man in some fashion. Always wanting their cut. \n\nI distinctly remember my mother being upset at the wait time and fees for a cousin who would be dying soon (we suspect cancer). \n\nAs you can imagine, the fees were awful and the service was difficult. \n\nToday Western Union is a dying business that is losing millions of customers by the week. \n\nHow? Why? \n\nKrypto baby. It's here and the guy mowing your lawn is transferring his paycheck via ehthereum or bitecoin or Monero or polygon. \n\nThe list is immense and also not necessarily difficult to execute now. \n\nSo why **after** Q4?\n\nWestern Union stock shows a beta of 0.99, so going into the holiday season we will see a price increase. \n\nThe ETF exposure of Western Union is fairly high. \n\nThis tells me that people have western union on their balance sheets as a safe bet. \n\n\"Immigrants will always need to send money\" \n\nI believe Q4 earnings will be bad but this will be eclipsed by the bullish market. \n\nQ1 earnings will be so abysmal that even boomers will drop Western Union.\n\nThis is my big short and I am emotionally invested.",

        "selftext": "Took this info from another site but thought it would be good considering the BTC hype right now. Cheaper bitcoin/blockchain penny stocks to watch and potential reasons why:\n\n**$PBTS:**  \nPowerbridge established a new Singapore-based crypto mining and digital asset subsidiary. This new Powercrypto company will establish a green, renewable energy crypto mining arm for the company. You also can\u2019t ignore the launch of Powercrypto\u2019s Hong Kong operations. This is another environmentally-friendly cryptocurrency mining initiative from the company, with an expected deployment of 2,600 mining rigs.  \n\n\n**$GRNQ:**  \nAmong other initiatives like spinning off tech incubators like SEATech Ventures Corp. (OTC:SEAV), Greenpro invests directly into digital asset exchanges. Last month the company took stakes in two projects, Link Capital and Samothracec International (ATM Online).  \n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, CEO CK Lee has grown much more bullish on the prospects of this latest investment. \u201cWe are very excited to kick off our Pre-STO Investment Program with Link Capital and ATM online, both have excellent professional management team and are in businesses that are poised to capture significant upside from pent-up demand and decentralized finance momentum.\u201d  \n\n\n**$NXTP:**  \nOn October 4th, NextPlay revealed that it entered into a stock exchange agreement with NextBank International (f/k/a International Financial Enterprise Bank). This is a new subsidiary that was initially acquired in July. This gets NextPlay involved directly with the FinTech space. In particular, this includes engaging in opportunities in alternative asset management, including cryptocurrency and blockchain securitization. This adds to the companies previous acquisition earlier in the year of Token IQ. This purchase offers capabilities for handling things like Kow Your Customer to help with regulatory requirements. NextPlay also explained that it plans to integrate the service into NextBank International as well. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that its CEO picked up 1.99 million shares at an average price of $2 earlier this month.  \n\n\n**$BTB:**  \nSus...but...In Bit Brother\u2019s case, it may lean more toward cryptocurrency utilization with retail transactions. Earlier this year, the company announced an LOI for acquiring 51% of Angelo\u2019s Pizza with plans for expanding the century-old brand. Bit Brother discussed expanding the company\u2019s reach into international markets. These would include Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, Singapore, and Australia. Where cryptocurrency comes into play (for now) is when it comes to payment.  \n\n\nAccording to CEO Xianlong Wu, \u201cAlong with our plans to expand a restaurant with decades of success to have a global reach, we will be able to continue to grow our Bitcoin payment business.\u201d  \n\n\n**$DMGGF:**  \n**T**he company reported multiple successful transactions with Zodia Custody. Zodia acts as a crypto asset custodian incubated by Standard Chartered with Northern Trust as a co-investor. Zodia will be using DMG\u2019s Blockseer platform \u201cPetra\u201d from its Core+ suite of services. This new platform allows subscribers multiple ways of proceeding with transactions. Petra allows everything from Know Your Customer (KYC) wallets and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks on transactions to enhance the safety and security of digital transactions. Regulatory and compliance initiatives have begun making waves in the cryptocurrency space. Companies like DMG have seen this as an early opportunity.",

In all transparency, I have 19,980 shares of CASI at a $1.33 average as of 10/6/2021. I also want to preface this, noting that I have been researching CASI since June 6th, and have spoken with the CEO He Wei-Wu via email, with a planned meeting in December 2021. Additional clinical trial data and information in excel format can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DyATO67OLAN4NEKSIeFMX34BGWSt26g1OZrCvbQuNkM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DyATO67OLAN4NEKSIeFMX34BGWSt26g1OZrCvbQuNkM/edit?usp=sharing). Based on the experience of CASI\u2019s management team, promising clinical data of their assets, well structured co-commercialization agreements, revenue growth of Evomela, cash on hand, negligible debt, and upcoming catalyst, I believe CASI is in the best position it has ever been since its IPO in 1996 (formerly EntreMed). \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAbove are CASI\u2019s assets currently in development that I will explain in more detail below. It is important to note that unlike many clinical stage pharma companies, CASI already has a drug on the market. Evomela is already generating revenue for CASI, set to exceed revenue growth of +80% in 2021. The CEO has noted that Evolmela\u2019s revenue is close to generating enough capital to cover all sales and marketing expenses. More importantly, Evomela is allowing CASI to build a sales pipeline for their other oncology/hematology assets. This means, upon approval of drugs such as CNCT19, BI-1206, and CID-103 they will be selling to the same hospitals and doctors that are already purchasing Evomela. While this is just opinion, I also believe that having achieved approval with Evomel from the NMPA (Chinese FDA) they are even more likely to be approved with other assets. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nCASI\u2019s market cap is currently around $158m, with 139.8m shares outstanding and a 97m float. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe company has shifted in recent years to place their focus on developing and commercializing their drugs in China. This is primarily due to China's rising cancer population, facilitated approval process, less competition, and to ride the wave as more $ is flowing into R&amp;D and STEM in China than ever before as China is transitioning from a manufacturing/industrial powerhouse to an R&amp;D &amp; biotechnology powerhouse.\n\nIt is important to note that CASI is focused on building its business through partnerships, co-commercialization agreements, and equity stakes in other therapeutic and pharmaceutical companies. In the above Google Sheet document, I have detailed all economic status regarding these partnerships for each drug candidate. For example, CNCT-19 is being developed by Juventas, BI-1206 by BioInvent, CB-5339 by Cleave Therapeutics, and so on. These deals have allowed CASI to secure promising lead drug candidates that, if approved, gives CASI exclusive licensing and commercialization in the Greater China region. It also greatly reduces their R&amp;D expenses as the only asset they are responsible for conducting clinical trials, is their CID-103 in partnership with Black Belt Therapeutics. \n\nI would like to focus on their t-cell therapy CNCT-19 as it is the nearest to trial completion, shows very promising results, and poses greatest revenue potential based on competitor analysis. Their CNCT19 is currently being developed by Juventas Therapeutics. It is important to note that in addition to a co-commercialization agreement, the CASI Ceo\u2019s Emerging Tech Partners Fund (no affiliation with CASI) is a private investor in Juventas. And Casi has taken an equity stake themselves. So their belief is this asset is clear as day and they have a lot on the line. CNCT19 is an innovative cancer treatment for ALL and NHL, and has competitors that I can use for potential revenue modeling. If approved, CNCT-19 will be the only domestically manufactured t-cell therapy in China. Because of this CASI expects their drug to be much more affordable compared to current treatments that average around $300,000. BTIG released a report in May 2021, explaining that if CASI can offer their drug for under $80,000 their price target would increase from $4 to **$21** (screenshot below). Their current CAR-T competitors include Novartis' Kymriah ($298m in revenue in the first half of 2021) and Gilead's Yescarta ($338 million in the first half of 2021). CASI is currently near debt-free status, with enough cash ($73m in C&amp;CE Q2 2021) runway to fund operations through 2023, with a current burn rate of only $6m (Oppenheimer). Their CNCT-19 results, showed that 90% of patients reached complete remission within 28 days, and there was a 95% confidence level after a 24-month follow-up.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTheir BI-1206 also looks promising, it is BioInvent\u2019s lead drug candidate, and I feel a bit more confident knowing that Merck has a stake here as well. The BioInvent CEO spoke in September on LinkedIn, mentioning that we should be expecting news by the end of the year, regarding the IND submission.  \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nUpcoming Catalyst for this year: \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOne of the most interesting this about CASI, aside from its promising drug candidates, is the unprecedented amount of insider buying from the CEO. Here is the list of ever single transaction since 2012: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13WRGvtmRTyDUauYpnEwLRahNUviPEvmRZEFkLQWuSzA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13WRGvtmRTyDUauYpnEwLRahNUviPEvmRZEFkLQWuSzA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe CEO currently owns about 15% of the company, with a little more than 21 million shares as an estimated cost per share of $2.06 based on common stock purchases. The stock is currently near its all time lows...currently trading around $1.17 and I expect to be near the bottom. Since 2012, there have only been 2 disposals from the CEO and both transactions were \u201cGifts\u201d in very small amounts. It is safe to say that he has been loading the boat and this is something that I take into consideration. Especially when considering his accomplishments in the past with his Emerging Tech Partners fund. \n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**  \n\n\n**Insider ownership****\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nCASI also has $60 million in cash as of their latest filing for the period ending June 30th, 2021. Based on their burn rate this is enough cash through 2023, so I do not expect another offering in the foreseeable future. [https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-011386/](https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-011386/)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n1 year/1 day chart: (my apologies for lines and messiness) **\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nIt is clear to see a significant uptick in volume in recent months. \n\n5 year/week chart:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nCASI is also building a 100,000 Sqm GMP manufacturing facility set to be completed in 2023. In November 2019, CASI Wuxi entered into a fifty-year lease agreement for the right to use state-owned land in China for the construction of a manufacturing facility (74,028 sq meters. CASI pre-paid all of the lease payments for the land use rights in 2019 in the amount fo $6.5 million. \n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**  \n\n\n**Current Ratings:**\n\nBTIG: $4 price target ($21 if CNCT19 approved at a $50,000 treatment cost)\n\nOppenheimer: $6\n\nH.C.

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm an expat in Bahrain who wants invest in Indian stock exchanges. So, imagine I convert BHD to INR to buy stocks on the Indian market. Firstly, I'll have to pay a commison fee to Western Union who would convert and transfer my money to my Indian bank account from which I'll trade with. Let's say after I exit the market and would like to have the money back to my Bahrain bank account. I would again have to a fee for the money transfer. \nSo my question is, is this the right way of trading when your local currency is different from the one you're investing in? And is there just a better option to trade with different currencies altogether. Because I feel like its a loss if I have to pay 1.25 BHD for every time I money transfer from different accounts. \nI would really appreciate any advice on this. Thanks.",

The country is experiencing the fastest expansion of consumer spending power the world has ever seen, and by 2027, almost 1.2 billion Chinese will be in the middle class, making up a quarter of the world\u2019s middle class.2 Chinese consumers have followed the path of their Western counterparts, with economic growth driving investments in home ownership, vehicle purchases, as well as stimulating demand for high quality discretionary products. At the same time though, Chinese consumers have set their own trends through rapid adoption of e-commerce and digital finance. Moreover, China is not just the \u2018consumption epicentre\u2019 of the world, it is also home to an excellent entrepreneurial culture with a vibrant stock market. There are close to 5,000 publicly listed firms in the country, which in terms of its breadth and depth is matched by only a few other nations such as the United States.\nHowever, the history of capitalism is relatively short in China. The government still runs large parts of the economy and retains considerable influence across a wide range of industries. As investors in Emerging Market countries, crony capitalism and state influence are not foreign to us, but what makes China unique is the way state or crony influence subtly blends into the private sector. Ownership is blurred between private sector and state influenced actors, and the real shareholders are hidden to such an extent that it is often difficult to determine what is genuinely private. This vagueness is compounded by a lack of free media, as well as the absence of an independent court system and respect for private property rights, which many Western investors usually take for granted.\nFat Geese businessmen\nWu Xiaohui started out as a low-level bureaucrat in Wenzhou, a city known for its entrepreneurialism. In 1996, he got a dealership license for SAIC, a large state-owned automobile company which manufactured Volkswagen and General Motors cars in China. During this time, he also cultivated a close relationship with Zhuo Ran, the granddaughter of China\u2019s former paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. He eventually married her and used the Deng family\u2019s considerable political clout, to obtain licenses to sell auto-insurance and other financial services. He also forged a close relationship with Chen Xiaolu, who was a prominent princeling3, as the son of Marshal Chen Yi (one of the eight leading Generals in Mao\u2019s revolutionary army).\nBy 2010, Wu\u2019s flagship company Anbang Insurance was sufficiently large enough to bid for large prestigious property plots in major Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. In 2014, Anbang bought New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel for USD 1.9 billion, which was the highest amount ever paid for a single property. In 2016, it tried to acquire Starwood Hotels (owner of Sheraton, Westin and W brands) for USD 14 billion. By 2017, Anbang emerged as one of the largest insurance companies in the country by asset size (USD 300 billion). Even with this size, its shareholder structure and the exact source of its funds was never entirely clear. Anbang\u2019s takeover of Fidelity and Guaranty Life, an insurer operating in Iowa and New York was blocked by local regulators in 2016, as Anbang failed to provide information on its opaque shareholder structure.\nThe Chinese government decided to put the brakes on these big-ticket deals to acquire trophy Western assets in early 2017, and around the same time, Wu seemed to have lost political backing in Beijing. Soon, the Chinese insurance regulator stopped Anbang from selling new insurance products, and it seemed that Anbang had lost the support of large Chinese banks. The government eventually seized control of the company in early 2018 and Wu ended up with 18 years jail sentence for fraud and embezzlement.\nThere is a long list of such \u2018fat geese\u2019 billionaires, at the top of China\u2019s corporate food chain; Chen Feng (HNA group, linked to Wang Qishan, Xi Jinping\u2019s trusted aide), Wang Jianlin (Dalian Wanda group, linked to Xi Jinping\u2019s sister), Xiao Jianhua (Tomorrow Holdings, close to Jiang Zemin, China\u2019s supreme leader from 1989-2002), Guo Guangchang (Fosun International, close ties with Ling Jinhua, a former top aide of Hu Jintao, President of China from 2003-2013), and Jack Ma (Alibaba, closely linked to the Shanghai faction of the Party, chronicled in our Winter 2020 investor letter).\nWhile the prominent \u2018fat geese\u2019 billionaires are well documented by media, information on smaller corrupt and politically connected businessmen is not as readily available. Yet, the culture of cronyism, corruption and favouritism goes all the way down to small/mid-size companies. Many prominent private equity funds in the country are populated with princelings who help the investee companies win government favours through their connections. For example, a major medical diagnostics chain we evaluated for a potential investment had multiple minority investors in various labs they ran across the country; and most of these minority investors were relatives of locally influential party officials. This chain also had an equity investment from a powerful national conglomerate controlled by one of the \u2018fat geese\u2019 billionaire, which helped them with appropriate connections in Beijing.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with backing these \u2018fat geese\u2019 businessmen?\u201d, you might ask. Being connected to the right people in power, could even be the most important short-term competitive advantage in a place like China. The problem for a long-term investor is that if we buy shares in this medical diagnostic chain, how do we know whether their success is linked to the way they run their operations, or to their links with local party bosses? What if those local party bosses lose power? If we do not even know what makes them successful, how can then we be sure about the resilience of the business, or how can we value the company for the long-term?\nMore importantly, expropriation is a risk always present in those Emerging Markets that have fragile institutions and low respect for property rights. If a business is built on cronyism and political connections, it is much easier for governments (and political opponents) to bend circumstances to their objectives and go after these businesses. That said, investing alongside corrupt businessmen is not the only way to invite the Emperor\u2019s wrath; the other way is to back companies which lack social purpose.\nProfit at all costs\nThe market for private tuition in China grew at 11% CAGR between 2015-2020, with leading players such as New Oriental (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) experiencing 25-30% top line growth during this period. These companies appeared to have fantastic business models, earning high gross profit margins (55-60%) and high returns on equity (30%+), with their shares very highly rated (PEs of 60x). For someone analysing these companies with the lens of a traditional investment analyst, these were great compounding-type businesses to be held for the long-term.\nBut were these companies serving a social purpose? Were they solving a problem for the community around them or creating a problem themselves? The fantastic profit margins they reported were perhaps the other side of the significant costs they imposed on the parents and students, which went unaccounted for in traditional financial models.\nIn China, millions of students compete every year for just a few thousand seats in prestigious top colleges. This success is based on a single entrance exam, meaning parents and students are naturally very anxious to do their best preparing for this exam. After-school private tuition companies, through aggressive marketing, succeeded in turning this anxiety into a nationwide \u2018Fear of Missing Out\u2019, where parents felt compelled to enrol their children to their programs, even though they could barely afford the fees. As per some estimates, Chinese urban households spend close to 25% of their income on private education services4; and almost 75% of children in urban China are enrolled into private tutoring of some kind. There is very little evidence that these courses raised the education level for children, as they are often run by mediocre tutors and focused on making students cram for exams. These companies not only raised the cost of parenting for everyone in urban China, without any material benefit; they also imposed more pressure on an entire generation of Chinese children.\nIn this context, it should not come as a surprise that the Chinese government decided to act against the entire sector. Companies that pursue profit at the expense of the local community risk losing their social licence to operate. When they do, the results are disastrous for the business and shareholder returns. Especially in an autocratic state such as China, the rulers are extra sensitive to any potential criticism from powerful interest groups such as the urban middle class. Serving a social purpose and creating goodwill in the local community becomes critical to the long-term survival of the business.\nAikya\u2019s Investment Approach\nChina usually evokes extreme behaviour from investors. One set of investors, who are overly focused on near term financial metrics, tend to ignore some of the risks highlighted above and are happy to buy Chinese companies regardless of who owns them or whether they serve a social purpose. Another set of investors usually get put off by governance risks, a general lack of Western-style institutions, and the lack of easy access to trustworthy information; they simply stay away from investing in the country.\nWe believe that a more nuanced approach is needed. The team at Aikya has spent the last 20 years researching China and have collectively analysed close to 1,000 Chinese companies. We are highly sensitive to some of the risks highlighted above and therefore very selective in the companies we choose to back. We have rejected almost 97 companies out of every 100 companies that we have analysed in China. But we equally appreciate the entrepreneurialism and breadth of the market and hence have been able to select 26 Chinese companies to our investable Quality List. These 26 companies are run by some of the best stewards of capital in the world and are well positioned to benefit from the unprecedented consumption growth China is currently undergoing.\nSo, what type of companies do we like?\nWe like companies with strong principal owners. These are the people with \u2018soul-in-the-game\u2019 who are emotionally invested in their companies. A permanent owner-mindset enables these entrepreneurs to make decisions which are likely to strengthen the business in the long-run, without falling for either short termism or not caring about returns on capital at all, which is so common with companies with state-owned or ownerless corporations.\nWe avoid \u2018fat geese\u2019 businessmen. Our starting point is to understand the original source of wealth of the entrepreneur or business family that we are investigating alongside. How did they get their initial success? Is it a clean story, or did they need the help of government or politicians at any point? We always explore the inner mechanisms of a business model to try to understand if there is any government influence either through positive regulations or favourable operating licenses. We then assess if these regulations are transparent and fair, or if they favour a certain set of players?\nWe usually avoid companies where the government or government-owned entities are the primary customers and look at how much of the goods and services produced by a business are directly sold to the government, or at least sold through a government tender. Because of these reasons, we have hardly any companies on our Quality List which operate in Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Telecom, Materials and Energy sectors in China, as these sectors see high levels of government involvement.\nIn a country, where media is not free and information is not easy to obtain, uncovering political linkages and the real shareholder structures of small relatively less known Chinese companies is not easy. It requires patient due diligence, a contextual understanding of how things work in China, and a strong set of trusted relationships on the ground.\nAll the companies on Aikya\u2019s Quality List display high levels of social stewardship, which essentially means they pay fair taxes, do not cut corners in the way they treat employees, and generally behave well towards the community they operate within. Such exemplary behaviour gives little opportunity for politicians to start interfering with a business.\nOur purpose is to generate healthy long-term returns with strong downside protection. Years of experience investing in Emerging Markets have taught us that ensuring \u2018return of capital\u2019 is almost as important as pursuing \u2018return on capital\u2019. As a result, our investment approach has evolved to mitigate the risks which could result in our investee companies ending up as Emperor\u2019s foie gras.",

        "selftext": " The **Semiconductor Sector** has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing.  \nIn the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned.\n\n**If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions.**\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video](https://preview.redd.it/avit8vg2dgr71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a7f6bd2f815eaffa877381a845b1f0061e66ccb)\n\n#  Nvidia ~ $NVDA\n\n&gt;\"Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today\" - Wells Fargo analyst\n\nNvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021.\n\n# Q2 Earnings\n\nAlmost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue \u2014 all those RTX 30 series graphics cards \u2014 hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.\n\n# Crypto Market dependence\n\nWhen of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company\u2019s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.\n\nFor Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**\n\n# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment\n\nNVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates\u00a0that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. \n\n# Arm Deal\n\nNvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD\n\nAMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record\u00a050% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech](https://preview.redd.it/faswa7u5dgr71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fdf6382da174aa1c34fff4ffb72dab7abaa7f2)\n\n#  Q2 Earnings And Growth\n\nOn July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform \"Steam\" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded\u00a030%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.\n\n[ AMD website - q2 Financial results](https://preview.redd.it/jjeh28b8dgr71.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1194ec52ebd44ff97c9ae9686ff69f63d4787d4b)\n\n#  Video Games Potential Growth\n\nVideo game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from\u00a0last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected\u00a0to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected\u00a0to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.\n\n**AMD** supplies\u00a0semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell\u00a025.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.\n\n# Xilinx Acquisition\n\nAMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx\u00a0is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.\n\n# Intel ~ $INTC\n\nIntel\u2019s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It\u2019s struggled with R&amp;D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.\n\nIntel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)\n\n#  New CEO = New Future?\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations",

        "selftext": "AMDs stock has been a hot commodity these last few months with great earnings, even better guidance, and a strong likelihood that their acquisition of Xilinx will be completed by the end of the calendar year. So why should you sell AMD short? I'll tell you why:\n\n* The acquisition deal states that Xilinx shareholders will receive 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share they own. At close today AMD's shareprice was 116.33 and Xilinx was at 170.24. In order for the share prices to be effectively equal at the time of acquisition AMDs shareprice would have to drop to 98.78, or a bit more than 15% lower than the current share price.\n\n* Most shareholders are assuming the acquisition will be successful, and the anticipation of the merger's completion is artifically inflating the stock despite the fact the merger will have no immediate financial gain, especially since short sellers have been unable to properly arbitrate AMD/XLNX shares.\n\n* The chip shortage is not ending soon. It seems like every time I look it is expected to end later than before. Last estimate I heard was June. That's a long time for AMDs sales to remain below what they have the potential to be.\n\n* Finally and most importantly, you should sell AMD short because recent stocks have been doing the opposite of what WSB sentiment and positions currently are, and if you retards help AMD to rocket then that would really help my calls.\n\nPositions: 3 11/19 100C, 2 6/17/22 90C",

        "selftext": "There has been a lot of developments in [$AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices stock](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-Stock-Investment-Update-and-Earnings-Prediction), since I last covered them on June 21st. My previous coverage was my initial coverage of their company, and gives an outline of their whole company, financials, and other important information, which can be found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-is-a-fantastic-investment-idea). However, this analysis is not going to repeat this, rather it is designed to update you with recent news, events, and SEC filings to stay up to date on AMD\u2019s stock.\n\n**SEC Filings:**\n\nRecently, there have only been 2 noteworthy SEC filings, which are:\n\n*Current Report (8-K):*\n\nOn October 26, 2020. AMD entered into a merger plan with Xilinx Inc., making Xilinx a subsidiary of AMD. This merger proposal was officially passed by the UK Competition and Markets Authority on June 29th, making Xilinx an official subsidiary of AMD.\n\n*Quarterly Report (10-Q):*\n\nOn July 27th 2021, AMD released their Q2 2021 financial results. Overall AMD beat their earnings estimates by over 16%, and they raised their guidance. Both of these factors are bullish and assisted in AMD closing 7.5% higher on the trading day following this earnings release.\n\nThe most important factors from this report were that AMD increased revenues 100% YoY (12% QoQ), increased their gross margin by 4 percentage points YoY (2 percentage points QoQ), had a massive increase in their operating incomes and net incomes both YoY and QoQ, and lastly, they announces a $4B share repurchase program.\n\n**Recent News:**\n\n*Windows 11 Updates:*\n\nRecently, Windows 11 has released an update which has slowed the performance of AMD\u2019s CPU\u2019s. AMD is looking into their slower performance with this update and said that they are aiming to fix this problem by the end of the month (October 31st 2021). However, if these problems persist, many people may switch over to another brand of CPU\u2019s (ie. Intel). This will not only cost AMD revenues, but it will be giving those revenues to AMD\u2019s direct competitors.\n\n*AMD Stock Performance:*\n\nOverall, AMD has performed very well since my coverage and is up nearly 50% since my post. There have been a lot of catalysts over this time frame that have led AMD to have sustained such large growth over the past 4 months. Firstly, AMD beat earnings and raised their guidance, which immediately boosted the stock 7.5%. Furthermore, AMD has gained partnerships with elite companies including Tesla and Google.\n\nQ3 2021 Earnings:\n\nAMD is reporting their earnings today (October 26, 2021) after market close. This is sure to be a catalyst for movement in their stock. In the next section I will give my earnings estimate and how I would play it.\n\n**Earnings Estimate:**\n\nI am trying to get this out quickly, so I do not have time to take you through my reasoning for my earnings predictions.\n\n*Revenues:*\n\nI think that AMD will report quarterly revenues of $4.4B, which is 7% higher than AMD guidance suggested, and 7% higher than the average analyst earnings estimate of $4.12B. I think that the growth in their revenues will be the cause of a large growth in their data center revenues.\n\n*EPS:*\n\nI believe that AMD\u2019s EPS (based on my revenue projection) will be $0.72/share, which would indicate an earnings beat of 7.5%.\n\nOverall, I think that AMD is going to beat earnings, but by a relatively small margin. However, it is difficult to predict how the market will react to this. As a result of this, I am taking a more neutral and safe approach through a bull call spread of 126/132. This would cap your losses at $174/bull call spread, and yield a max gain of $426/bull-call spread.",

        "selftext": "This is a warning, I am no expert on the stocks. I am drunk and the wife sent me to the couch tonight so why not dabble in some random dd and speculate earnings on AMD  with some hosers like myself.  I am gonna add my 2 cents on AMD. Please keep in mind that I again am not an expert and I have lost money in the best bull\nmarket in history. I am degenerate who has been playing weekly\u2019s on AMD so please let me know your thoughts. I am bullish on AMD. Since last week I gave it an 8% run up till earrings that was on the 12th opened at $104, and we have passed $113 already. Predictions are that AMD will run till earnings dip and then run again. My reasons are as follows. \n1.) TSLA earnings on 10/20, AMD chips are used in production of Model S and Model X, TSLA\u2019s record number of sales in China  is a good indicator, musk tweets about AMD being good to work with on 09/21. I think Elon fucks. Sales of those two models are important as shit could that be another market share for AMD? \n2.) APPL cucked INTC today with their new chip. \n3.)Still waiting more info on the XILINX deal, 4.)TSM beat expectations\n5.)INTC earnings on 10/21 expecting another move on AMD in anticipation of their earnings regardless of the results.\n6.)Also need to consider the recent partnerships with Microsoft and Google.\n\nHas it all been priced in? I am not sure we have ran over 8% since last week and had a major pop from the new graphics card. I am no expert and I don\u2019t have enough time to dive into the rabbit hole of semi conductors. This is just speculation and not a reliable source of information but I feel like there are plenty more gains to be had.",

        "selftext": "Stocks continued their remarkable rally, with all three major indexes rising and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high amid continued strength by mega-cap tech stocks during earnings. This is despite new economic data that showed US GDP slowdown to its slowest expansion rate in over a year and new weekly unemployment claims. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the major indexes on the day. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest the ongoing corporate earning season.\n\nThe GDP report showed the economy decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike.

        "selftext": "There has been a lot of developments in [$AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices stock](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-Stock-Investment-Update-and-Earnings-Prediction), since I last covered them on June 21st. My previous coverage was my initial coverage of their company, and gives an outline of their whole company, financials, and other important information, which can be found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-is-a-fantastic-investment-idea). However, this analysis is not going to repeat this, rather it is designed to update you with recent news, events, and SEC filings to stay up to date on AMD\u2019s stock.\n\n**SEC Filings:**\n\nRecently, there have only been 2 noteworthy SEC filings, which are:\n\n*Current Report (8-K):*\n\nOn October 26, 2020. AMD entered into a merger plan with Xilinx Inc. to make Xilinx a subsidiary of AMD. This merger proposal was officially passed by the UK Competition and Markets Authority on June 29th, making Xilinx an official subsidiary of AMD.\n\n*Quarterly Report (10-Q):*\n\nOn July 27th 2021, AMD released their Q2 2021 financial results. Overall AMD beat their earnings estimates by over 16%, and they raised their guidance. Both of these factors are bullish and assisted in AMD closing 7.5% higher on the trading day following this earnings release. \n\nThe most important factors from this report were that AMD increased revenues 100% YoY (12% QoQ), increased their gross margin by 4 percentage points YoY (2 percentage points QoQ), had a massive increase in their operating incomes and net incomes both YoY and QoQ, and lastly, they announces a $4B share repurchase program.\n\n**Recent News:**\n\n*Windows 11 Updates:*\n\nRecently, Windows 11 has released an update which has slowed the performance of AMD\u2019s CPU\u2019s. AMD is looking into their slower performance with this update and said that they are aiming to fix this problem by the end of the month (October 31st 2021). However, if these problems persist, many people may switch over to another brand of CPU\u2019s (ie. Intel). This will not only cost AMD revenues, but it will be giving those revenues to AMD\u2019s direct competitors.\n\n*AMD Stock Performance:*\n\nOverall, AMD has performed very well since my coverage and is up nearly 50% since my post. There have been a lot of catalysts over this time frame that have led AMD to have sustained such large growth over the past 4 months. Firstly, AMD beat earnings and raised their guidance, which immediately boosted the stock 7.5%. Furthermore, AMD has gained partnerships with elite companies including Tesla and Google.\n\nQ3 2021 Earnings:\n\nAMD is reporting their earnings today (October 26, 2021) after market close. This is sure to be a catalyst for movement in their stock. In the next section I will give my earnings estimate and how I would play it.\n\n**Earnings Estimate:**\n\nI am trying to get this out quickly, so I do not have time to take you through my reasoning for my earnings predictions.\n\n*Revenues:*\n\nI think that AMD will report quarterly revenues of $4.4B, which is 7% higher than AMD guidance suggested, and 7% higher than the average analyst earnings estimate of $4.12B. I think that the growth in their revenues will be the cause of a large growth in their data center revenues.\n\n*EPS:*\n\nI believe that AMD\u2019s EPS (based on my revenue projection) will be $0.72/share, which would indicate an earnings beat of 7.5%.\n\nOverall, I think that AMD is going to beat earnings, but by a relatively small margin. However, it is difficult to predict how the market will react to this. As a result of this, I am taking a more neutral and safe approach through a bull call spread of 126/132. This would cap your losses at $174/bull call spread, and yield a max gain of $426/bull-call spread.",

        "selftext": "Stocks continued their remarkable rally, with all three major indexes rising and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high amid continued strength by mega-cap tech stocks during earnings. This is despite new economic data that showed US GDP slowdown to its slowest expansion rate in over a year and new weekly unemployment claims. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the major indexes on the day. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest the ongoing corporate earning season.\n\nThe GDP report showed the economy decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike. Cases in the US retreated from a high in the previous spike of 285,058 to 105,561 in between September 13 and October 25. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September.
