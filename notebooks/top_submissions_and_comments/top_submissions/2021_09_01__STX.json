        "selftext": " \n\nThis is why I believe Seagate's earning will suffer on going forward basis and it is because of collapse of \"investment product that shall not be named\" price.\n\nIn May 2021, \"investment product that shall not be named\" was launched with little fanfare, but not in tech community where it led to shortage of both SSD and HDD in the market, resulting in both increase of demand and increase of pricing.\n\nWell... After few months of excitements, there has been gradual deflation of price of \"investment product that shall not be named\" where now price is range bound around $200 and netspace of \"investment product that shall not be named\" is stabilizing. This implies artificial spike in demand of both SSD and HDD have disappeared, which will eventually impact Seagate's earnings.\n\nIf I was part of Seagate management, I would start purchasing \"investment product that shall not be named\" to inflate the price to keep this gravy train longer, but I digress.\n\nI have excluded Western Digital from this posting because their ongoing merger with Kioxia.",
