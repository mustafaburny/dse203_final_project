        "selftext": "I\u2019ve made and continue to make mistakes trading options, but every mistake makes me better and helps ensure I take a step back and don\u2019t get complacent. I\u2019ve committed to posting regularly to save others the pain of losing if I can and to help cement what I\u2019ve learned in my own head. I hope this post helps. It\u2019s not at all meant to show off, as I\u2019ve traded sideways in this IRA account for several months now, but recently changed strategies and they are working despite a little pull backs the past couple days. \n\n**Buying &amp; Selling Pfizer**\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of headlines about Pfizer lately, most of it very good news. So it\u2019s not surprising that the stock has been moving up. But it\u2019s wildly undervalued in my opinion. Prior to Covid, the stock was trading around $38 per share with about 50B in revenue. Last quarter alone they did $24B in revenue with sales boosted by the vaccine sales. Not only will this revenue trend continue, but they will be adding capacity to sell 21 million doses of the Covid-19 oral therapy next year at $700 a dose. That\u2019s another $15B of revenue. \n\nThe naysayers think these sales figures are short-lived or will wane quickly with the virus, but to this I say two things: first, it doesn\u2019t matter, money is money. Second, they are not accounting for the fact that 90 governments have already stepped forward to begin purchasing and stockpiling these pills to avoid the sort of supply chain issues everyone was having when the vaccines first appeared. So even if no one takes the pills, they will be purchased and stored. The U.S. has already ordered \u201cmillions\u201d of the anti-viral pills. \n\nPfizer expects vaccine sales of 36B in 2021 and 29B in 2022. Add to that the anti-viral pills and they are going to be hitting $44B in covid drugs next year - that\u2019s the entire revenue of previous years and does not count any sales from their other products. Now, they do share revenue with BioNTech, so we need to discount the vaccine sales by half, but that still equates to almost $30B more revenue next year.\n\nTo the naysayers that argue this revenue is short-lived: we don\u2019t yet know that is true as this virus has proven to be tricky and it\u2019s likely the covid shot is the new annual flu shot, as was the case with swine flu. More importantly, the profit from these drugs will fuel a major acquisition spree. They can go buy their next blockbusters without R&amp;D risk.\n\nSo what am I doing about all this? I bought 30 Jan23 options contracts $40 strike when Pfizer dipped last month. I sold 10 last week for a 100% gain. I\u2019m going to ride the remaining 20 up to a price target of $65 a share. I will pick up more on any major selloffs. \n\n**I Loaded Up on CROX**\n\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about this stock, which I have been trading for a couple years now because I don\u2019t like holding through the volatility. The short version is, they are absolutely killing it and despite initial concerns about potential knock offs and rubber shortages, people continue to stay brand loyal and buy them up. When you walk down the street and see half the kids wearing them, you know they have done something amazing with their brand. And they financials show it: \n\n425% earnings growth\n\n73% revenue growth\n\n65% gross margin (incredible)\n\nP/E of 15\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to find bargains in this market, but when CROX pulled back in October, I bought some 2023 calls when the price rose above 140 (because I could tell the momentum was under it then). It\u2019s hanging around 174 right now and normally I would have exited but because of my past trades of getting out a little early, I sold my original investment and am going to hang on to the rest until the stock crosses 200.  \n\n**I Bought On QualComm\u2019s Buyback**\n\nOn Oct 12th, I got an alert from my favorite new system, LevelFields, that QualComm would be buying back $10B worth of stock aka 7% of the company at the time. IMHO there is no stronger signal to the market of a company\u2019s financial health than a buyback. It means, typically, that the leadership is so confident in the market position, sales, cash flow, and economic environment that they\u2019d rather repurchase stock than spend more money to grow revenues or save for a rainy day. \n\nWhen the buyback occurs before earnings are out, it\u2019s a good sign it\u2019s going to be a blockbuster earnings report. When the news hit, the stock was trading at 122/share. Sure enough, when earnings came out in November, they crushed it. Record revenue, beat earnings consensus by 13% ($2.55/share), and upped guidance revenue going forward. \n\nI bought the Jan 2023 calls at a 140 strike price and intend to hold them until the stock reaches 200. \n\nThe stock hit 170 recently and had a bit of a pullback on what appears to be profit taking and inflation worries.\n\nThere\u2019s some volatility ahead but I will hold through the chop this time because the company is on the right path and the analysts are all calling for 185-204 ranges. \n\n**I Bought and Sold Puts on Pullbacks** \n\nA strategy I\u2019ve grown to love is selling puts towards the end of a pullback on stocks I want to own. I did this for Visa after its earnings sell-off at the end of October. Now, I have owned Visa since its IPO and the position has grown quite large over time so I\u2019ve been trimming it over the years and now look for ways to profit from trading it. Headed into earnings, I suspected a good chance of a pullback and got ready to sell the dip. \n\nAs expected, it sold off, got hit with a government antitrust investigation, and tumbled some more. On the government investigation news, I sold puts on it when it had fallen 10% down to the 210 level and raked in the premiums. \n\nI like using Fidelity\u2019s options analyzer to help ensure the puts I\u2019m selling fall outside at least one standard deviation from expected price movements. It\u2019s one of the more helpful ways of visualizing where to aim.\n\nI also bought puts on Visa prior to earnings at the money for one week out with an order to sell once I hit a $10,000 profit. It sold off in a few hours and I got the Fidelity notification I had just made $10,000 in a day while making lunch. \n\nThere are some more trades I made, but I\u2019m out of time for writing today so hopefully can come back to those another time (UPST, INMD, UCTT, CELH).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[25&amp;#37; in cash, 75&amp;#37; invested in this account for effective return of 36&amp;#37; until the recent pullback](https://preview.redd.it/tn38hd19nyy71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12693a0d345ce0838452cfb8f0e7f5ba893a8af5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xen04fvhnyy71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb6614d4f6e2a30e69f53e81f09cd6242683c6d",

        "selftext": "**NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. EVERY INVESTMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH RISKS. DON'T BE AN IDIOT AND TAKE MY WORDS AS SCRIPTURES.** \n\nFellow retards, I posted about [$BBBY Shorts were caught with their pants down???](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlek68/bbby_shorts_were_caught_with_their_pants_down/) on November 02 and $BBBY went from $16 to $35 in AH . Sadly, $BBBY went back to $18 five days ago, and a lot of retards were caught holding bags at $30 ++. Well.. here is some good news for you. I DO NOT THINK THIS IS OVER. \n\nGuess who bought the fucking dips? \n\n**EVP, CFO of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc** ([30-Year Financial](https://www.gurufocus.com/financials/BBBY), [Insider Trades](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/BBBY/insider)) [Gustavo Arnal](https://www.gurufocus.com/insider/Arnal+Gustavo/name) ([insider trades](https://www.gurufocus.com/insider/Arnal+Gustavo/name)) bought **12,500 shares of BBBY** on 11/08/2021 at an average price of $**20.44 a share**. The total cost of this purchase was $255,500. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**John Fleming**, at **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond** (NASDAQ:[BBBY](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BBBY#NASDAQ)), made a large insider buy on November 5, according to a new SEC filing.\n\n**What Happened:** A Form 4 filing from the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000114036121037282/xslF345X03/form4.xml) on Friday showed that **Fleming purchased 15,000 shares** of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond at at a price of **$19.00**. The total transaction amounted to $285,000.\n\n[Fleming](https://benzinga.com/sec/insider-trades/bbby/john-fleming) now owns a total of 51,587 of **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond** worth, 1,107,314.\n\nWell..... Who the fuck is John Fleming?\n\nJohn E. Fleming is on the board of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Inc. and 6 other companies. In his past career he was Chief Merchandising Officer &amp; Executive VP at Walmart, Inc., Group Executive Officer &amp; CEO-Global eCommerce at FAST RETAILING CO., LTD. and Chief Executive Officer-Global eCommerce at Uniqlo Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of FAST RETAILING CO., LTD.), Senior Vice President-Merchandising at Target Corp. and Chief Marketing Officer at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n\nYou read that right, Mr. Fleming is not an autist like you and I. A**n insider buying up 15,000 shares at $19.00** when the stock spiked from $14.00 to $30++. He could have just waited for it to dip back to $14 but he didn't. He bought them shares like a degenerate that he is. Why? Because he knows SHORTS are fucked too. Their pants are still down.  Or do we want to talk about the **CFO bought 12,500 shares at $20.44????** \n\nLook at this fucking chart. Do you see a familiar pattern here ? I believe we are still in the early stage of the squeeze. Yes, you heard that fucking right. \n\n\" ***High Short Interest***: Of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s 45.5 million share float, 26.81 million shares, meaning about 58.93%, are held short. The number has increased from 22.04 million in September. \"\n\n[Analysis ](https://preview.redd.it/ptzd35q0aty71.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d6606ee3c04745b107dca01dcf2277bdb9d5af3)\n\nI am coming up with a third DD to show you retards that Shorts were shorting this stock at $14, thinking it that it will go below $10. What happened when the price went  to $30? Shorts went panic, but they doubled down. FOMO and insiders pumped the stock price to $30. A lot of bag holders saw a glimpse of heaven and they sold, tanking the price back to $18. Well, I believe shorts will cover soon, which will definitely send the price higher than $30. \n\nYou can find my [Position](https://preview.redd.it/it0ioj5529x71.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67f17ad971b39bcedc989c999edf89726fcf15f) in the old post: [BBBY](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlek68/bbby_shorts_were_caught_with_their_pants_down/)\n\nFinally, here's what Citron Research said about BBBY. They clearly learned their lesson getting fucked by $GME back in those days and decide to switch side. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\"On November 2, $BBBY announced that it was accelerating its $1 billion three-year share repurchase program to now be completed by the end of fiscal 2021.\u00a0 The last time we saw a buyback this aggressive and bullish was from Citron favorite RH when the co. announced a $700 million buyback authorization in May 2017 when the stock was trading at $52.\u00a0 Two months later, RH completed the buyback and you know the rest of the story. (RH is at**  $ 636.69  today) \n\nThere are clear parallels from this aggressive move by $BBBY with $RH four years ago.\n\n1. Management and the BOD believe the stock is highly undervalued\n2. This aggressive buyback shows there are no liquidity concerns\n3. The shareholder structure is more concentrated than the market appreciates (e.g., 42% of $BBBY shares outstanding are held by the top 3 holders BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard)\n\n**Analysts and investors can see in the latest $BBBY 10-Q filing that the company has completed the initial $600 million tranche of this buyback at an average price of $25 while repurchasing stock in tranches as high as $29 (i.e., 50% higher).**\u00a0\n\nNo one knows the intrinsic value of this company more than this board\u2026 same $RH argument and they believe the stock is undervalued even at $29.\n\nApplying a 5x EBITDA multiple on 2024 EBITDA of $800 million to $1 billion **we arrive at a price target of $50 to $70,** so can see why management sees value here.\"\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk, one last paragraph about why BBBY is still undervalued.\n\nHere is what Miller Value Partners has to say about Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\n\n&gt;*\"Our largest laggard during the quarter was Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY). As we have highlighted previously, not all transformations are linear and there is always the potential for a short-term pullback in executing the plan. We expect the operational pause will lead to marketplace skepticism and question the success of the long-term plan. The company has had some near-term challenges from weaker store traffic related to Covid-19 delta variant\u2019s impact along with rising supply chain and transportation costs. However, we disagree with the marketplace view that these headwinds will continue to overwhelm the significant ongoing improvements that management is making to the core operations. We very much like the new CEO and his additions to his management team \u2013 strong executives with significant transformation experience. As the new initiatives further rollout over the coming quarters, we expect to see further improvement in future operating trends. Management is in the process of rolling out 8-10 owned brands, which should drive margin expansion and dramatically enhance the overall business model. Store brands are 1,000 basis points higher gross margin than national brands, and as they move from 10% to 30% of sales, they should become a significant positive profit contributor and help management achieve their long-term gross margin target of 38%. Bed Bath also continues to have a very strong balance sheet ($10/share in cash), and has been using non-core asset sales to complete a very accretive share buyback program (likely greater than 20% of the float by year-end). With the recent pullback, we see some similarities to GameStop early in their turnaround as the company aggressively reduced their shares outstanding (&gt;30%) ahead of revenue stability and profit improvement. We believe success on Bed Bath\u2019s transformation plan should see profits double over the next couple of years and should lead to significantly higher normalized earnings and free cash flow per share. At an enterprise value to revenue under .2x,* ***we believe Bed Bath remains at a significant discount to its intrinsic value.\"***",

Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. Management\n\nAs part of Paysafe\u2019s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they\u2019ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They\u2019ve hired PayPal\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook\u2019s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl\u2019s Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.\n\nStill, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe\u2019s value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader\u2019s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.\n\nRegardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution.

William Hill)\n\nAll that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada\u2019s [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeding the future growth right now\u2026 The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective\u2026It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\u201d  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.\n\nLastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.\n\nThe types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe\u2019s \u201cvalue creation playbook\u201d which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), \u201cthose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s worth underscoring Foley\u2019s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He\u2019s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, \u201cMy whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.\u201d  Though he\u2019s not Paysafe\u2019s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that \u201c  Bill is highly engaged with the company.\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. Lockup Expiration\n\nSome bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe\u2019s value creation playbook. Between Foley\u2019s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone\u2019s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.\n\nUpon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified \u201cbase returns for a four year hold period\u201d of \u201c2.9x to 3.8x\u201d from $10.  \n\nFrom their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): \u201cThe Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. Valuation\n\nPaysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.\n\nNow trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner\u2019s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.\n\nOr maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a \"300% higher\" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of \u201c$3.7 billion\u201d, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.\n\nInitially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE\u2019s financial data, like YF\u2019s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  It\u2019s not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.\n\nObviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.\n\nTrue price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil then, here are a few reference points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment as a separate company:\n\nThe eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.\n\nAdyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen\u2019s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe\u2019s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That\u2019s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.\n\nUsing Adyen\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company\u2019s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.\n\nAgain, that represents less than a third of Paysafe\u2019s total business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing\n\nPaysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.\n\nFor 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. \n\nIn all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDigital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet\n\nMany compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here\u2019s a deeper look into that comparison:\n\nAs noted earlier, Paysafe\u2019s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.\n\nBy comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal\u2019s troubles as a \u201cbuying opportunity.\u201d\n\nSome will reasonably say that\u2019s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal\u2019s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).\n\nPaysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020\u2019s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe\u2019s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal\u2019s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.\n\nPaysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a \u201cfree cash flow machine,\u201d Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).\n\nThere\u2019s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL\u2019s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE\u2019s potential acquisition debt and dilution:\n\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90\n* PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75\n* PayPal\u2019s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41\n\nThose metrics average to a share price of $27.31\n\nWhen factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSector multiples:\n\nBecause Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \\~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.\n\nAfter removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here\u2019s Paysafe\u2019s share price with the averaged peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67\n* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17\n* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72\n\nAverage : $41.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS\u2019s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE\u2019s recent price action, but certainly not all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, \u201cthe market doesn\u2019t care,\u201d but I\u2019m confident that\u2019ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER\u2019s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of \u201clook at the chart\u201d and \u201cprice is truth.\u201d  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.\n\nNo, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, \u201cThe stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.\u201d\n\nDo with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.  Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I\u2019d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",

I\u2019ve only been trading SPACs for the past month after the whole DWAC thing and stumbled upon this sub and instantly was hooked. I bought a couple different warrants and commons (SABS, GGPI, PIPP, DCGO, CND). I\u2019m confused on how to sell the warrants. I understand you can sell them at any time but I\u2019m curious on what happens when you hold the warrants and the SPAC goes into IPO status. It looks like the good play is to hold the warrants and exercise them at a certain point. That\u2019s where my brain isn\u2019t connecting the dots.\n\nOnce a SPAC does the merger and goes IPO, what happens to the warrants? Do I have to sell them like a normal stock or does it automatically make the switch itself into a common? Or do I have to manually exercise the warrants and that\u2019s when it converts? I\u2019ve seen different articles talk about a different ratios of warrants equaling a common (3 warrants converts into 1 common) but I\u2019m still confused on whether I have to do it myself or it does it automatically. I\u2019m on fidelity app if that helps any. \n\nAlso, is it best to sell warrants pre IPO or post? Or does it just depend on how well the warrant is doing at the current time?\n\nCurrently on a road trip with the family so I have plenty of time for open discussion and whatever help can be thrown my way.",

I'm not sure if these are held in a SPV where the sponsor determines when and what level to sell - but I'd bet they aren't going to paper hand $SEAT.\n   * Filing here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001856031/000119312521321753/d221886ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001856031/000119312521321753/d221886ds1.htm)\n* Bottom line - I don't think we'll see much selling pressure when the S-1 registering the PIPE goes effective in the next few weeks.\n* If you look at $SEAT Q1 and Q2 performance, you'll know why the sponsor did most of the PIPE. \n* In April 2021, Vivid projected 2021E Revenue and EBITDA at $168M and $7M. \n* Since then, their 1H 2021 results have pretty much crushed the expected full year 2021 expectations!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0nh2k5zt5my71.png?width=1717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae42103e6592652a20a4610bd2742d49afecdd40\n\n* Research analysts now expects 2021E Revenue and EBITDA of $400M and $91M, up +138% and +1,204% from what management projected in April!\n* $SEAT unlike SeatGeek (RBAC), is highly profitable now and will continue to experience expanding operating leverage as revenue increases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye4cnpl86my71.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5dbc592bed7c3a733a6ed76a1a89f43d440032\n\n* If you utilize $LYV 2023E EBITDA multiple, you can justify a $SEAT per share price of $17 at the low end and up to $20 if you believe street estimates are likely going to go higher when $SEAT reports earnings on 11/15 before the market opens.\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnktxd5h6my71.png?width=1114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f06ba85b2d12a3727285fd80746c03fad6975a4\n\n* Street analysts also agree with my valuation framework. Price Targets range from $16 to $23. DA Davidson which is not included in the lineup below has a $23 PT.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/od94ntsr6my71.png?width=457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18eaae4ccb664197ba401ec692b75ccc114615fa\n\n* In closing, I think $SEAT is a very compelling opportunity with fair value likely in the $17-20 area that shouldn't face selling pressure (if any) from PIPE going effective in a few weeks.

        "selftext": " \n\nLet's start at the beginning, GRAB is a multibillion-dollar food delivery/courier/shipping/grocery delivery service that has total control of the southeast Asian market. It has been flexible and adaptive to COVID and the ever-changing markets that ensue. It has driven out competitors like uber to reign supreme and it's well on its way to the US. They posted strong Q3 results today that held up to extremely strict lockdown measures to post record merchandise revenue results. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grab-reports-third-quarter-2021-110000140.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grab-reports-third-quarter-2021-110000140.html))\n\nThey have a strong outlook and are looking to expand into China and move to the US as well. Meanwhile, they have financial backers such as Blackrock, Barclays, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanely and are currently valued at around 40 Billion. They are on track to do a reverse merger with AGC which will have the potential for a short-term play. However, GRAB expects the market to expand from 52 Billion in 2020 to 180 Billion by 2025. When these guys merge it will be the largest SPAC merger EVER. They have already started the process of filling and gaining approval from the SEC. Some people believed today would be the official announcement but there is still time for them to announce it before the end of the year as they have promised. (The merger is confirmed but not announced officially yet.)\n\nThis brings us to AGC, Altimeter Growth Corp is about to be thrust into the spotlight. When AGC and GRAB merge there will be an institutional lockout for THREE years, where institutions own 69.82% of total shares with 50 million outstanding; The short interest is also 38.81%. There is a potential for a short-term play but also strong fundamentals to have this in your long-term portfolio. While talk about this is relatively small AGC just hit a 1 billion market cap today and has been mostly under the radar.\n\nFrom similar plays that I have been exposed to this year like CLOV, GME, and AMC I expect this to run easily to the 25-35 dollar range. I bought 13-14 dollar calls last week and have 350 shares at 15.05. Calls are still relatively cheap for something with this much exposure. Look for a strong run-up to the announcement then a potential short-term play. Happy Hunting Apes.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/agc/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/agc/institutional-holdings)\n\n[https://fintel.io/ss/us/agc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/agc)",

        "selftext": "Fundamentals are growing and strong with $709 million in total commissions and $560 million in net trading income as of 1H21 \u2013 both above their 2020 totals \u2013 and total commissions expected to reach $2.5 billion in 2025. eToro\u2019s total commissions include commissions from trading activity, interest, and other charges. It generates majority of its revenues from trading commissions, which accounted for 87% of total commissions in 1H21. The net trading income is derived directly from total commissions after adjusting for trading cost. \n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, eToro\u2019s total commissions increased tenfold, from $60 million in 2016 to $602 million in 2020, led by the increase in cryptoasset prices and trading volume in 2017 and 2018, the launch of zero commission stocks trading in 2019, and increased retail participation in equities market in 2020. Furthermore, as eToro expands, its proprietary technology, effective marketing activities, and ability to operate globally via a single platform (with adjustments per market), will enable it to grow its total commissions from $1.0 billion in 2021 to $2.5 billion in 2025; while profitability (EBITDA) is expected to jump ~46.6x to $700 million during the same time period.\neToro\u2019s Total Commissions and Adj. EBITDA are Estimated to Near $2.5 Billion and $700 Billion in 2025, Respectively\n\nIn March 2021, eToro announced a definitive business combination agreement with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V (NASDAQ: FTCV) that values the company at ~$9.6 billion (pro forma EV). The transaction includes $250 million in gross proceeds from FinTech V\u2019s cash in trust and $650 million in gross proceeds from a fully committed private placement in public equity (PIPE) at $10.00 per share from various strategic and institutional investors. These include ION Investment Group, Softbank Vision Fund 2, Third Point LLC, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, and Wellington Management, that will close concurrently with the business combination. The company is expected to have ~$800 million net cash on its balance sheet to support future growth. After the transaction, eToro\u2019s existing equity holders, including current investors and employees of the firm, will remain the largest investors in the combined company retaining ~91% ownership. The company is expected to have an estimated implied equity value of ~$10.4 billion at closing. This reflects an implied EV of ~$9.6 billion for eToro, which equates to 9.7x 2022E net revenues of $990 million. This valuation multiple is significantly lower than its high-growth FinTech peers (26.2x), high-growth international brokers (17.0x), and developed tech led brokers (12.0x), making eToro an attractive choice for investors chasing growth at a reasonable valuation. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both eToro and Fintech V, is expected to close in 2021 and the combined entity will be listed on NASDAQ.\n\nSource: Intro-act, eToro Investor Presentation",

        "selftext": "I meant to post this in the robinhood subreddit but I dont have enough karma.\nSo back in April by robinhood account got hacked and $5000 was taken out of my bank account without my permission. Whoever hacked my account decided to buy $5000 worth of options in some random medical company and sell them the same day for a loss. Prior to this I had a little over $200 worth of stock in my account. After I realised my account was hacked I called robinhood and they refunded the $5000 to my bank account, however they put  -$5000 on my robinhood account. The negative balance on my account caused it to get margin called and my $200 worth of stock was sold off without my permission. Months later my account is still negative.  I've called robinhood several times since about removing my negative balance and refunding me for the positions they sold off and they have done nothing. Every time I call someone transfers me to a different person and I get told that they will fix/ look in to the problem  and every time they do nothing. Strangly enough my account was hacked just weeks after transferring everything to fidelity after using rh for several years. Its beyond infuriating. What can I do to get my money back?",

        "selftext": "From WSJ:\n\n\"Americans would no longer be able to use some popular strategies to move money into tax-free Roth individual retirement accounts under a roughly\u00a0$2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package\u00a0House Democrats approved on Friday.\n\nThe bill, passed along partisan lines and expected to be amended by the Senate,\u00a0includes a series of provisions\u00a0Democrats are backing in an effort to prevent the wealthiest Americans from shielding multimillion-dollar retirement accounts from taxes.\n\nThe IRA measures will raise tax revenue to help pay for items such as universal prekindergarten and\u00a0lower prescription drug prices. But the impact of eliminating them will go beyond just the wealthy as some people further down the income scale will also be affected.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2022, the legislation would prohibit use of a type of Roth conversion known as the\u00a0mega-backdoor Roth conversion. Regular Roth conversions would still be allowed, although starting in 2032, they would be off-limits for people with higher incomes.\n\nThe mega-backdoor Roth strategy lets participants in 401(k) plans that allow after-tax contributions put as much as $58,000 a year into a 401(k) account and convert a substantial chunk of the money to a tax-free Roth account, potentially with a minimal tax hit.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2022, the bill would also eliminate backdoor Roth conversions of after-tax contributions of as much as $6000 to traditional IRAs, or up to $7000 for those 50 and older. The strategy is often used by single individuals with incomes above $140,000 and married couples making more than $208,000, who aren\u2019t eligible to make Roth IRA contributions.\n\nOne of the more far reaching IRA and 401(k)-related provisions in the bill wouldn\u2019t kick in for another decade. Starting in 2032, the legislation would prevent single people earning more than $400,000 a year and married couples with incomes above $450,000 from converting pretax retirement-account money to Roth accounts.\n\nIn a traditional pretax retirement account, savers generally subtract contributions from their income, reducing taxes. Instead, they pay income tax when they withdraw the money in retirement. In a Roth, owners contribute after-tax money, which grows tax-free and can generally be withdrawn tax-free.\n\nStarting in 2029, the measure would prohibit contributions to IRAs for single people with incomes over $400,000 and married couples making over $450,000, who have aggregate retirement account balances above $10 million.\n\nIt would also require higher income people with aggregate retirement-account balances above $10 million to take distributions, regardless of their age.\n\nHigh-balance retirement accounts came under scrutiny after news site ProPublica reported that business titan Peter Thiel amassed $5 billion tax-free in a Roth IRA.\n\nDemocrats dropped provisions that would have banned holding unregistered securities, including private equity, in IRAs.\n\nThe mega-backdoor strategy rests on a little-known fact about 401(k) plans: The Internal Revenue Service lets employees set aside as much as $58,000 a year in a 401(k) account, a number that rises to $64,500 for those 50 or older. To get to the $58,000 annual limit, a worker can put $19,500\u2014or $26,000 if 50 or older\u2014in either a traditional pretax 401(k) or a Roth 401(k). If the plan allows, the person can also make an after-tax contribution of as much as $38,500.\n\nMany 401(k) plans don\u2019t allow mega-backdoor Roth conversions. But in recent years, a growing number\u00a0have added the feature. It is available at many large companies that employ people with the means to save significant sums, including\u00a0Aon\u00a0PLC,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Inc.,\u00a0and\u00a0AT&amp;T\u00a0Inc.,\u00a0according to the companies.\n\nNearly 20% of the 23,500 401(k) plans administered by Fidelity Investments allow the mega-backdoor strategy. Of the 19.5 million people enrolled in Fidelity-managed 401(k)s, 47% are in plans that offer both after-tax contributions and Roth 401(k) conversions, although far fewer use the combination.\n\nUnder the legislation, employees would still be allowed to make after-tax contributions to 401(k)s. But they would no longer be permitted to convert that money to a Roth, where profits can grow tax-free. Instead, they would pay income tax on their investment gains when they withdraw the money.\"",

        "selftext": "Greetings to all,\n\nI have an above average understanding of business fundamentals and standard investing, but for some reason I\u2019m having an extremely hard time wrapping my head around options. I did read the sub info an watch some videos. I also purchased one recently just to see what would happen. A SNAP call at $59. I watched it lose value until it expired at $0. Usually, I watch and learn and emerge with a general understanding of what I\u2019m doing. In this case, I realized I had no idea at all what happened. \n\nThis brings me to today. I invested a year or so ago in Moderna. I believe in the company long term. The market reaction to the COVID pills was too strong in my opinion and the massive drop last week from high of $350 to a low of $211 was far too much of an over correction. \n\nI think it will return to $300-$310 in the relative near future. The company has orders to easily sustain it through 2022, much increased manufacturing and distribution, and the COVID vaccine was an indicator at just how effective this technology is. I want to buy what I can and hold long, but I also want to try my hand at options to make some gains on the over correction. \n\nAre there tools or graphs online where I can visualize various scenarios? Or is this basically guesswork? \n\nI\u2019m considering 11/12 or 11/19 calls. \n\nWhy would anyone buy an option above the current share price? Lower premium, I understand that. It seems I would only do that if I feel really strongly that the stock will move a significant amount very quickly. \n\nAn option under current stock price will cost me more on the premium, but if it does move up to where I think it should be, I make that extra $10 or $20 per share, minus the increase in premium. But the premium increase at every $5 seems to negate the gain?\n\nI can trade from Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, or Robinhood (which is just easiest for me because I like the UI and I already have some MRNA shares there). \n\nOn RH I can see all sorts of things like IV%, estimated chance at profit, each of the Greeks, etc. But what should I be looking for when determining a price to buy and a date to exercise? For example, \n\nthe 11/12 $230 call at $14.95. I\u2019d need the stock to get to $244.35 to break even, an increase in 6.10%. IV is 97.23% and chance of profit is 37.16%. \n\nThe 11/19 $230 call is $17.58. So I risk losing more for the safety of an extra week. IV is 82.13%, chance of profit is down to 35.62%. I don\u2019t understand the relationship between the IV value and chance to profit. \n\nOr should I shoot further out? Q1 of 2022? Longer?\n\nFinally, do you have to actually sell all 100 shares if you do exercise the option or can you keep some? I don\u2019t understand that part because I\u2019ve never seen a successful option in real life. \n\nI know that was a lot. I\u2019m eager to learn. I really appreciate your assistance or referral to an easy to understand but solid place to finally crack this comprehension barrier.",

Thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sold to open 2 put contacts at a $4.50 strike and Fidelity estimated that I would get $180 in premium. The bid was 0 and the ask was 4.90.

After realizing that the premium was so little and not what I was expecting, I decided that I did not want to lock up my cash for $1.85 in premium.

        "selftext": "So I've been a Charles Schwab user since August of last year, 2020. I've been really thinking about moving to Fidelity for the last few months. I don't know why I don't just move my accounts to Fidelity. Schwab has a good platform (could be better), is a bank, the color blue lol but not a reason, Schwab gives me leniency with trading for the $25k rule and more, and good customer service but so does Fidelity I've heard. Schwab just feels easy and comfortable because I've basically been using them since I've been investing. Throughout this year I've been considering moving to Fidelity because there have been some small things that have happened with StreetSmart Edge and just trading with Schwab in general. I do day trade and also do long-term investing. There have been times where it has taken 10 seconds to a few minutes for my cost basis/ cost per share to pop up on the screen and I have lost out on money and lost money because of this before. I'd put up with it about 6-8 months ago when that happened and hasn't happened since. It happened a few times. I haven't run into that problems since then, mainly because I haven't been placing trades as often as I used to. Something happened last week though with Schwab's desktop trading app and updating market data.\n\nLast week though... this is really what has gotten to me and honestly, when this happened I was really pissed and shocked at what was going. I sort of had no idea what to think. I called customer service after this happened, and they took down what I had to say and looked into it with the tech division or whatever division that handles market matching data. They didn't call me back after I asked them to, it was fixed a few minutes later and didn't happen again. I took a couple of screenshots of my trading screen of SSE alongside by side with Fidelity's Active Trader Pro Trading app. I saved another screenshot along with this one, but deleted the other picture (thankfully I saved at least one screenshot I took) because at the time I was going to post here on Reddit about it, but decided not to at the time because 1) I didn't have time, 2) I thought it would be taken care of (which it was), 3) it was fixed so thought it wasn't an issue anymore and it remains not an issue, and 4) because I was lazy that day/ last week and deferred writing this post until tonight. Since the 4th of November last week I have forgotten about it a little, but has been in the back of my mind since, so I am writing this now. Maybe this was just a small issue/ glitch in the system at the moment and isn't how Schwab runs things on their servers. Possibly this is a stupid post, but I don't think so.\n\nSo onto it.. Last week on November 4th, I had Fidelity's Active Trader Pro and Schwab's SSE programs up to look at the market data because I've noticed all the time that Schwab doesn't print the time and sales for all transactions while Fidelity does. Schwab updates the current bids and asks that are at the top of the ask/ bid table along with the other bids and asks (that match with Fidelity, other than Schwab that does lump together orders for the same price mostly), but then doesn't print all of the sales in premarket and I'm sure for the market times as well. I have direct trading and level 2 data. Sometimes during market hours, I notice this. Maybe I don't have all of the exchanges listed for the printing of sales or something. There will be transactions that Schwab doesn't print that Fidelity prints. So, when I want to sell something I am thinking of the wrong price to sell it at because I am seeing a sell at a certain price and thinking, oh I'll set my limit to this price, even though Schwab is listing the current bid and ask, but the time and sales aren't being listed. So I set my limit to a price near the bid of the last price usually and also look at the bid and it fills and I wonder why my sell is a higher price than what I am seeing for the last time and sales, same with buying. This is because Schwab doesn't list all of the time and sales, so I am not getting all of the current market data to put orders in. I'm sure the sales of my orders go for what the market is going for at the best price since I cannot see all the time and sales on Schwab, and Fidelity shows the price I can see that it's the best price at the time of my order fill.\n\nOkay... back to what I am here to write about. Nov 4th, around 10:15ish AM EST to about 10:19-20ish AM EST, I was looking at Microsoft, MSFT, and Apple, APPL, between SSE and Active Trader Pro. Schwab was showing prices were selling for between $0-2 lower and higher depending on if the candle was green or red, compared to Fidelity. I was timing Fidelity's and Schwab's price action and Schwab was about 20 seconds or so behind in updating what Fidelity was showing, if not more. I manually timed the change in price to Fidelity and that's where I get 20 seconds. This all was happening fast so it was hard to document. I should have screen recorded, but I didn't think of that at the time. In the picture below it shows Fidelity keeping up with the time and sales of the current time and Schwab is 12 minutes behind on the time and sales, but Schwab is only 12 minutes behind on the time part. Schwab was still over a $1 difference than what Fidelity was showing, and this was between $0-$2 difference, the difference fluctuated throughout this 4-5 minute window I was looking at MSFT and AAPL. I only show MSFT here because I only took a screenshot of MSFT. I was looking on the Schwab mobile app, Fidelity's mobile app, and as well as the prices on the internet, Fidelity was showing the right prices. Through these 4-5 minutes, the real price did change $0-2 on Fidelity because of well trading, which was the real price in my eyes. Schwab was behind on the prices.. when AAPL or MSFT was showing green on Fidelity $0-2 change from the opening candle, Schwab was showing red and $0-2 change from its opening candle. Then the opposite was for a red candle on Fidelity.. Schwab was showing a green candle and $0-2 change. It was more towards $1.50 change, there was $2 difference I could see, but not a lot of trades during this time so roughly $1-1.50 was noticeable, but there were trades $2 apart I saw. Schwab's software seems to not be the greatest, or at least just a massive lag during this time. I wish I just recorded my screen because it would have been much better to express what was going on. I loaded up the \"Snipping Tool\" and chose a \"2 second time delay\" for the snipping tool to freeze the screen so I could refresh all of the time and sales window total history for Fidelity before the screen froze. Fidelity's time and sale tape are also visible, I just thought it would be good to have the time and total history sales up as well.\n\nAs you can see in the photo below on the right is StreetSmart Edge and on the left is Active Trader Pro. The current time was 9:18 AM CST time for me, so 10:18 AM EST trading time. Schwab is displaying time and sales at 10:06 AM EST while Fidelity is showing 10:18 AM EST which was the current time. Fidelity shows MSFT at the last trade price of roughly $335.22, while Schwab is showing a price of $334.055, while the bid was at $334.04 and ask at $334.06 for Schwab. Fidelity was also showing a bid and ask price around what the real price was going for which was roughly $335.22 at the time. I whited out too much info for the Fidelity side by accident because my account number was showing and I was planning on keeping extra copies of my screenshot but that didn't happen, so this is the only copy I have that I whited out. You cannot see Fidelity's bid/ask prices here, as well as the last traded price of the time and sale tape, but you can see the last traded price above for the total history. Looks like there was an update to the sales when I refreshed the history sales and the time and sales tape, or the total history was faster than the tape. I assure you the bid and ask for Fidelity was around the last traded price of MSFT which was $335.22. Either way, the price for Fidelity is more right and Schwab was Drastically behind. Even though Schwab had the wrong time on their time and sales by 12 minutes the chart was showing being updated to the right time frame, but the prices were off. In this instance, the price difference was $335.22-$334.055 = $1.165. The price was off by more at other times, but for this screenshot, it was $1.165.\n\nI wish I recorded the screen because it would have shown all of the information and would have been better to see what was going on I can tell you that for sure! Fidelity Green or Red by $0-2 and Schwab the opposite by $0-2. I told this information to a Schwab Broker and the problem was fixed after about 10:20 AM EST, but still, this isn't cool. I compared SSE's information with AAPL and MSFT with Fidelity's platform and all was good I believe after 10:20 AM EST. I still checked throughout the day between the two platforms just to make sure, and everything did line up after 10:20 AM EST. Although minutes don't matter in terms of weeks or month-long trading or holding long term if you're day trading or short term trading this matters. I shouldn't be day trading or short-term trading, but I am to make money, and because I want to. This isn't what I want to be seeing from my broker. I should switch to Fidelity after having to experience this. I have used Schwab for my brokerage, Roth IRA, and checking accounts, but maybe it's time for a change. Schwab does have a great platform but it could use updating. I am sure that'll happen when they merge TDA's platform with SSE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jukgi5qqkoy71.png?width=1691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68f7e590fe5ae5993d0d7fd028c0d1d8ed7f8695\n\nTL:DR: On November 4th, from roughly 10:15 AM to 10:20 AM EST I was comparing Schwab's bid &amp; ask and time &amp; sales to Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform. I compared AAPL and MSFT information, I only took a screenshot of MSFT. Schwab was showing different data in terms of pricing by shown here at $1.165 difference. I was seeing a difference in about $0-2 in sales pricing. I have only one screenshot. I whited out some info but whited out too much info here because I had other copies of my screenshots but accidentally deleted them. Schwab fixed their market prices after I called them, but still not good to be happening on their platform. It's not like this was happening on purpose, it's just something that was happening with Schwab's services. I have used Schwab for mainly all of my investment accounts, but maybe it's time to move. I do like Schwab a lot though. After this, I should probably switch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this isn't taken down lol. I haven't had a post on WSB before and it would be cool to not have this taken down, so people can see why Fidelity is better!",

        "selftext": "TLDR: I started investing too quickly and although not suffering any major losses I\u2019m worried about how buying and selling a single stock over and over for little gain will affect my taxes \n\nI understand all of the mistakes I\u2019ve made, so again, bear with me. I used cash app to invest some spare change starting early September to learn first hand how the market works. Initially used very small amounts like $20-$50 in what others recommended as safe stocks like MSFT, AAPL, GOOG. Also bought some that I knew nothing about, like AFRM and COIN that ended up doing better than the others resulting in premature buys. \nShortly after I started the evergrande news was released, I saw the 60 minutes episode on the Facebook whistleblower and I became infatuated with trying to figure out what affects the market. I used fidelity to track daily buys and sells while comparing this to news, earnings, Reddit, yahoo finance etc. Even though I saw that there was no predicting anything, I started to get a little riskier. I bought dips with more money without doing dd, nothing significant but $100 or $200. \nSo my question lies with AFRM specifically, I\u2019ve bought and sold several times which is where I stupidly did not think about how this would affect me later. 9/3 buy $20, sell 10/7 for $26.53. 10/12 buy $45 10/29 sell $52.75. 11/1 buy 100 11/12 sell 96.54 Although I\u2019m not sure why I sold because I\u2019ve found that I often don\u2019t FOMO, i more so convince myself I\u2019m too late already and end up just watching. \nAll in all, my plan is to switch to a safer account like fidelity. I haven\u2019t started investing there yet because I\u2019m worried about how having investments within two separate entities will affect my taxes as well as how the buying and selling will influence them. Help? I usually get a decent return but I can\u2019t find information specifically regarding to instances like this",

Management\n\nAs part of Paysafe\u2019s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they\u2019ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They\u2019ve hired PayPal\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook\u2019s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl\u2019s Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.\n\nStill, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe\u2019s value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader\u2019s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.\n\nRegardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of [Visa](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/skrill-usa-launches-skrill-virtual-visar-prepaid-card-in-us/), [Coinbase](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-issues-coinbase-s-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/), [Fubo Gaming](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-streamlines-payments-for-interactive-wagering-with-fubo-gaming-in-us/), [FOXbet](https://www.njgamblingfun.com/nj/sports-news/paysafe-continues-its-push-into-online-gaming), [Golden Nugget](http://www.greensheet.com/newswire.php?newswire_id=53685), [Bankable](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-partners-with-bankable-to-provide-omnichannel-banking-services/), [Wix](https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2021/smbs-can-accept-payments-with-paysafe-skrill-on-wix/), [Repay](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), [WynnBet](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/wynnbet-taps-paysafe-for-payments-and-marketing-solutions/), [Betfred USA](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-expands-betfred-usa-sports-partnership-through-income-access-deal/), [OwnersBox](https://incomeaccess.com/contenthub/ownersbox-launches-affiliate-program/), [Dutch neobank bunq](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/bunq-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-cash-deposits-for-digital-banking/), [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/), Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, [Smart Property Systems](https://globalfintechseries.com/banking/digital-payments/paysafe-partners-with-smart-property-systems-in-north-america/), Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, [Montana Lottery](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-powers-online-payments-for-montana-lotterys-sportsbook/), PlayUP, [SuperBook Sports](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-platform-launches-with-superbook-sports-in-colorado-and-new-jersey/) and [Bitrise](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-accelerates-innovation-with-bitrise-for-faster-digital-wallets-payments/).\n\nIn that same period, they\u2019ve also:\n\n* expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to [48 states](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-skrill-expands-its-crypto-service/),\n* expanded their digital wallets to [trade](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-neteller-launches-fiat-to-crypto-withdrawal-service/) 38 \\[digital\\]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies\n* launched online cash payments on Microsoft\u2019s [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) in 22 countries\n* struck deals with [Snowflake](https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/paysafe-integrates-snowflake-to-power-cloud-based-approach-for-enhanced-customer-experiences/) and Amazon\u2019s [AWS](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/paysafe-partners-aws-to-become-cloud-based-payments-provider/) to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition,\n* [launched](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) a new global travel safeguarding model,\n* a unique innovation that quickly led to a new [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally.\n\nAlso during this time, they announced the appointments of:\n\n* Digital wallet division CEO, [Chirag Patel](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-chirag-patel-to-lead-its-digital-wallets-division/) (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander)\n* North American iGaming CEO, [Zak Cutler](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-zak-cutler-to-lead-its-north-america-igaming-business/) (fmr DraftKings exec),\n* Boardmember [Mark Brooker](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/paysafe-appoints-mark-brooker-as-non-exec-director/) (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill)\n\nAll that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada\u2019s [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeding the future growth right now\u2026 The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective\u2026It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\u201d  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.\n\nLastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.\n\nThe types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe\u2019s \u201cvalue creation playbook\u201d which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), \u201cthose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s worth underscoring Foley\u2019s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He\u2019s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, \u201cMy whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.\u201d  Though he\u2019s not Paysafe\u2019s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that \u201c  Bill is highly engaged with the company.\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. Lockup Expiration\n\nSome bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe\u2019s value creation playbook. Between Foley\u2019s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone\u2019s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.\n\nUpon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified \u201cbase returns for a four year hold period\u201d of \u201c2.9x to 3.8x\u201d from $10.\n\nFrom their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): \u201cThe Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. Valuation\n\nPaysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.\n\nNow trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner\u2019s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.\n\nOr maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a \"300% higher\" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of \u201c$3.7 billion\u201d, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.\n\nInitially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE\u2019s financial data, like YF\u2019s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  It\u2019s not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.\n\nObviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.\n\nTrue price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil then, here are a few reference points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment as a separate company:\n\nThe eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.\n\nAdyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen\u2019s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe\u2019s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That\u2019s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.\n\nUsing Adyen\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company\u2019s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.\n\nAgain, that represents less than a third of Paysafe\u2019s total business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing\n\nPaysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.\n\nFor 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively.\n\nIn all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDigital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet\n\nMany compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here\u2019s a deeper look into that comparison:\n\nAs noted earlier, Paysafe\u2019s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.\n\nBy comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal\u2019s troubles as a \u201cbuying opportunity.\u201d\n\nSome will reasonably say that\u2019s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal\u2019s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).\n\nPaysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020\u2019s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe\u2019s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal\u2019s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.\n\nPaysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a \u201cfree cash flow machine,\u201d Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).\n\nThere\u2019s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL\u2019s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE\u2019s potential acquisition debt and dilution:\n\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90\n* PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75\n* PayPal\u2019s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41\n\nThose metrics average to a share price of $27.31\n\nWhen factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSector multiples:\n\nBecause Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \\~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.\n\nAfter removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here\u2019s Paysafe\u2019s share price with the averaged peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67\n* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17\n* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72\n\nAverage : $41.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS\u2019s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE\u2019s recent price action, but certainly not all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, \u201cthe market doesn\u2019t care,\u201d but I\u2019m confident that\u2019ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER\u2019s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of \u201clook at the chart\u201d and \u201cprice is truth.\u201d  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.\n\nNo, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, \u201cThe stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.\u201d\n\nDo with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.  Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I\u2019d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",

I understand short term vs long term capital gains (holding over a year results in less taxes) but I don\u2019t understand the tax filing portion of it all. When I file taxes, do I have to note every single individual stock I sell? Will Webull and Coinbase give me a tax form at the end of the year and I just enter that?

It is currently in an Empower retirement account with limited investment options. My current split is 80% Fidelity High Growth Fund and 20% Vanguard 2040 . The balance is just shy of $200k. I took \"control\" and have gotten some great returns, but I want to add some bitcoin exposure through $GBTC and doubt that will be possible any time soon via my empower account.\n\nAny recommendations on providers to consider? Can I just transfer it all to my Fidelity investment account?",

I am currently only 19 and don't make a lot of money right now so I believe I have a long journey ahead of me. I opened an account with Fidelity and currently hold 1 share of AMD, MSFT, and GME each. I also have a Coinbase account with around 100$ in BTC, ETH, ETC, and Doge each.\n\nI am just wondering how to approach long-term investing. Right now, I just buy a share of my favorite stocks for example on my next paycheck I will buy one share of AAPL regardless of its price. Then the following week, I might buy another share of AMD or even a share of NVDA. These are just some companies that I use and really like. Is this a good way to start? \n\nNote: As for my riskier investments like GME and crypto, I don't plan on buying more for the time being. I hold a share of GME for the squeeze potential and crypto for its long-term growth potential.",

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm fairly new to investing, and I'm looking to put more money in, but I'm a little hesitant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have about $500 dollars in AMD @ around $85 in a Fidelity account. I also have $1,200 in my Robinhood account that I'd like to buy more AMD or XILINX. I'm hesitant to buy more because I was going to buy some when AMD was at $120, but I was hoping it would dip a bit. Turns out this was a huge mistake as you all know.\n\nOnto the bigger question, I'm a bit confused on how average share price, and either averaging up or down works. I understand the concept, but am unsure when it makes sense to do either. For example, If I wanted to buy $500 of AMD right now, would it make sense to transfer the money to Fidelity to buy it on there since my average is $85, or buy on Robinhood which would make my average whatever AMD is currently trading at?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly any advice would be appreciated. Again, I'm really kicking myself for not buying AMD/XILINX 2 weeks ago when I was so close to doing it. If I decide to buy now, I don't want to mess up even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

        "selftext": "My 401K is hosted by Fidelity and is invested in a basket based on the retirement target date. This has always underperformed the marker (VTI or SPY) so I want to invest it in something that at least performs close to the market. However, my employer limits what we can actually invest in and are very much limited to mutual funds even in brokerage link account. I have screened all the MF that we can invest in and the top-performing ones (attached) have an expense ratio of around 0.7-0.8%. What I was going to do was to invest 30% in something like VTI (U.S. total market), 20% something like VXUS (international market), 10% bonds, and split the remaining 40% equally among the MFs in the attached picture. They all have been growing more than 20% in 10, 5, 3 years time frames. So it will be around 4% in each MF in the attached list. I know there are some redundancy but this way if one MF does not perform well then it wouldn't affect my portfolio too much. The expense ratio is too high but if you put $10,000 into one of these MFs then the fee would be around $70 but if they continue to beat the market by about 10%, that would be $1000 a year. These funds need dedicated people to be able to beat the market over a long period so the expense ratio seems necessary to outperform the market.  I am looking for comments on this strategy.

        "selftext": "Hi guys! You should checkout $APPS as a manipulated stock.  I am a big believer in DT and the performance of the team (Bill Stone &amp; Co) who are simply, like, amazing! Continuing my investigation into the rather obvious manipulation of $APPS stock by the likes of Fidelity, Blackrock, etc. Today, I went in to purchase options for the January 20, 2023 $140 Call option in my Fidelity account. Once again, for the second day in a row, I see that Fidelity shows a $197 Bid/ $205 Ask on this call, while on another screen it shows it at only $4.10 Bid / $4.80 ask. I suspect that this is not a mistake. Fidelity (and Blackrock, which are master manipulators) must know that the stock is actually worth much more. Any dumb DCF model or valuation would show you that. For instance, $1B in revenues compounded at 30% per year growth rate will give you around $300 per share (which means that DT is undervalued by 5X today!). \n\n[Fidelity screen shot showing that somewhere, somehow APPS call is valued at 197.50 Bid \\/ $206 Ask, which would mean that someone knows APPS is actually worth $322 per share.](https://preview.redd.it/tgrtnrpmfl081.png?width=2062&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e285d281c4779f8b3fab96314ef2d2990988fd8b)",

        "selftext": "My 401K is hosted by Fidelity and is  invested in a basket based on the retirement target date. This has  always underperformed the marker (VTI or SPY) so I want to invest it in  something that at least performs close to the market. However, my  employer limits what we can actually invest in and are very much limited  to mutual funds even in brokerage link account.\n\nI  have screened all the MF that we can invest in and the top-performing  ones (attached) have an expense ratio of around 0.7-0.8%. What I was  going to do was to invest 30% in something like VTI (U.S. total market),  20% something like VXUS (international market), 10% bonds, and split  the remaining 40% equally among the MFs in the attached picture. They  all have been growing more than 20% in 10, 5, 3 years time frames. So it  will be around 4% in each MF in the attached list.\n\nI  know there are some redundancy but this way if one MF does not perform  well then it wouldn't affect my portfolio too much. The expense ratio is  too high but if you put $10,000 into one of these MFs then the fee  would be around $70 but if they continue to beat the market by about  10%, that would be $1000 a year. These funds need dedicated people to be  able to beat the market over a long period so the expense ratio seems  necessary to outperform the market.  I am looking for comments on this  strategy.\n\nI  did a backtest for 10 years with an initial amount of $1000 and  invested $1000/month and my final balance would be $202,000 vs $150,000  so a difference of $50,000. The fee difference would have been around  $5000.\n\nThanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/030sythjak181.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=340c8a2a408c4a842cbc76f9b51c237d69aa0541\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8q6rdckak181.png?width=3339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a35d7688998752c4a92b034f739391f0af5e68b",

        "selftext": "Here are Parts 2 - 4 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) covers Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, and an expected miss for Q3ER.  I recommend starting with the [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) in Part 1, and following the links if still interested.\n\n# 2. Debt\n\nPaysafe\u2019s recent acquisitions have spawned several misleading claims using faulty numbers to generate doubt about the company\u2019s ability to manage debt.For example:\n\n* One article tried to make a specific case that Paysafe can\u2019t cover debt due to Q2\u2019s 46% free cash flow conversion rate. The author's acrobatic bias ignores the obvious fact that the Q2 balance sheet clearly states a year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate of 70%, not 46%. The CFO noted that Q2\u2019s conversion rate was temporarily affected by a one-time tax payment that is to be partially refunded. (Notably, Q1\u2019s free cash flow conversion rate was 96%. At $108 million, it was a 28% YoY increase.)\n* Another article cries liquidity problems, citing, \u201cPaysafe Ltds earnings cannot cover its interest expense. If the situation continues, the company may have to issue more debt.\u201d By relying on websites that blindly auto-calculate debt service ratios, the article doesn't account for recent debt restructuring and dramatically misrepresents forward expenses by ignoring:\n\n1. $84 million in one-time merger related expenses will not be repeated,\n2. over $40 million in one-time debt restructuring fees will not be repeated,\n3. newly reduced interest expenses resulting in roughly [$70 million](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) in annualized savings.\n\n* A third article mistakenly claims Paysafe, \u201cwill add another $1 billion in net debt to close the Latin America deals.\u201d  In truth, the two deals mentioned total $550 million (SafetyPay at [$441m](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005095/en/Paysafe-to-Acquire-SafetyPay/) and Pago Efectivo at [$108.5m](https://www.alantra.com/ib-transaction/grupo-el-comercio-sell-side-advisory-pagoefectivo-paysafe/)). A third European acquisition, viafintech, is [reported](https://finanz-szene.de/payments/der-2-exit-von-barzahlen-doch-was-ist-seit-dem-1-exit-passiert/) to be valued at $42.5 million euros ($49 million USD). While the three deals total roughly $598 million, much of that can be covered between Paysafe\u2019s $247.8 million in cash, their $270 million in undrawn revolving credit and their $360-$430 million in free cash flow. Total added debt will likely be less than half of what the article assumes. (In fairness, the author later admitted he read the transcript wrong.)\n\nAfter paying down $1.2 billion in debt in Q1, Paysafe used its two notch credit rating upgrade from [Moody\u2019s](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Paysafe-to-B1-stable-outlook--PR_443474) and [S&amp;P](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) to reorganize remaining debt, extend maturity and significantly lower average interest rates, reducing interest expenses by $70 million. The result, inclusive of new debt from acquisitions: credit upgrades were reaffirmed along with a $305 million revolving credit facility and the company will save around $43 million in annualized interest expense.This means forward debt-related costs are on track to drop by more than half, from an estimated $165 million in 2021 to less than $80 million in 2022. Combined with $84 million in other non-recurring merger-related expenses, that\u2019s over $160 million in cost reductions going forward.Strong free cash flow and over $160 million in reduced costs can go a long way to quickly paying down debt. Add in the expected acquisition growth synergies and the company\u2019s quoted path to a 35% EBITDA margin, and the picture looks even better.  Management noted, \u201cthe deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d  The very realistic potential of 17-18% revenue growth could attain that target ratio in short order.All this points to sustainable deleveraging, paving the way for more growth through M&amp;A. (It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the company stands to take in more than half a billion cash from outstanding warrants, which will directly benefit enterprise value and inorganic growth potential.)Carrying large debt is extremely common in the Fintech sector and Paysafe is by no means an outlier here. (Square, Repay, Fiserv, Shift4, Affirm, Bill and Paysign all have worse debt/EBITDA ratios and most of them still have negative earnings). In itself, debt leverage is not a bad thing, particularly if it\u2019s manageable and generates more growth. That definitely appears to be the case here.\n\n# 3. Profit\n\nWhen considering how Paysafe is setting itself up for future profit potential, here are some points worth underscoring:\n\n* Without $92 million in non-recurring costs, Q1 would have been very profitable, beating analysts consensus by as much +0.10 EPS.\n* Despite Q2\u2019s $40 million in non-repeating costs, Paysafe still managed to beat on earnings with its first profitable quarter as a newly public company.\n* Roughly $167 million in H1 expenses will not repeat going forward:\n\n1. $84m one-time share based compensation,\n2. $40m one-time accelerated capitalized debt fees,\n3. $43m estimated reduction in annual interest expenses\n\n* Those reductions alone represent a potential +0.22 EPS, which exceeds analysts projections.  (Some platforms have reported analysts estimate 3-400% profit growth for 2022 with an average of 75% annual profit growth thereafter.  Fortunately, on Q3 guidance, analysts have been revising their forward estimates downwards which ultimately better positions PSFE to beat consensus down the road. This contrasts with analysts\u2019 initial EPS estimates which did not appear to fully account for the one-time merger and debt restructuring costs.)\n* Paysafe\u2019s margins are also expected to expand as they work through deliberate measures to de-risk future growth.  For example, their integrated processing take rate has been compressed by strategic Direct Marketing exits in anticipation of new compliance rules. This is expected to abate by end of year.  Management notes: \u201cwe do expect EBITDA margins to expand in the back-half of the year and to continue that like a steady drumbeat going into next year as well\u201d reflecting \u201ccontinued strength in integrated processing, including the on-boarding of several new e-commerce clients in late Q3 and early Q4, stronger growth in digital wallet as well as sequential improvement in direct marketing.\u201d\n* Between Q3 and FY guidance, there is an implied guidance for a Q4 EBITDA of $153 million.  That represents a YoY EBITDA growth of 60.5%, which may offer a signal as to how moving beyond legacy de-risking headwinds can start to improve the margin picture going forward.\n* Their fastest growing segment, eCash, has a high take rate of 7.2%.  For H1/21, they reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth which would reasonably point to a future business mix with higher overall margins.  Further growth in this segment stands to benefit from their new LATAM expansion, their new Glory Ltd partnership, as well as their recently launched US [campaign](https://www.skrill.com/es-us/enviar-transferir-dinero-mexico/?utm_source=tv&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=DIEGOSMT) to engage the US/Mexico remittance market (worth [$40 billion](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-migrants-home-record-40-billion-2020-75642052) annually). Also, their [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) deal expands eCash in 22 countries and their recent deals with [ZEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-extends-partnership-zen-com-080000606.html), [REPAY](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), and [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/) further expands their eCash network across the US and in 25 European countries.\n* With a gross margin of 61-63%, upon execution of their two year strategy to \u201cunlock over $100m organic adj. EBITDA\u201d ([page 28](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)), management cites a potential \u201cpro forma upside that could drive EBITDA CAGR to 21%.\u201d\n* One aspect of this margin expansion strategy is in the company\u2019s ongoing integration of their various business segments into a single code on a cloud-based gateway, the Unity Platform. This streamlining will enable them to reduce costs and scale up quickly in new markets and in emerging verticals like travel, [trading in the wallet](https://coinquora.com/paysafes-neteller-adds-fiat-to-crypto-feature-on-its-platform/), digital goods, online gaming, and banking as a service.  Among the benefits of this new synthesis:\n\n1. it increases operating margins through cost-saving efficiencies and eliminating redundancies (automating underwriting, 2/3 reduction in data centers)\n2. it enables them to forward unsolicited cost savings to partners, merchants and users, helping them retain and gain new marketshare,\n3. it eliminates on-boarding each service separately by making their entire suite automatically available through a single gateway, which builds in substantial cross-selling opportunities\n\n# 4. Float\n\nThe number of institutional funds owning PSFE has grown from 187 to 297 over the last quarter. At this point, nearly all the major funds hold shares at a cost basis much higher than the current price. These include Wells Fargo, Blackrock, Citigroup, State Street, JP Morgan, Francisco Partners, Naya Capital and noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point), David Tepper (Appaloosa), Aaron Cohen (Survetta), Seth Rosen (Nitorum) and Leon Cooperman, (who personally owns over a million shares).

        "selftext": "Here are Parts 2 - 4 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/) covers Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, and an expected miss for Q3ER.  I recommend starting with the [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/) in Part 1, and following the links if still interested.\n\n# 2. Debt\n\nPaysafe\u2019s recent acquisitions have spawned several misleading claims using faulty numbers to generate doubt about the company\u2019s ability to manage debt.For example:\n\n* One article tried to make a specific case that Paysafe can\u2019t cover debt due to Q2\u2019s 46% free cash flow conversion rate. The author's acrobatic bias ignores the obvious fact that the Q2 balance sheet clearly states a year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate of 70%, not 46%. The CFO noted that Q2\u2019s conversion rate was temporarily affected by a one-time tax payment that is to be partially refunded. (Notably, Q1\u2019s free cash flow conversion rate was 96%. At $108 million, it was a 28% YoY increase.)\n* Another article cries liquidity problems, citing, \u201cPaysafe Ltds earnings cannot cover its interest expense. If the situation continues, the company may have to issue more debt.\u201d By relying on websites that blindly auto-calculate debt service ratios, the article doesn't account for recent debt restructuring and dramatically misrepresents forward expenses by ignoring:\n\n1. $84 million in one-time merger related expenses will not be repeated,\n2. over $40 million in one-time debt restructuring fees will not be repeated,\n3. newly reduced interest expenses resulting in roughly [$70 million](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) in annualized savings.\n\n* A third article mistakenly claims Paysafe, \u201cwill add another $1 billion in net debt to close the Latin America deals.\u201d  In truth, the two deals mentioned total $550 million (SafetyPay at [$441m](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005095/en/Paysafe-to-Acquire-SafetyPay/) and Pago Efectivo at [$108.5m](https://www.alantra.com/ib-transaction/grupo-el-comercio-sell-side-advisory-pagoefectivo-paysafe/)). A third European acquisition, viafintech, is [reported](https://finanz-szene.de/payments/der-2-exit-von-barzahlen-doch-was-ist-seit-dem-1-exit-passiert/) to be valued at $42.5 million euros ($49 million USD). While the three deals total roughly $598 million, much of that can be covered between Paysafe\u2019s $247.8 million in cash, their $270 million in undrawn revolving credit and their $360-$430 million in free cash flow. Total added debt will likely be less than half of what the article assumes. (In fairness, the author later admitted he read the transcript wrong.)\n\nAfter paying down $1.2 billion in debt in Q1, Paysafe used its two notch credit rating upgrade from [Moody\u2019s](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Paysafe-to-B1-stable-outlook--PR_443474) and [S&amp;P](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) to reorganize remaining debt, extend maturity and significantly lower average interest rates, reducing interest expenses by $70 million. The result, inclusive of new debt from acquisitions: credit upgrades were reaffirmed along with a $305 million revolving credit facility and the company will save around $43 million in annualized interest expense.This means forward debt-related costs are on track to drop by more than half, from an estimated $165 million in 2021 to less than $80 million in 2022. Combined with $84 million in other non-recurring merger-related expenses, that\u2019s over $160 million in cost reductions going forward.Strong free cash flow and over $160 million in reduced costs can go a long way to quickly paying down debt. Add in the expected acquisition growth synergies and the company\u2019s quoted path to a 35% EBITDA margin, and the picture looks even better.  Management noted, \u201cthe deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d  The very realistic potential of 17-18% revenue growth could attain that target ratio in short order.All this points to sustainable deleveraging, paving the way for more growth through M&amp;A. (It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the company stands to take in more than half a billion cash from outstanding warrants, which will directly benefit enterprise value and inorganic growth potential.)Carrying large debt is extremely common in the Fintech sector and Paysafe is by no means an outlier here. (Square, Repay, Fiserv, Shift4, Affirm, Bill and Paysign all have worse debt/EBITDA ratios and most of them still have negative earnings). In itself, debt leverage is not a bad thing, particularly if it\u2019s manageable and generates more growth. That definitely appears to be the case here.\n\n# 3. Profit\n\nWhen considering how Paysafe is setting itself up for future profit potential, here are some points worth underscoring:\n\n* Without $92 million in non-recurring costs, Q1 would have been very profitable, beating analysts consensus by as much +0.10 EPS.\n* Despite Q2\u2019s $40 million in non-repeating costs, Paysafe still managed to beat on earnings with its first profitable quarter as a newly public company.\n* Roughly $167 million in H1 expenses will not repeat going forward:\n\n1. $84m one-time share based compensation,\n2. $40m one-time accelerated capitalized debt fees,\n3. $43m estimated reduction in annual interest expenses\n\n* Those reductions alone represent a potential +0.22 EPS, which exceeds analysts projections.  (Some platforms have reported analysts estimate 3-400% profit growth for 2022 with an average of 75% annual profit growth thereafter.  Fortunately, on Q3 guidance, analysts have been revising their forward estimates downwards which ultimately better positions PSFE to beat consensus down the road. This contrasts with analysts\u2019 initial EPS estimates which did not appear to fully account for the one-time merger and debt restructuring costs.)\n* Paysafe\u2019s margins are also expected to expand as they work through deliberate measures to de-risk future growth.  For example, their integrated processing take rate has been compressed by strategic Direct Marketing exits in anticipation of new compliance rules. This is expected to abate by end of year.  Management notes: \u201cwe do expect EBITDA margins to expand in the back-half of the year and to continue that like a steady drumbeat going into next year as well\u201d reflecting \u201ccontinued strength in integrated processing, including the on-boarding of several new e-commerce clients in late Q3 and early Q4, stronger growth in digital wallet as well as sequential improvement in direct marketing.\u201d\n* Between Q3 and FY guidance, there is an implied guidance for a Q4 EBITDA of $153 million.  That represents a YoY EBITDA growth of 60.5%, which may offer a signal as to how moving beyond legacy de-risking headwinds can start to improve the margin picture going forward.\n* Their fastest growing segment, eCash, has a high take rate of 7.2%.  For H1/21, they reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth which would reasonably point to a future business mix with higher overall margins.  Further growth in this segment stands to benefit from their new LATAM expansion, their new Glory Ltd partnership, as well as their recently launched US [campaign](https://www.skrill.com/es-us/enviar-transferir-dinero-mexico/?utm_source=tv&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=DIEGOSMT) to engage the US/Mexico remittance market (worth [$40 billion](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-migrants-home-record-40-billion-2020-75642052) annually). Also, their [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) deal expands eCash in 22 countries and their recent deals with [ZEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-extends-partnership-zen-com-080000606.html), [REPAY](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), and [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/) further expands their eCash network across the US and in 25 European countries.\n* With a gross margin of 61-63%, upon execution of their two year strategy to \u201cunlock over $100m organic adj. EBITDA\u201d ([page 28](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)), management cites a potential \u201cpro forma upside that could drive EBITDA CAGR to 21%.\u201d\n* One aspect of this margin expansion strategy is in the company\u2019s ongoing integration of their various business segments into a single code on a cloud-based gateway, the Unity Platform. This streamlining will enable them to reduce costs and scale up quickly in new markets and in emerging verticals like travel, [trading in the wallet](https://coinquora.com/paysafes-neteller-adds-fiat-to-crypto-feature-on-its-platform/), digital goods, online gaming, and banking as a service.  Among the benefits of this new synthesis:\n\n1. it increases operating margins through cost-saving efficiencies and eliminating redundancies (automating underwriting, 2/3 reduction in data centers)\n2. it enables them to forward unsolicited cost savings to partners, merchants and users, helping them retain and gain new marketshare,\n3. it eliminates on-boarding each service separately by making their entire suite automatically available through a single gateway, which builds in substantial cross-selling opportunities\n\n# 4. Float\n\nThe number of institutional funds owning PSFE has grown from 187 to 297 over the last quarter. At this point, nearly all the major funds hold shares at a cost basis much higher than the current price. These include Wells Fargo, Blackrock, Citigroup, State Street, JP Morgan, Francisco Partners, Naya Capital and noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point), David Tepper (Appaloosa), Aaron Cohen (Survetta), Seth Rosen (Nitorum) and Leon Cooperman, (who personally owns over a million shares). Notably, most of these investors bought shares before Paysafe\u2019s [recent history](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/) of value creation.  Cross-referencing the most up to date [record](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) with older filings, some [estimate](https://solarpvinvestor.com/topic/3255-paysafe-holdings-psfe/?tab=comments#comment-103030) the true available float is between 70-80 million shares. For what has historically been a low beta stock, theoretically, a reduced free float influences the proportionate affect of true short interest and could cause the stock price to move faster.\n\n  \nLinks to the rest of the article can be found in [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/) once they are complete.

Parts 1- 4 covered Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, debt, and profit as well as available float.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.\n\n# 5. Blackstone Group\n\nMany have blamed PSFE\u2019s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group\u2019s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) with Paysafe\u2019s March 31 20F ([p.124](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares.\n\nIt\u2019s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2.  BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you\u2019d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone\u2019s 13F and whether they\u2019d sold shares, Paysafe\u2019s investor relations responded, \"That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing. \u00a0It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock.\"\n\nMake of it what you will, but there\u2019s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC.\n\nOther factors to consider about Blackstone\u2019s stake:\n\n* Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment.  In truth, as Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP), Paysafe, \u201cwas taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.\u201d At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that\u2019s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (\u00a32.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That\u2019s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.).\n* This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC [paid](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/30924/blackstonecvc-agree-296-billion-deal-for-paysafe) \u201ca 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,\u201d because, as Reuter\u2019s [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a/paysafe-backs-3-9-billion-offer-from-blackstone-cvc-group-idUSKBN1AK0KN), insiders close to the deal said private equity had \u201ca decade-long thesis that the shift to \\[digital payments\\] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d This \u201cdecade-long\u201d thesis matches Blackstone\u2019s typical investment term of \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d according to their published [white paper](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf). 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their [proxy statement](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf) when approving the business combination (see #9).\n* More recently, Reuters [reported](https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idINKBN28H1GP): \u201cMartin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.\u201d Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n* And last month, CEO Philip McHugh [assured](https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-digitalbanking-paysafe#/): \u201cYou won\u2019t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we\u2019re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in crypto, in travel and online gaming.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6. Insider Ownership\n\nBears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe\u2019s [share registration](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) confirms this argument is another non-starter:\n\n* CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares\n* COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares\n* Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares\n* Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares\n* 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 7. Competition\n\nBears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe\u2019s lunch, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they\u2019re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and [real-time pay-in/pay-out](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skrill-usa-enhances-digital-wallet-080000953.html), which they say \u201cfills a gap in the U.S. market.\u201d\n\nSome theorize that Paysafe\u2019s competitive threat is the reason it\u2019s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company\u2019s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested.\n\nSpeculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions.\n\nThis last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: \u201cBecause it\u2019s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that\u2019s easy to copy.\u201d He further notes, \u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nPaysafe\u2019s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding [model](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Safeguarding-the-future-of-travel.pdf). It\u2019s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe\u2019s [award winning](https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2021/05/31/57794-paysafe-wins-payments-provider-award) platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators).\n\nOften embedded behind the scenes so that customers don\u2019t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with [MasterCard](https://www.mastercard.com/news/europe/en-uk/newsroom/press-releases/en-gb/2020/march/paysafe-and-mastercard-extend-strategic-partnership/), Visa, Fiserv, [WorldPay](https://www.infinicept.com/payment-facilitator/archive/game-on-for-worldpay-and-paysafe/)(US DraftKings), [Apple Pay](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/apple-pay/), [Google Pay](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/google-pay/), [PayPal](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/payment-methods/paypal/), [Sightline](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/payment-methods/sightline/), REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the [award](https://www.paysafe.com/de-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-wins-two-payments-awards/) winning [Coinbase/Visa](https://www.thepower50.com/paysafe-issues-coinbases-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/) card.  In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe\u2019s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting.  It\u2019s often easier for a \"competitor\" to just give them a cut of the take.  CEO McHugh notes, \u201cThat\u2019s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.\u201d  And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, \u201cIn Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.\u201d\n\nRather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone.  This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as \u201cubiquitous. It\u2019s just everywhere.\u201d\n\nHaving cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in \u201chard to do, hard to copy\u201d niche verticals. CEO McHugh: \u201cThat\u2019s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.\u201d\n\nThrough its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large [suite](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521055290/d18419df4a.htm) of interconnected products and payment rails:\n\n* credit and debit card processing\n* integrated eCommerce processing\n* online banking with real-time bank payments\n* ACH check transactions\n* digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality\n* person to person payments in 40 currencies\n* eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base\n* 38 cryptocurrencies in over 90 markets\n* trading crypto and stocks in the wallet\n* international money transfers\n* branded gift card management\n* recurring billing\n* data mining for targeted direct marketing\n* travel safeguarding for most major airlines\n* tokenization and encryption (NFTs)\n* in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes)\n\nAs the CEO points out, \u201cMerchants just want sales regardless of payment method\u2026There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products\u2026we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market\u2026The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well.\"\n\n# Reviews:\n\nWhile on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren\u2019t aware of Paysafe\u2019s award winning consumer products like [Paysafecard](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PAYSAFE-LIMITED-120977165/news/Paysafe-Paysafecard-wins-Hermes-Business-Award-2021-36750942/) and [Skrill](https://www.paymentexpert.com/2019/11/01/skrill-wins-best-digital-wallet-at-juniper-research-2019-awards/), often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript \u201cPaysafe\u201d with only 287 reviews.\n\nMeanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe\u2019s actual consumer-facing products like:\n\n* Paysafecard: \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) [43K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n* Skrill: \u201cgreat\u201d (4/5 stars) [19K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skrill.com)\n* Skrill Money Transfer: \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) [9K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/transfers.skrill.com)\n\nBy contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors:\n\n* PayPal: \u201cbad\" (1.2/5 stars) [20K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n* Stripe: \u201cAverage\u201d (3.3/5 stars) [6.6K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/stripe.com)\n* Cash App: \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars) [3K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/cash.app)\n* Zelle: \u201cbad\u201d (1.1/5 stars) [398 reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/zellepay.com)\n* Venmo: \u201cbad\u201d (1.3/5 stars) [281 reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/venmo.com)\n\nNote: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless. To be fair, those competing platforms get much better Apple mobile app reviews but, even there, Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill gets a respectable, [4.4 out of 5 stars](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skrill-pay-transfer-money/id718248239) with 7.2K ratings. And at GooglePlay, their Paysafecard get 4.3/5 stars with over [103K reviews](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.paysafecard.android&amp;referrer=adjust_reftag%3DcIGmAvoU2TFcK%26utm_source%3DWebsite%2B-%2BApp%2BSeite).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a link to the next part go to [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/).

Short interest is high as many got trapped when it ran from $10-40. CTB is over 500% and there is 100% share utilization.
