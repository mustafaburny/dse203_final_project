        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 19, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed today in a choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recovering some losses after yesterday\u2019s session, closing 0.17% and 0.47% higher respectively. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly, closing 0.18% down while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued underperforming, closing 1.21% down today and almost 5% down this week. Market participants continue to digest the implication of the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Meeting Minutes, which showed there are increasing discussions surrounding a potential taper timeline, with members suggesting they could begin this year if the current pace of economic recovery continues.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. \n\nYesterday\u2019s meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nToday, the Labor Department released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which, along with other recent reports, vindicates the Fed\u2019s assessment that the labor market has substantially recovered from heights of the pandemic-induced recession. Initial Unemployment claims came in at 348,000, the lowest level since March 2020 and better than the 364,000 expected and 377,000 the previous week. Continuing claims came in at 2.82 million, roughly in line with the 2.8 million expected\n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, \u201cA couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.\u201d\n\nOn inflation, the minutes said \u201cWith regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory\u201d and \u201cSome other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound.\u201d However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.\n\nIn short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, \u201cA few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.\u201d\n\nI recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it's really not that long and super insightful: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In more earnings news, shares of Robinhood (HOOD) fell 10% after reporting earnings while my favorite stock Nvidia (NVDA) rose 4% after smashing earnings estimates and raising guidance moving ahead.\n* The Nigerian government said it expected to lift its ban on Twitter (TWTR) by the end of the year.\n* The SEC charged 3 former Netflix (NFLX) employees and two of their associates for insider trading accumulating $3 million.\n* The Federal Trade Commission filed a new version of its antitrust lawsuit against Facebook (FB) on Thursday, seeking to jump-start its case with bolstered allegations that the company is abusing a monopoly position in social media.\n* Tesla (TSLA) is holding an event, billed AI Day, in order to promote and showcase its AI technology. This comes amid an investigation by The National Highway Traffic Safety Safety Administration over Tesla assisted-driving technology\n* Toyota, Volkswagen (VWAGY), Ford Motors (F) have been forced to cut production once again due to the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Analog Devices (ADI) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "tl;dr - Plantronics makes communication devices like headsets. 2022 FYQ2 guidance (particularly with respect to the chip shortage) has disproportionately lowered the price of the stock. There might also be a strong \"return to work\" boost in sales because enterprise's have been using services like Teams and Zoom while WFH, but as employees return to the office they will need to adopt a digital device rather than the traditional desktop anal log phone.\n\nThe ticket used to be called PLT and I bought it cause I thought it was Palantir. I actually made quite a bit of money (\\~$200 / 25% return) So I decided to up the ante and try and play earnings and got completely slaughtered.\n\nI've already lost the money, so this post isn't about trying to salvage those 8/20 calls I'm down 98% on. I just want to try and put my reasons for investing in this company out here for you wise men and retards at WSB to try and ask you, where did I go wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mfuvq47751i71.png?width=259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a29152ed092c676a067e3d9a18a370cabd2adf82\n\nNeil Armstrong said the first words on the Moon with a Plantronics headset. So when we Moon, I recommend POLY. I use them at work, they are great quality, (but expensive). POLY's main source of revenue is enterprise communications device sales.\n\nI'm thinking that POLY will see a Return To Work boost. I don't think companies will go back to using analog devices. Many companies have been using Teams, Zoom, etc. to accommodate people working from home. Back in the early days, people just went on Amazon and bought whatever cheap USB / Bluetooth mic they could. POLY does not focus on the consumer device level, so unfortunately they did not profit from WFH. But when people start to come back to the office they will find themselves needing a new headset so they can communicate on Teams or Zoom. I guess they could dial in with their traditional office phone, but I don't think people will want to go back to doing that. As enterprises place orders for new Bluetooth and digital devices I envision they will stick with Plantronics.\n\nAfter the Q1 22' earnings and subsequent guidance for Q2, the stock is currently down about 14%. Even though the guidance was not really bad news with both revenue and EPS forecast to increase.\n\nI think there is room for a lot of room for upside with this company. They are making inroads into enterprise video devices (94% increase yoy). The chip shortage is improving, so Plantronics' gross margins will improve significantly. Finally, they have a new CEO who seems like a cool guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Q1 22' Financial summary](https://preview.redd.it/5kitkp3951i71.png?width=1485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7236d941d0548efcedfda5caff153e92ee3f89b8)\n\n[Revenue breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/son0qh0a51i71.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9a67d9b9b275aadea3fc8127c3d93f360a77f9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Q2 22' Guidance](https://preview.redd.it/bu5e4efc51i71.png?width=1460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d94627e6497906ca717c028211db28a27385b28)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Stock price over the last 10 years](https://preview.redd.it/blvm6zpd51i71.png?width=1257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1abbd83ce2d97b4ca84f9c871c5a15a22ebad06e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[New CEO \\(Sept 2020\\) with lots of communications experience](https://preview.redd.it/76eu060f51i71.png?width=316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3148421387385da2db3ebcfda1236817a63a2e27)\n\nThis is my first DD post.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 13, 2021**\n\nStocks rose modestly in another very choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) narrowly eking out fresh intraday record highs. The Nasdaq (QQQ) remain just a tick below its previous all-time high. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings data and new economic reports.\n\nYesterday\u2019s Weekly Unemployment report showed a third straight drop in filings, an encouraging sign that the recovery in the labor market continues. The report showed new unemployment claims coming in at 375,000, in-line with analyst estimates. Continuing claims came in at 2.866 million, better than the 2.9 million expected and 2.980 million the week prior. \n\nThe Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June\u2019s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nCore CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June\u2019s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June\u2019s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it\u2019s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It\u2019s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. \n\nOn the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The producer price index for final demand increased at a 7.8% pace for the 12 months ended July, according to the Labor Department. The July print was faster than the 7.3% pace recorded in June and ahead of the 7.3% rate expected. Prices rose 1% in July, matching the increase in June and higher than the 0.6% increase expected. \n\nEarlier in the week, the US Senate passed the $1 trillion infrastructure deal in a surprisingly bipartisan manner. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, \u201cThis historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you\u2019ve been asking for for a long, long time.\u201d Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared \u201c100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration\u201d said of the deal, \u201cI was proud to support today\u2019s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.\u201d The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc have asked the U.S. government for approval to operate a new undersea data cable between the Philippines and California after China Mobile agreed to exit the plan, a government agency said Friday. The companies told the Federal Communications Commission they intend to start commercial operation by late 2022 and said the new data connection will \"provide significant new capacity on routes where capacity demand continues to increase substantially each year.\"\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) gapped up 5% premarket before losing steam throughout the session to close roughly 1% higher\n* Tesla (TSLA) battery supplier CATL said it plans to sell $9 billion in stock to help boost manufacturing capacity. \n* So far, 91% of S&amp;P 500 components have reported actual second-quarter earnings, with 87% of these having topped Wall Street's estimates, according to data from FactSet. Assuming this proportion holds through the end of earnings season, it would mark the greatest share of earnings beats ever recorded in FactSet data spanning back to 2008. \n* Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell once again after founder Sir Richard Branson disclosed that he sold more than 10 million shares for about $300 million. His remaining stake is 46 million shares, roughly $1.2 billion.\n* Prices for [U.S. imports increased](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-import-price-increases-slow-125204156.html) at a slower than expected rate in July, signaling that supply chain constraints may have begun to ease as the economic recovery continued. \n* Import prices rose 0.3% in July compared to June, Commerce Department data showed on Friday. This was well below the 0.6% rise expected, and slowed notably from June's 1.0% monthly increase. \n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Airbnb (ABNB) with four price target increases following earnings.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 19, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed today in a choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recovering some losses after yesterday\u2019s session, closing 0.17% and 0.47% higher respectively. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly, closing 0.18% down while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued underperforming, closing 1.21% down today and almost 5% down this week. Market participants continue to digest the implication of the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Meeting Minutes, which showed there are increasing discussions surrounding a potential taper timeline, with members suggesting they could begin this year if the current pace of economic recovery continues.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. \n\nYesterday\u2019s meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nToday, the Labor Department released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which, along with other recent reports, vindicates the Fed\u2019s assessment that the labor market has substantially recovered from heights of the pandemic-induced recession. Initial Unemployment claims came in at 348,000, the lowest level since March 2020 and better than the 364,000 expected and 377,000 the previous week. Continuing claims came in at 2.82 million, roughly in line with the 2.8 million expected\n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, \u201cA couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.\u201d\n\nOn inflation, the minutes said \u201cWith regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory\u201d and \u201cSome other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound.\u201d However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.\n\nIn short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, \u201cA few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.\u201d\n\nI recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it's really not that long and super insightful: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In more earnings news, shares of Robinhood (HOOD) fell 10% after reporting earnings while my favorite stock Nvidia (NVDA) rose 4% after smashing earnings estimates and raising guidance moving ahead.\n* The Nigerian government said it expected to lift its ban on Twitter (TWTR) by the end of the year.\n* The SEC charged 3 former Netflix (NFLX) employees and two of their associates for insider trading accumulating $3 million.\n* The Federal Trade Commission filed a new version of its antitrust lawsuit against Facebook (FB) on Thursday, seeking to jump-start its case with bolstered allegations that the company is abusing a monopoly position in social media.\n* Tesla (TSLA) is holding an event, billed AI Day, in order to promote and showcase its AI technology.

        "selftext": "tl;dr - Plantronics makes communication devices like headsets. 2022 FYQ2 guidance (particularly with respect to the chip shortage) has disproportionately lowered the price of the stock. There might also be a strong \"return to work\" boost in sales because enterprise's have been using services like Teams and Zoom while WFH, but as employees return to the office they will need to adopt a digital device rather than the traditional desktop anal log phone.\n\nThe ticket used to be called PLT and I bought it cause I thought it was Palantir. I actually made quite a bit of money (\\~$200 / 25% return) So I decided to up the ante and try and play earnings and got completely slaughtered.\n\nI've already lost the money, so this post isn't about trying to salvage those 8/20 calls I'm down 98% on. I just want to try and put my reasons for investing in this company out here for you wise men and retards at WSB to try and ask you, where did I go wrong?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0aex8uvr0i71.png?width=259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d52d00fb78250b9f9db8d1956d59e2a930f9df\n\n[Plantronics Site](https://www.poly.com/us/en)\n\nQ1 2022' [Earnings &amp; Financials](https://s25.q4cdn.com/748803619/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Q1'22-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf) &amp; [Earnings Presentation](https://s25.q4cdn.com/748803619/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Q1'22-Earnings-Presentation-FINAL.pdf)\n\nNeil Armstrong said the first words on the Moon with a Plantronics headset. So when we Moon, I recommend POLY. I use them at work, they are great quality, (but expensive). POLY's main source of revenue is enterprise communications device sales. \n\nI'm thinking that POLY will see a Return To Work boost. I don't think companies will go back to using analog devices. Many companies have been using Teams, Zoom, etc. to accommodate people working from home. Back in the early days, people just went on Amazon and bought whatever cheap USB / Bluetooth mic they could. POLY does not focus on the consumer device level, so unfortunately they did not profit from WFH. But when people start to come back to the office they will find themselves needing a new headset so they can communicate on Teams or Zoom. I guess they could dial in with their traditional office phone, but I don't think people will want to go back to doing that. As enterprises place orders for new Bluetooth and digital devices I envision they will stick with Plantronics.\n\nAfter the Q1 22' earnings and subsequent guidance for Q2, the stock is currently down about 14%. Even though the guidance was not really bad news with both revenue and EPS forecast to increase.\n\nI think there is room for a lot of room for upside with this company. They are making inroads into enterprise video devices (94% increase yoy). The chip shortage is improving, so Plantronics' gross margins will improve significantly. Finally, they have a new CEO who seems like a cool guy. \n\n[Q1 22' Financial summary](https://preview.redd.it/k1ejyslio0i71.png?width=1485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=608652920555e74ce4be133889f2a63adfef5508)\n\n[Revenue breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/sdxpo9cyn0i71.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=605ed274c05b9d70910773af6dc3104a5a2e17e1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Q2 22' Guidance](https://preview.redd.it/piednwe4z0i71.png?width=1460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa794fbcd6df749799608e1d1d8cd81e2d08be5d)\n\n[Stock price over the last 10 years](https://preview.redd.it/qy60rsrrb0i71.png?width=1257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a95c10c82cbd1a6e97aae05527bed9a459b3542)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[New CEO \\(Sept 2020\\) with lots of communications experience](https://preview.redd.it/mnaq493iq0i71.png?width=316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36ee334dd100d721739dd6f642736a507abda2ea)\n\nThis is my first DD post.
