        "selftext": "There's still so many people using Robinhood after all the GME crap. And what really blows my mind is that I see people here on this very sub using Robinhood everyday? It absolutely baffles the living shit out of me as to why you are still using something that screwed you over, especially knowing very well that it could happen again and screw you over AGAIN. I don't want to see anyone who gets screwed over by Robinhood yet again complaining about it. You asked for it buddy.\n\nI know you stock market types only care about profit but godamn what kind of abusive relationship is this. This is mainly why I switched to the other market and projects like Merrymen who aim to undo this shit. What kind of abusive relationship do you people have with Robinhood. They give you a slick UI and you forget about all the wrongs they did to you? bruh.",

        "selftext": "Here it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade stocks:\n\n- $20k\n- $10k\n- $6k from my girlfriend\n- $4k from credit cards\n- some savings from my regular job\n\nThe reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing (the loans were not taken all at once). At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.\n\nWhen GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.\n\nSince that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.\n\nBottom line: I extinguished all my loans BUT $27k I owe the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even (monthly expenses + loan rate). If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700 monthly expenses.\n\nHowever, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?\n\nThanks!",

After several weeks of thoughtful consideration and research, I have finally made a decision to...\n\n\\[Double down\\](https://imgur.com/a/zlXWOOh) on my bet, like any decent retard residing in this cozy place would do.\n\nBut first things first, let's revise the original bet, \\[the underlying post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/).\n\n(I\u2019m not a financial advisor, just a retard who enjoys writing big texts and making risky bets)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter I. The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:\n\n*Processing img 5sldutzq33j71...*\n\nThe thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n*Processing img h7b6sm9t43j71...*\n\n*Processing img iz041qtv43j71...*\n\n  \n\\[The OC post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n*Processing img ncwwuqz253j71...*\n\n  \nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n*Processing img 58sg96eg53j71...*\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\n*Processing img nltp4a1l53j71...*\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\n*Processing img 44m2qp2q53j71...*\n\n  \nWhat you see above is the screenshot from \\[my other post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme\\_to\\_amc\\_and\\_bb\\_last\\_week\\_ladies\\_go\\_first\\_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it\u2019s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:\n\n*Processing img klztgzo563j71...*\n\nAs you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a \u2018memestonk\u2019? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **\u03c3 (sigma)** and **\u03b2 (beta**).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a \\[Bloomberg article\\](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n&gt;A \u201cblack swan\u201d event \u2014 made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life \u2014 comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren\u2019t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A \u201cfive-sigma event\u201d is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\n  \nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.  \n\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\n*Processing img 47plfcth63j71...*\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&amp;P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets\u2019 health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  \n\n\n&gt;2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n&gt;The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n*Processing img enhgxe0773j71...*\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\n*Processing img 2pb2k9qv63j71...*\n\nThis represents what Buffet called \u201cA Time Bomb\u201d in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n*Processing img xct7amb273j71...*\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n*Processing video 1rflh5jy33j71...*\n\n  \n\\*\\*In Tyler\u2019s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n*Processing img f9xgxitt73j71...*\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn\u2019t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what\u2019s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang\u2019s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I\u2019m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: \u2018Stonks only go up\u2019. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\n*Processing img zfh3tjyk83j71...*\n\n&gt;Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can\u2019t live without the always following stimulus \u201cdose\u201d. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we\u2019ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:  \n\n\n&gt;**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it\u2019s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\n*Processing img nw7vw0dk93j71...*\n\n*Processing img ebo8be5r93j71...*\n\n*Processing img kqwqmy9t93j71...*\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man\u2019s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it\u2019s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there\u2019s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that\u2019s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it\u2019s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that\u2019s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the \u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 movie? Oh,  \n\n\n&gt;It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n  \n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I\u2019m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn\u2019t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\n*Processing video m0gwzvob43j71...*\n\n**And here is why I\u2019m so confident in my bet and its timing:**  \n\n\n*Processing img w51ks5l2b3j71...*\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the\\_big\\_short\\_20\\_why\\_bears\\_may\\_soon\\_reconsider/), and \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this\\_time\\_its\\_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n*Processing img mcg9etbeh3j71...*\n\n*Processing img xbskfzdkh3j71...*\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**",

It's in business since 1994\n\n\\- It's growing revenue every year. 2018: $937M, 2019: $1,097M, 2020: $1,700M and TTM: $2,015M\n\n\\- It's profitable, with a profit margin of 8%\n\n\\- It's growing income every year: 2018: $22M, 2019: $24M, 2020: $158M and TTM: $211M\n\n\\- They have positive cash flow and are sitting on $136M of cash. TTM free cash flow is $138M.\n\n\\- With 91M shares outstanding, this means that they could, theoretically, start paying a dividend of $1 per share without running in debt (which many other companies do). That's a 4% dividend yield for a growing company.\n\nIn short, many money, good money \ud83d\udcb5 \ud83d\udcb5 \ud83d\udcb5\n\n**Share price:**\n\nat time of writing, price is hovering around 25,6, that's more than 40% lower from ATHs.Their P/E ratio is 16. Current S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio is 34.\n\nLook at this beautiful graph and be amazed by my paint skills: there was a strong $30 support until WSB came in with a short pump, after that the price has been regularly falling.\n\n[CRSR Stock Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bgknz7eshi71.jpg?width=1489&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14dac94257d5650bae110fea236e05c225097151)\n\nMy take on this is:\n\n\\- Some boring cuck institutional investors are pulling back and waiting to add more shares. They don't like owning volatile stocks subjects to pumps etc. I will be inserting myself in this sweet stock while they watch from the corner of the room, like the good cucks that they are.\n\n\\- Employees and Eagle Tree Capital are selling their shares. They got in pre-ipo, so they are still making a good profit at the price of $25. Some of them are paper-handing it and taking profit. Pathetic.\n\nI know we hate GME comparisons but let's just fantasize for a second:look how after the squeeze, the price kept falling for a while, until it found some volume and skyrocketed back up, to never fall to those levels again.\n\n[GME Stock Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/q8d15vmhshi71.jpg?width=1507&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce317857fab1e769558fb80562eb72f3c12b556d)\n\nIn short, apes go to moon \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Other catalysts:**\n\n\\- Gaming industry is booming and in case of another lockdown you know what happens\n\n\\- Chip shortage means that the sales that we are seeing now are not at full potential- Institutions buying in. At the moment Eagle Tree Capital is still the majority shareholder, after cutting it's position from 92% to 58%. Most other institutions have just a small position (see picture below).\n\n\\- Acquisitions. Turtle beach company ($HEAR) was priced around $25 when one of their shareholders proposed acquiring the full stake at $36,5 per share. That's a 46% premium. The company board refused, clearly understanding that the market is underpricing these companies.\n\n[Institutional Ownerhip](https://preview.redd.it/3oq48z2kshi71.jpg?width=1036&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c53cb07d1eeb855102f243a5d89b0a63a8640f3)\n\nPositions:\n\n200 Shares at 30;\n\n2x 21 jan 2022 calls, strike 30;\n\n11x cash covered puts at various strikes (25; 27,5; 40)\n\nIt took me 1 hour to type all of this and paint the not-so-straight lines, so please at least tell me to go get fked by my wife's bf.  \n\n\n**EDIT!**  \nI haven't mentioned anywhere about the 20% short interest in CRSR and how Citadel is the main  \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b shorting it  \n \n\n[Citadel Shorting 33M of CRSR](https://preview.redd.it/i7m08lhm4ji71.png?width=1381&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52624362b6b707884c3ee391b3aa8571cf392c09)\n\nJust for reference, GME short interest was 30% in February 2021.",

        "selftext": "I'm not sure whether if it is appropriate to write a post about this topic on r/stocks, but I want to hear your opinions. If the post is inappropriate to write on this subreddit, please let me know.\n\nI'm a junior student living in Seoul, South Korea. And in my experience, I think it's nearly impossible to make a living out of ordinary income in this city. Everything is expensive here. While I'm expected to receive about $2300(thinking of becoming a police officer) per month as a starting salary,  the average monthly rent for a studio apartment in Seoul exceeds $800\\~$1000. Considering the living expenses and miscellaneous expenditures, it's nearly impossible to make a save money. Now I'm quite panicking about my future.\n\nAnyway, so I started investing since I was a high school student. I've done a lot of mistakes(including investment in GME) but in the end, I realized that it is important to make a sustainable investment. But considering my lack of investment budget, I'm confused about whether I should be more aggressive and either leverage my bank account or invest in high-volatility stocks. Or even invest in futures or options.\n\nMy ultimate dream is to have a $2M\\~$4M amount of assets before the age of 40\\~45, but it seems like a high hope to me. If you were in my position, what would you do? What should I do?",

        "selftext": "Hey Everyone, it's u/nobjos back with this week's analysis!  \n\n**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -&gt; What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&amp;text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rrgu9o8705g71.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781036d4ac5a896c8ed5bf391b623255f1f5898a)\n\nS&amp;P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/32eyi1hb05g71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet\u2019s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&amp;P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&amp;P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n&gt;A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don\u2019t completely agree with this view that it\u2019s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&amp;P 500\u2018s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/hoiy89zc05g71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/gre25fff05g71.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66cda7571f6f8a3ffe63e9f6ea12d2700523fc83)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&amp;P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry\u2019s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&amp;P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100\u2019s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don\u2019t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI\u2019s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI\u2019s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let\u2019s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you\u2019ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it\u2019s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.\n\n\\[8\\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor!",

        "selftext": " Sup Retards  \n\nI am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the state police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with an rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brothers insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.  \n\nIn that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to \u201claunder\u201d my brother\u2019s $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling \u201cbuy and hold\u201d while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That\u2019s when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.  \n\nWith our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pd), praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.  \n\nIn all sincerity, from what I\u2019ve read thus far, I\u2019ve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven\u2019t read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an \u201curban disaster,\u201d and a \u201ccomplete shithole.\u201d Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can\u2019t read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.  \n\nI know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that\u2019s not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there\u2019s some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and \u201cIndian Land\u201d management. It so happens that a section of North America\u2019s largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.  \n\nI\u2019m not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE\u2014in fact the last thing I want is pt Wallstreetbets ganging up on CLNE again. You people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.  \n\nFor those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *\u201cClean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*\u201d They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comprable to diesl, and the also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what other retard\u2019s High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn\u2019t do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE \u2013 that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal support is good for CLNE.  \n\n**Infrastructure Bill** **&amp; CLNE DD**\n\nOverall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and12 pt hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, support for labor. It\u2019s unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.  \n\nHere are some highlights from the [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cms-energy-corp-cms-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript-2021-07-29) which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Increasing supply while in talks with \u201cdozens of dairies\u201d sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.)     \n \n* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.  \n \n* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today\u2019s growing demand.  \n \n* Increasing customers in New York,  Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and Amazon.    \n \n* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.  \n \n* Electric \tand hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by \tinfrastructure and mineral resources. Using the s California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \\[an \texample\\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon \treduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.  \n \n* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.  \n \n\nContent pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 16 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, \tmethane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.  \n \n* Some related grants have requirements such as must be \u201cregionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable\u201d which fits CLNE current business perfectly.    \n \n* \u201cAppalachian regional energy hub initiative\u201d  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to \tindividuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and \tactivities, at will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)  \n \n* $52,488,065,375 \tthrough 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.    \n \n* Massive \tamounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The \tentire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially \u201cSubtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,\u201d as \tRNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it \tspecifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it\u2019s easy to see CLNE taking advantage.     \n \n\nWhether it\u2019s intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair\u2019s language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bills language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.  \n\n**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**\n\nI bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including \u201cmy brother,\u201d lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.\n\nInstead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we\u2019re the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about how a virus is going to kill everyone if we don\u2019t take a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son\u2019s laptop?\n\nAs culturally enriching as the president\u2019s son\u2019s DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn\u2019t want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.  \n\nThe earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, \u201cexcluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nThis is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he\u2019s retarded, but because he\u2019s a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don\u2019t think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair\u2019s cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it\u2019s consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without CVOVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it\u2019s going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it\u2019s bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.  \n\nAt 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don\u2019t really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn\u2019t really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.  \n\nI\u2019m now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them in to CLNE shares every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it\u2019s easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if i were to place a relatively placid bet.",

I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features.\n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\nPrior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.\n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.\n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\nAt that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[My Ford Forecast illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/4cwxwa68rrg71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d66883a4eddd06a88a5799b3a19095280b050f4)",

I support GME both AMC and GME. Full disclosure I am not the first to point out these similarities but I have looked into them myself using the charts I pulled off of the SEC Website. AL Trades is where I first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and I just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided. \n\nLooking at the Charts you see peaks in FTDs in Both GME and AMC before the price run up. **FOR GME HAPPENED 3 TIMES and THE FTD PATTERN HAS AN ERIE CORRELATION THE SHARE PRICE IMO.** \n\nThe Peak FTDs for GME were just over 3m and GMEs Float is 56m according to Google\n\n3m FTDs / 56m Shares = just over 5% of the float \n\nThe Peak FTDs for AMC were just over 27M and the float according to google is 511m\n\n27m FTDs / 511m Shares = Just over 5% of the Float \n\nThe Peak FTDs for CLOV were just over 19m and the Float according to Google is 133M\n\n19m FTD\u2019s / 133m Shares = **Just over 14%**!\n\nAnother thing I want to point out is that AMC before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from CLOV in June. \n\nAMC went from around $2 to $20 then back down to $6 \n\nCLOV went from $6 to $28 and is now in the $8 range which it has been for a couple of weeks now. Is the Bottom in for CLOV? I don\u2019t really know but I hope so. \n\n**Full disclosure I am a CLOV shareholder and very bullish on CLOV from all of My research I have done and that others have done.** \n\n**I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. Just pointing out some things I see from the Charts.** \n\n**I hope that everybody does they\u2019re own due diligence before investing and hope that everybody makes some money investing.** \n\n**If you don\u2019t like this post, please provide some constructive feedback and specific reasons why.** \n\n**Last but not least LFG GME AMC AND CLOV.**",

        "selftext": "All year for about 13 months now I've  been heavy on growth. I've come close to my position nearly doubling in value, and then lost all my profits in February. Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.\n\nI have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.\n\n\nI recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. \n\nI'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. \n\nI sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)\n\nI made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.\n\n\nJust wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.\n\n\nI am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.\n\n\nMy advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.\n\n\nLove to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..\n\nBTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well.

        "selftext": "**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -&gt; What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&amp;text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zy80c4kttbg71.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22edbacdeeeab17670d3eaba794fffc867f1c41f)\n\nS&amp;P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/5z8phclwtbg71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet\u2019s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&amp;P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&amp;P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n&gt;A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don\u2019t completely agree with this view that it\u2019s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&amp;P 500\u2018s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/vpb5klt1ubg71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/evh5eqm3ubg71.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae3ca2caa10241fdec61f39801c45b7c14fce6cf)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&amp;P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry\u2019s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&amp;P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100\u2019s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don\u2019t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI\u2019s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI\u2019s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let\u2019s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you\u2019ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it\u2019s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.\n\n\\[8\\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor!",

Like GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) back in January, Clover\u2019s underlying statistics appeal to retail traders looking to squeeze short sellers:\n\nSmall Float: Clover has a relatively small float of just 112.38 million shares.\nOwnership Levels: Clover has an unbelievable 119.64% of its float tied up in the hands of insiders and institutions with 95.06% of its shares held by institutions and 24.58% by insiders.\nShort Interest: 25.26 million shares, meaning 22.47% of its total float, is held short although this number has dropped from 35.89 million in June.\nSee Also: How to Buy Clover Health Stock\n\nThe Clover Health Chart: After Clover\u2019s parabolic run in June the stock sold off over 72% and found a bottom at the $7.84 mark. For the past 20 trading days, Clover has held above the level and traded in a tight sideways pattern under $8.99.\n\nThere has been low volume in Clover\u2019s stock during the sideways trading, indicating a lack of both sellers and buyers. Often when a security\u2019s volume drops off for an extended period of time, either huge bearish or bullish volume comes in to break it from the sideways pattern.\n\nClover closed Wednesday just below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, which is bearish. If Clover trades above the $8.70 area on Thursday it will be above both commonly followed EMAs and the short-term sentiment will be bullish.\n\nThe 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a tool used to measure overall sentiment in a stock, is at about the $10.50 area. If Clover trades below the SMA, overall sentiment is bearish; if the stock is able to clear the level, the sentiment will shift to bullish.\u201d \n\n\nIn other words. CLOV to fucking space.

        "selftext": "\nA few months ago, I became excited about the realm that was stocks and investing. I saw explosion of meme stocks that was AMC and GME and couldn\u2019t get wait to get on. I put a small amount of money into crypto and onto stocks. Then I left my investing accounts alone for a bit. \n\nEvery month I would use DCA and buy some crypto and put a little more in stocks. My portfolio was selling coming together but it was literal pennies to what happened later. This month I would make a series of options that bought my portfolio from 300 to 3000. I was ecstatic, that was bigger than any paycheck I gotten so far. $3000 is chump changed and I planned on getting that to 30k by the end of the year. \n\nI didn\u2019t see how I was slowly falling into gambling. There was no excuse. I\u2019m didn\u2019t understand the greeks, IV. Yes I know how stupid I am and how that sounds. I would flip a coin and bet with my greedy ass head, not understanding the fundamentals well enough nor do tying to learn it. Last week I made one bad call and got burnt hard.  I got desperate, I began revenge trading and chasing my losses rather than just moving on. 0DTE calls. Increasingly riskier positions. I would be too easily effected by my emotions and would spend hours glued on my phone, watching as my account bled red. As gamblers fallacy, I bet the last remaining of my buying power on a Hail Mary. (AMC) Yes, roast me and burn me on a stake that\u2019s what I did. \n\nBut it worked! I had gained 56% of my losses back, yet I wasn\u2019t content. I wanted to wipe away all my losses and I held. Held to the point where my account got wiped out and I lost 75% of my portfolio. It\u2019s here that realized that I was doing. I was on verge of liquidating all my stocks and withdrawing more money to gain my losses. I knew then I had to stop. \n\nI\u2019m not broke, I don\u2019t know anyone money nor do I have major financial obligations. I have my parents who support me through everything I do. I\u2019m getting a new job next week. Why am I writing this? I guess as a reflection as my short descent into a near gambler. I\u2019m not smarter than the market nor should one every skip the fundamentals of the market. ESPECIALLY for something like options. I had no exit strategy nor risk management. I am happy that I was able to grow my account 10x in less than a month. However 3k in the grand scheme is nothing. I\u2019m taking this time to understand and work on my weakness. I want to hug my parents and tell them I\u2019ll do better. I\u2019m going to deactivate my trading account and focus on learning and building up my capital before I tamper with the market again. A painful lesson but one I felt like I needed. \n\nTLDR; Dumb kid with beginner luck thinks he\u2019s better than the market and nearly loses it all.",

        "selftext": " A few housekeeping items first. \n\nBack in the $GME heyday, a user by the name of [/u/indonesian\\_activist](https://www.reddit.com/u/indonesian_activist/) made a series of Gamma squeeze calculators, with version numbers, changelogs and the whole shebang. I'm not that excel savvy, so this is simply version 2 that he made that I am using now for $CLOV (he got to v.8 with $GME). So shoutout to him for allowing me to use his work and post this here for $CLOV.\n\nThose of you who already know what gamma squeezes are can skip the first two bullet points if you want.  \n\n\n* As a lot of you know, there is HUGE amounts of Open Interest in CLOV Call options next week. What not as many of you know, I presume, is that the market makers themselves are the ones buying and selling a lot of the call and put options. Contrary to popular belief, they aren't picking sides (at least not in this instance) and simply want to remain Delta neutral, that is, balanced in their risk.\n* As such, this can lead to what is called a Gamma squeeze. Market makers are forced to buy shares to cover their asses and remain delta neutral as the share price goes up. This, of course, increases buying pressure which can then lead to even higher prices, triggering more call options to be in the money, and it becomes a self-sustaining process until it hits the top of the option chain (if there are sufficient amounts of Open Interest).\n* This week (8/13) is a typical week, where we have about 32,000 call options and 8,300 put options. Next week 8/20 is a big monthly options expiration date, however, coming shortly after earnings are released, which means a LOT of options are bought. How many? How about 278,000 call options and 70,500 put options! These are \\*INCREDIBLE\\* numbers for a stock with a float of 112,000,000 shares. It's almost 10x the amount of options as a typical week! Triggering many of these strike prices would cause a gamma squeeze due to millions and millions of shares needing to be bought!\n* This leads me to the spreadsheet calculator. I don't have a great way of sharing it with you in an editable format, other than if you download the spreadsheet to Excel and run it there. If you are afraid of macros and malware, I don't blame you, don't download it if you don't want to. You can just look through the screenshots and viewable spreadsheet link here. I will link to the spreadsheet below, where you can view the data, and download the spreadsheet to play around with if you want to.\n* This data is good for tomorrow 8/10 only. The spreadsheet needs to be updated daily, as the numbers obviously change quickly, especially with options that expire soon. When the spreadsheet shows how many shares the MM's (market makers) need to buy, it means how many they need to buy for that day and immediately, IF the stock is at the projected price I input. For example, here are how many shares they need to buy if we hit $9 tomorrow, $10, $11, $12, and $15. If people are interested, I can attempt to post these daily with the updated numbers. The main thing to look at in these screenshots is the Net Buy needed by Evil MM's. In this first screenshot, it shows 1,139,848 shares needing be purchased and the percentage of the entire float (approx 112,000,000 shares) that represents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$9 target price on 8\\/10](https://preview.redd.it/9pbukvcjifg71.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f9c4a6cb3be06777de7c2002ca67c4157f7bfc9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$10 target price on 8\\/10](https://preview.redd.it/rt4rmwsuifg71.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dd66ba6f87f51819ce7854d6dce595b139fd153)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img due91rvrifg71...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$12 target price on 8\\/11](https://preview.redd.it/c7g2ltetifg71.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=330f4a475352d6054a1aecb6bb8057291ba2c318)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$15 target price on 8\\/11](https://preview.redd.it/ey1ovqqxifg71.png?width=1189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb532ef752f483806c8bdb836b07ae69e3ac5c89)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* As you can see, the number of shares that would need to be purchased by MM's can be a runaway train with the right amount of pressure applied. We've seen how low the daily volume has gotten as of late, but also how quickly that volume goes up once the share price starts picking up a bit. (9MM volume last week vs 26M today) This is part of the reason why.\n* I have done my best to double-check all the numbers and equations on this spreadsheet, but again, I am not great with this stuff, and am only using tools others have built in the past. If you notice any errors affecting the data, please let me know. I have no problem admitting fault, and will edit this post or remove it outright if the data is wrong or misleading.\n* Last but not least here is the link to the spreadsheet. Again, you will need to download to Excel to use the scripts to make it work. Enjoy.[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xrFShr20I-C5aYGR8L7Znyqnq\\_uYYahAX2jSUBKaPA8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xrFShr20I-C5aYGR8L7Znyqnq_uYYahAX2jSUBKaPA8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTL;DR: Modest share price increase this week makes CLOV go brrrrrrt.\n\nLast but not least, buy and hold, I am not a financial analyst, do your own research, and let's fucking go my fellow CLOVers!",

Reaching returns of over 100% since March lows, it is time for this baby to start a correction. Looking like \"sell in September\" is going to be a real thing for all the boomers real soon. Looking at the chart below, it is only a matter of time before SPY decides to dump its pants. I'm not saying a recession type of drop, but at least a small correction.

BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little. It's almost like people are treating the meme stocks as safety for their cash because they have been pretty consistent with basically having a negative Beta. \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsnvy5bocej71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29185f1559ae2ef9819853b4f9bcb5a5890ccde\n\nIf you look at the chart below, this is the weekly chart showing the first and second meme pumps casually lifting off the long term trendline marked. The selling has dried up, and volume managed to enter at the right time to maintain our trend.

I know when my order was placed 9:42am(bid was 2.67), and at the price they executed it(3.75) i want to see what time it was executed.. they closed it out at 53.12 on Tuesday when GME spiked, so yeah a pretty big damn loss. \n\nDoes anyone know of a site with this data? I've been on the CBOE site but its really confusing if i buy the data with 1 minute intervals will that show trade executions.

        "selftext": "I apologize in advance for my terrible English, it is not my native language. I want to raise the FTD topic. The other day I had nothing to do and I started looking at all the stocks that had a short-squeeze this year. In addition to the GME and AMC (AMC - FTD 5.5%, and 3 months later a jump in the price of 3500%, GME - FTD 4,5%, after 2 months leap in price in 3000-4000%)\n\nWKHS: FTD 2%, and 2 months later a jump on 100%\n\nBBBY: FTD 1.7%, and after 3 months leap 300%\n\nPRTS: FTD-1.4%, after 3 months, a jump of 100%\n\nIn short, I sat like this, checked the companies, went through all the meme tickers of reddit, among other things. And at some point I caught myself that seeing the number of shares in FTD and the subsequent price jump after a while, I can roughly determine how many shares in the company are in circulation. And suddenly I guessed the approximate number of shares, well, give or take 20 million.\n\nAnd then I come to the palantir $ PLTR. I see that they had a jump in FTD of 20 million shares in February. But the price chart shows calm and silence. A huge number of shares in FTD and no impact on the price. I must admit, at that moment I was afraid. Did the theory fail? After all, in order for such a huge number of shares in FTD not to affect the price, the total number of shares in circulation should be huge. I looked at how many shares palantir has in turnover-1.8 billion, so FTD is about 1 percent, everything is fine.\n\nIn general, what I'm talking about: all companies whose FTD was at least about 2% had a jump after 2-4 months. In the case of GME and AMC and their FTD in the region of 5%, the growth was already in 3000-4000%. Oh, yes. Do you know what FTD CLOV had on July 8, to be precise? 12,8%. I will leave the conclusions to you, I will only say that I have not seen such a percentage in any company.\n\nSee for yourself how surprisingly the FTD chart and the price chart correlate\n\n[GME](https://preview.redd.it/08tu4vjtq5h71.jpg?width=1281&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84998519ce121e095c31eaa2813f44ae24f7576)\n\n[AMC](https://preview.redd.it/jb6nxuisq5h71.jpg?width=1487&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f1ac5b2faa741deed09701dc772af937656fc0)\n\n[WKHS](https://preview.redd.it/7ve3trerq5h71.jpg?width=1327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c25520667265563822bd45be01556a8ebc3009f2)\n\n[PRTS](https://preview.redd.it/1n4ql6dqq5h71.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418b5ee816d9cd01be854313cc584ff59652c72a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/g6l4024pq5h71.jpg?width=1320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ff362bffb0c0170e2a152ec8561a8d91df8746a)",

        "selftext": "## Introduction\n\nMartoma is born to Indian immigrant parents in Florida. Goes to Duke then gets into Harvard Law School. Gets kicked out of Harvard Law School for changing his grades, him \\*and his family\\* change their names and with his new name he finesses his way into Stanford Business School a year later.\n\nMartoma starts working for Steven A. Cohen at the infamous SAC Capital, and this is where he makes magic happen for a very short while, before getting caught. As an aside, it's weird to me that no news outlets have reported on his release since the prosecution of SAC Capital was so big at the time. \n\n## Mild connection to GameStop frenzy\n\nThe connection is not a big stretch IMO, basically the way my line of thinking works here is Mathew Martoma kept Steven A. Cohen (infamous for insider trading) out of jail by not throwing him under the bus. Cohen then mentors Gabe Plotkin and Gabe starts Melvin Capital. So, if Cohen was in jail then Melvin Capital would never have opened up shop, let alone be massively short GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's about it, some more details below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A bit more detail:\n\nMathew Martoma was behind one of the most profitable insider trading scandals in history with a profit of $276 million. \\[[link](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/02/07/former-sac-trader-found-guilty-insider-trading/6EIbg0eTH5Gawy2rnOBaFO/story.html)\\]\n\nMathew Martoma was quietly released from prison on July 19th on good behavior, according to his wiki page \\[[wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Martoma)\\]. I wasn't able to confirm it with any other news sources, but I did do an inmate search on him three weeks ago on [bop.gov](http://bop.gov/) (I've been following this dude's story for a while) and he came up then  \u2014  he doesn't come up anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## More detail about the GME connection\n\nGME had a high short interest which was a significant part of DFV's thesis \\[[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4)\\].\n\nOne of the biggest shorts (and losers) in this saga by dollar amount was  Melvin Capital (who have lost just over $5 billion YTD) and was later given $2.75BN just to keep running by Citadel and Steven A. Cohen \\[[link](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qm7508qzvkhd/Melvin-Capital-Added-to-GameStop-Shorts-as-WallStreetBets-Took-Aim)\\].\n\nMelvin Capital is run by Gabe Plotkin who was Steven A. Cohen's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.  No Cohen \u2192 No Plotkin \u2192 No Melvin \u2192 No massive GME short. Anecdotally, Plotkin actually overrode his analysts and himself made the decision to sell GME calls. \\[[link](https://twitter.com/goodalexander/status/1403342212180676609)\\]\n\n## Martoma's involvement with SAC Capital\n\nMathew Martoma made the insider trades using information about an Alzheimer's drug from two doctors \\[[link](https://annarborobserver.com/articles/the_corruption_of_sid_gilman_full_article.html)\\] including, a then professor at the University of Michigan, Sid Gilman.\n\nProsecutors find and grill Martoma to get Cohen, but Martoma doesn't give him up \\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/martoma-grain-sand-probe-sacs-010630030.html)\\]. Since they couldn't get Cohen, and there were no willing witnesses they went after the company itself and a few of the employees instead. If Martoma had given up Cohen then Cohen would be in prison and Melvin Capital would've never opened up shop.\n\n## Highlights from Martoma's life story\n\nMathew Martoma also has a little bit of an insane personal story (just lifting this off of wikipedia \\[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Martoma)\\] and Bloomberg \\[[link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-10/ex-sac-s-martoma-harvard-expulsion-revealed-on-trial-eve)\\]):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Born in Florida in 1974 to Indian immigrants as Ajai Mathew Mariamdani Thomas (note the different name)\n2. Graduates from a public high school in Florida and goes to Duke for (this is a good one) Biomedics, *Ethics*, and Public Policy\n3. Goes to Harvard Law School\n4. Is applying to a clerkship for a federal appeals (ironic) court judge and changes a couple Bs to As cuz fuck it why not\n5. Gets caught, tells the registrar at school it was all \"just a joke\" (direct quote)\n6. Gets kicked out of Harvard Law School, but appeals\n7. Appeal fails, Martoma gets kicked out of Harvard\n8. Spends a year volunteering\n9. Changes his name to Mathew Martoma, and from 1994 to 2001 his parents and both of his siblings also change their last name to Martoma. With his new name, he applies to and is accepted to Stanford Business School (what a fucking finesse holy shit).\n10. Does the insider trading deed, gets a \\~$9 million bonus in January 2009, fired for losing money in 2009 and 2010 and moves back to Florida\n11. Gets prosecuted and goes to jail sometime in the fall of 2014, also loses his Stanford MBA for having been admitted under false pretenses\n12. Released on good behavior on July 19, 2021",

        "selftext": "Did you come to Wallstreetbets today looking for a cure to ~~chlamydia~~ *your stupidity*? Well, look no further, friend! Using my masterful TA skills, I'm going to cure you of that burning sensation you get when you ~~pee~~ *look at your portfolio*! With this ***one simple trick***, all of your terrible life choices will resolve themselves into brilliant investment decisions! And for the first time ever: featuring a TL;DR on a Cbass post. Wow!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: We're all going to be rich\\* as fuck!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. Begun, the Meme Wars have\n\n1. GME\n2. AMC\n3. BB\n4. CLOV\n\nPart 2. The Voice of Alex Jones\n\nPart 3. A New Hope\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 1. Begun, the Meme Wars have**\n\nThis past week saw an appreciable awakening of the memes, particularly GME and AMC, with knock-on effects across the whole of the Meme-verse. This was followed by a sea of gain porn and concomitant conspiracy theories about insiders among us. \n\nWell, ol' Cbass is here to clear things up with Star Wars references, bad jokes, and even worse TA. So let's have us a gander at some magic space-wizard charts to answer the age old question: ***Am I going to lose all my money.... again?***\n\nStarting with the OG, GME:\n\n[We're comin' fer ya, hedgies! Reee!](https://preview.redd.it/1a4yyt2we6k71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ef8fcd2046ff1417684d4a52f17a0353ff02e03)\n\nAccording to my long since discarded thesis, GME was supposed to find support at the $218 level where the last breakout occurred (Launch #3). That failed worse than my last date, oh so many years ago. Then someone here claimed that the thin green uptrend line I've got on there was supposed to hold. That failboat sailed to a galaxy far, far away. But the #2b breakout line did, at last, managed to hold. And then we got a breakout of that nasty red downtrend this week and now we're trying, once more to breakout of of the #3 line. \n\nSo, does GME have it in itself to do enter hyperspace? Well, from a DD perspective earnings are coming up and that is probably going to spell doom or boom for the ticker. The company is in the midst of a turnaround, so it at least has a good story going for it (unlike anything Disney owns). \n\nFrom a TA perspective... well, to be honest, TA is just there so you can feel better or worse about your decision. It can't really predict all that much, except for after the fact. But it can give traders some piece of mind before the fact; a sort of all-clear that many need before jumping in a position. To that extent, getting out from under that downtrend was a big deal. From here, it's all on the shoulders of retail to initiate **Operation Bagholder Rescue**, if it is to happen at all. \n\n**Cbass's Call for GME:** I actually think you ~~retards~~ *brilliant, forward thinking investors* have it in you to break back over $218. Can you bust the $330 double top? I'm not so confident, but I'd be happily proven wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext up, an empty movie theater for a Disney Star Wars showing, AMC:\n\n[Supreme stupidity, in chart form](https://preview.redd.it/ja0puvoug6k71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab226485fe17812dfc4c94cd4d0d661d31d6eb56)\n\nMy previous thesis called for AMC to retrace to the #2a line, $14.54. Whelp, y'all decided to buy up the whole damn company and proceeded to prove me wrong. But in the true form of a TA Jedi Master, I've just *ex post facto* revised my thesis so that I'm still correct: Now I'm calling the May-June launch a Double-Event, so powerful it impregnated half the girls in Bangkok, because *reasons*. Accordingly, the settling at the #2b line is right in line with my \"original\" thesis. This is how it's done, young padawan.\n\nHaving found that support, this week saw AMC also breakout of a downtrend line. I've included a small uptrend channel that I saw on some other guy's AMC TA, and we've dropped back into that. Unlike GME, there is not a significant resistance line above the current position, which is nice. \n\nFrom a DD perspective, there is not much great to say about this company and \"fundamentals\" are doing nothing but holding the ticker back. Maybe if Disney hadn't fucked up Star Wars, there'd be some major films to fill the seats right now. Furthermore, management's penchant for stock sales and the possibility of more to come if you idiots actually moon this thing again *is not helping*. \n\n**Cbass's Call for AMC:** Skies look pretty clear to me; up is the direction. I wouldn't count on that channel lasting for too long, though. On the other hand, if you wunderkinds *can't* get this thing to moon, gravity will ruin your day, week, month, year, and for some of you extra special ones: *your entire financial future*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, a company somehow survived irrelevancy, BB:\n\n[Extra \\\\\"special\\\\\" line drawing skills here](https://preview.redd.it/o39cqkfcj6k71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a723faac2fda7a0dfffd6e5248d5665bac3f7b8)\n\nJust like GME, BB failed to settle at the previous breakout line (#3), and instead decided you fuckers needed the ***executive tour*** of the S&amp;M dungeon before finally settling around $9.50. BB has since broken out of *two* down trend lines! That means it's going to moon twice as hard, bro! You can readjust line #3 so it's at $11.56 or so, and then it looks like this past week's action tested and failed that line, just like was the case for GME. Indeed, from a chart-perspective GME and BB are the most closely aligned (with BBBY being a somewhat retarded cousin that ~~I've~~ *everyone has* given up talking about). \n\nFrom the DD perspective, apparently BB has some magic AI shit going for it and it's related to security and cars and shit. Whatever, just sounds like Cathie Woodisms to me, but such platitudes are the nectar of the masses and if that gets 'em to buy, who fuckin' cares. \n\nOn the TA side, this is in the same boat as GME. You've got to at least break over $11.50 to stand a chance. Over that, the skies are clear for a run into the twenties and that'll be enough for the gamblers to start hurling YOLO's at it once more. \n\n**Cbass's Call on BB**: Up if GME goes up. Sideways or down otherwise. This one's not going to move independent of Big Daddy. It's also not going to move as hard because of the large free float. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, the little brother that your mom made to take to the party and is now embarrassing you in front of the hot chicks, CLOV:\n\n[No, CLOV, you were supposed to be the Chosen One. Not ruin my portfolio!](https://preview.redd.it/45d9m8f9m6k71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a3985c252a10b333677c7749da916ebf1b6f171)\n\nNow, I know some of you are thinking: CLOV? What the fuck? CLOV doesn't belong on this list. It belongs on the list with WISH, WKHS and all that other garbage. And you'd be right to think that. But I still own CLOV, and it is ***technically*** not dead. It's just ***mostly dead***, and if you've seen the Princess Bride, you know that mostly dead has a cure.... unlike my stupidity. In addition, CLOV has been hovering near the top of the sentiment lists for some time, so there's that.\n\nLike the others above, CLOV has broken out of downtrend, or possibly two (I was generous with that second, orange line). However, unlike BB or GME, CLOV is nowhere near its prior breakout level. Indeed, the $9 mark is proving to be an impenetrable barrier. We might actually need a Zombie Dragon to take that fucker down. On the good side of the TA, the \\~$8 line is proving to be the actually bottom.\n\nOn the DD side, CLOV had its earnings and they were wholly unimpressive. The clovtards dug deep to find the nuggets of good, but the overall market said, \"Yeah, nah bitch,\" and slapped it back down with an extra helping of pimp-hand. \n\n**Cbass's Call for CLOV:** It exists to fuck up my yearly P/L, but if GME and AMC can take off, they'll carry CLOV and its whole clown army up with them. Problem is, there's no imminent breakout overhead. We've got to go up a ways before any true breakout can be attempted. Which means unless we get a truly epic launch of the whole Meme Space Force, CLOV has the potential to get shot down before ever getting back up to the high teens, let alone the twenties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2. The Voice of Alex Jones**\n\nIt's conspiracy theory time! Yayy! \n\nSo the voice of Alex Jones came to me in a dream the other night and it got me wondering: Is this whole endeavor an elaborate trap to ensnare idiot retail traders into terrible options that are certain to expire worthless? Let's look at the evidence. \n\nFirst, we didn't get any breakouts until after the 8/20 expiry. Together with the 7/16 expiry, this represented (I believe) a ***massive*** chunk of options. I saw this regarding CLOV, and I suspect it is a similar story for GME, AMC and BB, and a whole host of other 'meme stocks.'\n\nSecond, I'm *quite sure* at this point that Big Money is behind the Jedi Options Wizardry that causes these massive spikes. Originally, I thought that this was just a Big Money vs. Big Money game and we were naught but pawns in their schemes. \n\nNow... I'm beginning to think ~~aliens~~ ***the House*** is in on it. Basically, they are going to let/help the meme stock launches in order to rope a bunch of idiots into buying shitty options. Particularly, those who buy them of the downslope of the spikes, hoping for a quick rebound. Those options are going to be easy to kill and the House can clean up. \n\nBut they'll never get the chance if the whole meme stock \"movement\" dies a slow death. It is only by hanging a line out, enticing the morons with dreams of easy money and fast cars and loose women that they can get y'all to bite in large enough numbers. Basically, the sight of those big green dildos is impossible to resist and FOMO takes over and you dipshits buy options that are all but DoA.\n\n**So, is this all just a trap?** Answer: **yes**, no matter which way you look at it. \n\nEven disregarding my tinfoil hat ramblings, this past week's action has the smell of a classic bull-trap. \n\n**But does it actually matter?** Answer: **no**. You can still make money, and a fuck load of it, even if my tinfoil hat theory is right. *Especially* if it's right, in fact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[We're gonna last a lot longer against those hedge funds than we will against that Citadel!](https://preview.redd.it/s1xs80j3y6k71.jpg?width=2181&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80ffff00b19d3dea26c921fe6337e039c10b8a8e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 3. A New Hope**\n\nI've been sensing a turning of opinion in the short time I've been here with you all. When I first came upon this wonderful community of simpletons, DD posts about new companies were most often met with \"You had me at retard\" and \"I'm all in.\" \n\nNow it seems people are too scared to post high quality DD's because the immediate response is \"Fuck your pump &amp; dump and your mom while we're at it!\" Were there pump and dumps? Too many to count. Did I fall for one? Probably. \n\nWhile some OGs are breathing a sigh of relief at this relative return to \"normality,\" and I can't blame them, I still feel a certain something has been lost. That magic feeling, that tingling in the ballsack that whispered to you, \"*this is stupid, but it might actually work anyway*.\" This week, for one glorious moment, I felt that again and damn did it feel good. \n\nSure we bagholders are a pitiable bunch. That cannot be denied, even if we keep it close to the chest, even, I think, for those most ardent cult members. Still, there is something to be said of keeping hope alive, of holding on to the belief that broken and battered simpletons left atop seemingly insurmountable peaks on charts awash in red ***can still be saved***. \n\nSo as another week comes upon us, I implore you to not lose hope, for it is *literally all we have left*. Hear that John Williams score rise in the ether about you, and know this: It's not over until we blow up ~~the Death Star~~ *our accounts*!

        "selftext": "^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features.\n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\nPrior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.\n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.\n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\nAt that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[$F Forecast illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/4733k5nepjf71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e263777020da87805e4761e2924dcb7ac69cad20)",

Let's look at the chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Daily chart going back to the beginning of 2021](https://preview.redd.it/bvl6a9ljxjk71.png?width=2183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a364c1a212c463dbefad365ec3fe32cc1b3faf2)\n\nThese are the horizontal lines I've decided to use. As we can see from the most recent price action we broke through $11.20 USD, retraced under it, and has been hovering around there that point today. This confirms the belief that this is a line of significance because of prior price action where we had a bounce off \\~$11.20 at the end of the first bull run in January, as well as a few days of intermittent support/resistance days in between then and now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Daily chart of the last couple months](https://preview.redd.it/705s8ibkxjk71.png?width=2181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94eb09175463f3d4121c557a0a75c00a31f4152a)\n\nWhat is even more interesting to me is not only are we acting on this number as support/resistance in the last 5 trading days, on todays daily low we actually bounced off the 50 DMA. A small, bull pennant has also been formed in these few days by producing these higher highs and higher lows.\n\nRSI in the healthy range, and is respecting the Bollinger bands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 hour chart.

This could be a large descending wedge pattern, but it's not possible to predict anything with only two points of the top of the wicks. The next run up will paint a better picture.\n\nPrediction - Large price movements within the next week. GME + AMC are already moving as well.\n\nFor traders, I would recommend waiting for a volume spike of 20+ million trades in a day. $BB is already trending upwards with relatively low volume and the bottom appears to be in.\n\nVolume spike is the only confirmation needed now for a bull run.\n\nTL;DR -  \nBullish reasons:  \n\\- Bull Pennant, descending wedge, large respect to the bottom trendline, holding above $11.20 line of significance, broken out of the downward channel, large pop off the 50dma today. Large respect to the Bollinger bands. Financials coming soon, might give insight into patent sale. RSI healthy.\n\nBearish reasons:  \n\\-Needs volume spike or there will be no large movement. \\*THIS BEING SAID WE ARE STILL IN A LARGE UPTREND. I AM ONLY SAYING THIS FOR MY PREDICTION FOR A LARGE MOVEMENT SOON\\*  \n\\-Financials may not have any insight to the patent sale. If there's no good patent sale money or information, these financials will be shit unless you guys all bought 10 copies of Cyclance to your friends and family.\n\nPosition:  \n2000 shares.\n\nDYOD.

I've been following HOOD pretty closely, and it looks like HOOD's short-seller's are about to hit the giant brick wall that is their wives' boyfriends.  \n\n\nHOOD is the stock ticker for company named Robinhood. They're a small, undiscovered micro-cap stock in the fintech space as a mobile-first brokerage/trading platform. A retarded group of traders are angry at them because of a situation with another relatively unknown micro-cap called GameStop, and believe you me, this big beautiful group of retards absolutely hates money. So when HOOD IPOd a couple of weeks back, I expected these retards (they call themselves apes) to be spitefully short, no matter the cost. And you know what? They're even shorter than I could have imagined - this greasy bag of shit looks like it could blow up right in these crayon-eater's faces.  \n\n\nOne thing I've noticed over the past year is squeezes seem to happen on Wednesday of the third week of the month. If you go back and look at GME and AMC, you'll see what I mean. I've been told this is because monthlies, weeklies and futures are expire on this date? So that's when most margins are called? Well guess what this week is. It's the third week of the month and that Wednesday is two days away. Making things even more interesting, HOOD, a fresh and highly-volatile IPO is set to report their first ever earnings after-hours this Wednesday.  \n\n\nThis is in no shape or form financial advice, I literally have no clue what the fuck I'm doing. Got it? Cool. Let's roll that beautiful bean footage.  \n\n\nAccording to Ortex, shorts are currently only able to borrow around 17.5 million total shares. The shorts have been at 100% utilization for the last 6 days. Is that a lot? I don't know. I know they only IPOd with 55 million shares. I have no clue if that's how many shares are currently in the public float. If it is, that's a lot (31.8%), and on par with several other current meme stonks like AMC. That said, I don't really think float matters in this case.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xytvp6szjsh71.png?width=1958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=004300f9899d751ba6ee5613712423972fbd5cb9\n\nOrtex TLDR: All 17.5 million shares available for short-selling look to be already shorted. \n\nCross-referencing this info with Fintel, it seems to align.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtwuunb0lsh71.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1c8d42524ee30fe850264f50a0e93a5b5834922\n\n  \nAs far as I can tell, HOOD is becoming harder and harder to short making it incredibly hard to artificially deflate the price. \n\nThe other thing giant red baboon butt stat in the bunch is the Cost To Borrow Rate. Ortex has this anywhere between 46.97 and 86.47%, with an average of 66.93%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4va6ae1zmsh71.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76f05783f91c1bd25fe692d0977021ed23ee4ce6\n\n66.93%...\n\nYour mom said that's really expensive. She said, \"At a 67% borrow rate, @ a $49 share price, the stock would have to drop to $16.17 per share just for these shorts to break even\". I don't know her that math works out, but if does, you probably have better odds at breeding miniature horse ducks.\n\nThat's a lot of bleeding, I'd think that means these shorts need to make their money quick.\n\nNot necessarily believing either of these garbage platforms, I decided to try and short a HOOD share myself, just to see what E-Trade told me. Here's what I got.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2h1dlh9dmsh71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c26aecb48b5a93665a9d1e89320c5a91b5c797\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bofdnd9dmsh71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a97d6bf85ab15d9f6b7daf04387be58fc17b1d3\n\nAn estimated borrow rate of 48%. While that's not the 67% Ortex is touting, that's wayyyyy more than the standard 0.2 to 1% you'll find on other stocks like APPL, Z or SFIX.\n\nAnother point is the short-shares changing of hands seems to be slowing. I don't know these crayon eaters have managed to swap out 4 - 8 million short-shares while keeping utilization at 100%, but good golly they've been done doing it. Ortex and Fintel give you different numbers, but either way you cut the baby it looks like the swapping is slowing down today.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdmmzqtoqsh71.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5290a8eaf88a40d96bc52b06e1abc203885c463\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1c18stoqsh71.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66800ab1017dffc68775ca856d7da23aaa8702b\n\nNow what does all this mean? No fuckin idea. My best guess, I'd think volatility will increase going into earnings, and at that high of a borrow rate with that few of shares to short available, I wouldn't think the share price needs much movement to the upside to really start squeezing some balls. I guess we'll find out.  \n\n\nTLDR: Am retarded. Help. Not in any way financial advice.",

        "selftext": "# I. Introduction\n\nI think the **hardest part about trading is that the market is constantly evolving**. We are creatures of habit, as a result we get complacent and think we can find a single, comfortable strategy that works an infinite amount of times. This is almost never the case; different market conditions call for different approaches**.** By combining this post with my last, you should **obtain a basic understanding of how you can read market conditions, and adapt with the market.**\n\nIf you [read my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TickerWizards/comments/p24uma/follow_the_money_how_to_catch_every_rotation_and/), you now know when money is flowing into equities, and when it is flowing into bonds, the dollar and other safe havens. You also know about the different indexes, and what basket of stocks they carry. You even know about some interesting correlations that have arisen recently related to tech and a risk off rotation.\n\nIn this one - I'm going to take it a step further, and dig a little deeper, showing you all how to tell exactly which types equities money is flowing to, and **how to use that to generate high probability trades.** In this era of passive indexation, **you are almost never just buying one stock**. You are buying one stock - and every stock correlated to it. That means, **when you are buying CLOV and PLTR - you are also buying WISH, BB, AMC, UWMC and GME.** This obviously is not a category of stocks by traditional means - but in recent times it has become one. The point is - **you are going all in on one stock and you don't even realize it.**\n\nTo avoid this phenomenon - you need to understand the different different industries present within the market. Equities all belong to at least one of these - **and will usually track the rest of the stocks within their respective industry quite closely.**\n\n# II. The Eleven Sectors That Define The Market\n\nThere is generally believed to be eleven different sectors that equities belong to. In this section, I'll detail what each one is, **the ETF you can use to track it**, and what environment it usually outperforms in.\n\nAlso, there's two main categories for stocks: **cyclicals - which follow the business cycle, and non-cyclicals - which perform the same year round.**\n\n# 1 - Energy (VDE)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The energy sector is a category of stocks that relate to producing or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry also includes integrated power utility companies such as renewable energy and coal.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, this sector is dominated by the oil industry. You will notice renewables will hardly effect it's price movements a vast majority of the time. While many are trying to shift away from oil, it will likely be a massive part of our economy and our market long into the future.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nIn most situations - the energy sector is cyclical. This means when our economy is doing well and expanding - it will perform well.  When it isn't, the reverse is true. Because it is dominated by a commodity, energy companies also have no issue passing on inflation to their consumers. However, keep in mind this one is a bit special because of OPEC and their ability to influence price.\n\n\"OPEC is a cartel that **aims to manage the supply of oil** in an effort to set the price of oil on the world market, in order to avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\nBasically, they have most of the oil, and fix the prices to their liking. This can have some unforeseen effects on the market, so if you are trading energy you definitely want to monitor their movements.\n\n# 2 - Materials (VAW)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products,\u00a0and forestry products.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThe materials sector is cyclical. It is sensitive to changes in the economy and tracks it pretty closely. This is another sector that can easily pass inflation onto their consumers due to the nature of their products. It's also going to be especially sensitive to any changes in the supply and demand of raw materials worldwide.\n\n# 3 - Industrials (VIS)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The industrial goods sector includes stocks of companies that mainly produce capital goods used in manufacturing, resource extraction, and construction. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, the materials sector passes raw materials to the industrials sector - which converts them to products used to manufacture the final products passed on to consumers.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it is so closely tied to how much companies are producing - this sector is also cyclical. This is yet another sector that can pass the costs of inflation onto their consumers. Subsequently, due to it's close ties with the materials sector - it will be especially sensitive to the supply and demand of raw materials.\n\n# 4 - Consumer Discretionary (VCR)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nEssentially, anything broke people can't afford, like those who went all in on WISH calls before earnings, goes in this basket.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it depends on the income of consumers - this is also a cyclical sector. When the economy is thriving, people will have more money to blow on non-essential goods, like $120 Lululemon shorts, or tickets to Disney World.\n\n# 5 -  Consumer Staples (VDC)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically the opposite of consumer discretionary - these are things people **NEED** not things that they **WANT.**\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThese are non-cyclical, or defensive - which means regardless of how the economy is doing they will perform more or less the same. This means when the economy is taking a turn for the worst, they will generally outperform the other sectors. This doesn't mean they are immune to business cycle changes entirely, but they are certainly much less affected by them.\n\n# 6 - Health Care (VHT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. The healthcare sector is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for close to a fifth of overall gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. healthcare sector benefits from a strong system of medical research and development, in cooperation with the higher education system and the technology industry. The aging U.S. population and the advancing senescence of the Baby Boomer generation are driving ongoing strong demand in the healthcare sector.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis one is a bit complicated because there are a few industries within the sector, namely: medical equipment, drug R&amp;D, and health insurance. The sector is non-cyclical - but each industry has it's own quirks.\n\nThe drug industry in particular often moves independently of everything else on the market, because it is highly dependent on new developments and news pieces related to potentially groundbreaking treatments. Health insurance and medical equipment is usually non-negotiable regardless of the business cycle - so it will outperform in times of economic distress, and generally perform the same year round.\n\n# 7 - Financials (VFH)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The financial sector is a section of the economy\u00a0made up of\u00a0firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This\u00a0sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBanks involve the supply and demand of money. They make money through fees and interest rate spreads. Banks perform well during economic expansion when companies and individuals are borrowing money. One of the main drivers of borrowing/lending is interest rates. In a rising rate environment (observed through TNX, TLT, US treasury yield curve), banks will outperform. They pay short term rates (front of curve) on their deposits, and lend money to companies or individuals at a higher interest rate (further out on the curve) capturing a difference or \"spread\" on interest paid vs received. Understanding treasury yields and how they are related to the daily price movements in the financial sector is a great place to start.\n\n# 8 - Information Technology (VGT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nThis one really needs no introduction.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is a bit tricky due to some correlations that have arisen from 2020 onward. For most of history - most tech stocks were cyclical. However, due to COVID, extremely low interest rates, and some other factors - these assets are now being rotated into during a risk off environment - and are seen as a safe-haven. Who knows if this will stand, but it's important to understanding when money will flow there **today.** More on this can be found in my previous post, where I go into detail on this phenomenon.\n\n# 9 - Communication Services (VOX)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio, or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and Internet service providers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is another non-cyclical sector. Whether the economy is good or bad - people aren't going to give up communicating with each other. In today's world, everyone needs a phone - even if it's a flip phone - and everyone needs internet access. One of the interesting parts of this sectors is that it is comprised of both growth names and income names. While the larger names are more consistent with dividends, the smaller names often have more room for capital appreciation and earnings growth.\n\n# 10 - Utilities (VPU)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. It is a large sector, and an important part of the U.S. economy, with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion (as of March 2021). Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service landscape\u2014providing as they do such staples for daily living\u2014and are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to generate a steady income for their portfolios.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nYet another non-cyclical basket of stocks. Regardless of the business cycle, demand for utilities almost always remains constant. These are some of the most stable stocks on the market - so WSB is probably better going to forget they exist moments after reading this post.\n\n# 11 - Real Estate (VNQ)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made\u2014including water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nLike most industries, real estate involves the supply and demand of property, both residential and commercial. Real Estate is closely related to changes in construction or development, but also heavily influenced by interest rates. Most participants are using Loan to Value (LTV), anywhere from 60-85% of the total property value; therefore, interest rate changes will impact participants' ability to borrow. Thinking through these variables, its safe to assume that real estate performs well in low interest rate environments, low-moderate commodity prices for construction, population growth, and government (both local and federal) infrastructure support. When rates rise, the debt burden increases and money is hard to borrow; which ultimately affect the ability to invest in new projects or purchase homes. \n\n# III. Practical Applications\n\nTo use all of this information - and convert it to probabilities I can use to trade - **I perform technical analysis on each sector ETF using the 1 year 1 day chart (swing trade timeframe)**. If one is breaking out of a large setup - I can assume money is going to move there in the future. If others are forming nice setups - I know to add them to my watchlist.\n\nAfter identifying a sector that is likely to become strong in the near future - **I then filter it further by finding particular stocks within the sector that have similar setups**. I usually look through the top holdings of the ETF pertaining to the sector. I do this because individual stocks are more volatile than sector ETFs and more liquid - which means there is more money to be made. If a particular stock is lagging behind the sector, it can also mean there is even more to gain than in the case of another name.\n\nYou can take this one step further and combine information from my previous posts by identifying whether we are risk on, or risk off. Cyclicals are generally going to outperform while we are risk on. Non-cyclicals will generally outperform while we are risk off.\n\n**Example -**\n\nLast week - I noticed financials were breaking out of a large falling wedge on the daily chart. This has a bullish bias - and indicates price will make a strong move in the near future. I didn't have to scan the ETF for this one, since all the stocks in it are household names.\n\n[VFH \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/f8lboux5r5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d82ab4b17cc79ada84ec6e65473fd1eac870309)\n\nI also noticed BAC had formed a bull flag. This was all the information I needed to enter some October Calls which I closed today for a nice profit.\n\n[BAC \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/fjfynyv7r5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e0cb7ec1e5d05729cf3e41382c8591662a896e)\n\nLastly, ZB was trending downwards and yields were rising. This was an environment banks outperform in - which means it enforced my probability of success even more.\n\n[ZB \\(Bonds\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/6wwok3sbr5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596609c73c6bbfdfc01392c6262a9bb8044cb204)\n\nYou don't have to use technical analysis. This is just my preference. Many people use complex fundamental and economic analysis to determine these rotations. The important thing is understanding the environments particular sectors will outperform in.\n\n# IV. Closing Thoughts\n\nLet me first apologize for the wall of text. I'll do my best to summarize it for those with short attention spans in my TL;DR.\n\nIf you got through all of this, and my last post - hopefully you have a better understanding of tracking where money is going, and using that to make higher quality trades. I think this is a topic most of WSB doesn't know exists (or doesn't believe in) which causes them to lose lots of money because they are all in on meme stocks, and meme stocks haven't been in the rotation for a little while. That's not to say they won't ever be again - but for the time being the broader market has made all time highs almost daily whilst these names continue to puke their guts out.\n\n# V. TL;DR\n\nThere's **11 sectors** within the stock market.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Energy **(VDE, Cyclical)**\n2. Materials **(VAW, Cyclical)**\n3. Industrials **(VIS, Cyclical)**\n4. Consumer Discretionary **(VCR, Cyclical)**\n5. Consumer Staples **(VDC, Non-Cyclical)**\n6. Healthcare **(VHT, Non-Cyclical)**\n7. Financials **(VFH, Cyclical)**\n8. Information Technology **(VGT, Cyclical Most Of The Time)**\n9. Communication Services **(VOX, Non-Cyclical)**\n10. Utilities **(VPU, Non-Cyclical)**\n11. Real Estate **(VNQ, Cyclical)**\n\nEach one will be rotated into depending on different market conditions. Understanding this is important to being able to make money at any given time. I perform technical analysis to determine when each is being rotated into, but you can use any analysis you want.",

        "selftext": "I get it. RobinHood is a scummy company that fucked over a lot of the people in WSB. Their handling of GME earlier this year was awful, and the CEO's look like if a cocker spaniel crossbred with a blob fish. \n\nEven with all of that though, I'm bullish on $HOOD for one major reason. Expansion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in 2019 RobinHood ran an private invite-only program in the UK. Only running for a few months, it was used as a test-bed to find out more about European trading. \n\n[TechCrunch 2019 - RobinHood gets UK license](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/robinhood-fca/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKG7momxcnbzlJ6EJPxz7t0Ux6sSkRffw06WEHg6HLH6mEVcRAwmuKh-l6iar_yuxYhHI3OEVvm72ziwkLocRvJCHvJxKoYFgrUFqquFSLy71LwgCaDQrMpPb2QX6cdT6UB3-MD-HLPZwNq5HSXNUtWqRvjNs3jsS5593QBP0yVE)\n\nIn 2020, amidst all of the Covid chaos, RH announced that they were postponing the UK launch 'Indefinitely'. \n\n[robinhood.com/uk/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-uk/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, using this knowledge, combined with my extreme autism and a dash of confirmation bias. I believe this is the next move for RH. \n\nWhy else would they have recently launched their IPO. Could it be because RobinHood is a shady company that robs people of their money and is under legal pressures after the events of the last year; that is possible. But I don't care, because my only interest is the share price of the stock, and the number of zero's at the end of my bank balance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition- $1420 @ 1:5 leverage. \n\nDisclaimer- I don't even use RH, I'm just a autistic Europoor chasing tendies",

So is TSLA, and TSLA has proved for seemingly years now - never short TSLA.\n\nSQ seems like a similar company but seems to me to be in an even better financial position than TSLA.\n\nSo when looking for tech sector, future sector (we can dub it?), I compare SQ to AAPL and MSFT, both have done amazingly well recently while staying in traditional norms of P/E and PEG ratios and are more quantifiable.\n\nSo what about SQ? Is someone who looks at these, can they walk us through why to own SQ and not just buy MSFT? Is there real downside risk? Can the carpet be pulled out like GME and AMC which are obvious garbage?\n\nOr is SQ a solid company and it basically keeps the territory it takes?",

I don't want to see anyone who gets screwed over by Robinhood yet again complaining about it.

The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:\n\n*Processing img 5sldutzq33j71...*\n\nThe thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n*Processing img h7b6sm9t43j71...*\n\n*Processing img iz041qtv43j71...*\n\n  \n\\[The OC post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n*Processing img ncwwuqz253j71...*\n\n  \nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n*Processing img 58sg96eg53j71...*\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\n*Processing img nltp4a1l53j71...*\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\n*Processing img 44m2qp2q53j71...*\n\n  \nWhat you see above is the screenshot from \\[my other post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme\\_to\\_amc\\_and\\_bb\\_last\\_week\\_ladies\\_go\\_first\\_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it\u2019s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:\n\n*Processing img klztgzo563j71...*\n\nAs you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a \u2018memestonk\u2019? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **\u03c3 (sigma)** and **\u03b2 (beta**).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a \\[Bloomberg article\\](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n&gt;A \u201cblack swan\u201d event \u2014 made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life \u2014 comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren\u2019t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A \u201cfive-sigma event\u201d is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\n  \nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.  \n\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\n*Processing img 47plfcth63j71...*\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&amp;P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets\u2019 health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  \n\n\n&gt;2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n&gt;The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n*Processing img enhgxe0773j71...*\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\n*Processing img 2pb2k9qv63j71...*\n\nThis represents what Buffet called \u201cA Time Bomb\u201d in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n*Processing img xct7amb273j71...*\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n*Processing video 1rflh5jy33j71...*\n\n  \n\\*\\*In Tyler\u2019s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n*Processing img f9xgxitt73j71...*\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn\u2019t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what\u2019s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang\u2019s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I\u2019m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: \u2018Stonks only go up\u2019. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\n*Processing img zfh3tjyk83j71...*\n\n&gt;Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can\u2019t live without the always following stimulus \u201cdose\u201d. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we\u2019ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:  \n\n\n&gt;**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it\u2019s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\n*Processing img nw7vw0dk93j71...*\n\n*Processing img ebo8be5r93j71...*\n\n*Processing img kqwqmy9t93j71...*\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man\u2019s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it\u2019s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there\u2019s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that\u2019s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it\u2019s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that\u2019s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the \u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 movie? Oh,  \n\n\n&gt;It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n  \n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I\u2019m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn\u2019t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\n*Processing video m0gwzvob43j71...*\n\n**And here is why I\u2019m so confident in my bet and its timing:**  \n\n\n*Processing img w51ks5l2b3j71...*\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the\\_big\\_short\\_20\\_why\\_bears\\_may\\_soon\\_reconsider/), and \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this\\_time\\_its\\_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n*Processing img mcg9etbeh3j71...*\n\n*Processing img xbskfzdkh3j71...*\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**",

If the post is inappropriate to write on this subreddit, please let me know.\n\nI'm a junior student living in Seoul, South Korea. And in my experience, I think it's nearly impossible to make a living out of ordinary income in this city. Everything is expensive here. While I'm expected to receive about $2300(thinking of becoming a police officer) per month as a starting salary,  the average monthly rent for a studio apartment in Seoul exceeds $800\\~$1000. Considering the living expenses and miscellaneous expenditures, it's nearly impossible to make a save money. Now I'm quite panicking about my future.\n\nAnyway, so I started investing since I was a high school student. I've done a lot of mistakes(including investment in GME) but in the end, I realized that it is important to make a sustainable investment. But considering my lack of investment budget, I'm confused about whether I should be more aggressive and either leverage my bank account or invest in high-volatility stocks. Or even invest in futures or options.\n\nMy ultimate dream is to have a $2M\\~$4M amount of assets before the age of 40\\~45, but it seems like a high hope to me.

        "selftext": "Hey Everyone, it's u/nobjos back with this week's analysis!  \n\n**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -&gt; What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&amp;text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rrgu9o8705g71.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781036d4ac5a896c8ed5bf391b623255f1f5898a)\n\nS&amp;P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/32eyi1hb05g71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet\u2019s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&amp;P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&amp;P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n&gt;A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don\u2019t completely agree with this view that it\u2019s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&amp;P 500\u2018s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/hoiy89zc05g71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/gre25fff05g71.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66cda7571f6f8a3ffe63e9f6ea12d2700523fc83)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&amp;P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry\u2019s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&amp;P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100\u2019s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don\u2019t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI\u2019s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI\u2019s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let\u2019s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you\u2019ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it\u2019s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.\n\n\\[8\\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor!",

        "selftext": " Sup Retards  \n\nI am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the state police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with an rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brothers insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.  \n\nIn that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to \u201claunder\u201d my brother\u2019s $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling \u201cbuy and hold\u201d while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That\u2019s when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.  \n\nWith our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pd), praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.  \n\nIn all sincerity, from what I\u2019ve read thus far, I\u2019ve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven\u2019t read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an \u201curban disaster,\u201d and a \u201ccomplete shithole.\u201d Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can\u2019t read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.  \n\nI know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that\u2019s not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there\u2019s some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and \u201cIndian Land\u201d management. It so happens that a section of North America\u2019s largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.  \n\nI\u2019m not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE\u2014in fact the last thing I want is pt Wallstreetbets ganging up on CLNE again. You people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.  \n\nFor those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *\u201cClean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*\u201d They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comprable to diesl, and the also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what other retard\u2019s High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn\u2019t do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE \u2013 that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal support is good for CLNE.  \n\n**Infrastructure Bill** **&amp; CLNE DD**\n\nOverall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and12 pt hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, support for labor. It\u2019s unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.  \n\nHere are some highlights from the [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cms-energy-corp-cms-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript-2021-07-29) which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Increasing supply while in talks with \u201cdozens of dairies\u201d sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.)     \n \n* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.  \n \n* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today\u2019s growing demand.  \n \n* Increasing customers in New York,  Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and Amazon.    \n \n* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.  \n \n* Electric \tand hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by \tinfrastructure and mineral resources. Using the s California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \\[an \texample\\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon \treduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.  \n \n* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.  \n \n\nContent pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 16 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, \tmethane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.  \n \n* Some related grants have requirements such as must be \u201cregionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable\u201d which fits CLNE current business perfectly.    \n \n* \u201cAppalachian regional energy hub initiative\u201d  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to \tindividuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and \tactivities, at will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)  \n \n* $52,488,065,375 \tthrough 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.    \n \n* Massive \tamounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The \tentire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially \u201cSubtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,\u201d as \tRNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it \tspecifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it\u2019s easy to see CLNE taking advantage.     \n \n\nWhether it\u2019s intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair\u2019s language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bills language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.  \n\n**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**\n\nI bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including \u201cmy brother,\u201d lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.\n\nInstead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we\u2019re the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about how a virus is going to kill everyone if we don\u2019t take a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son\u2019s laptop?\n\nAs culturally enriching as the president\u2019s son\u2019s DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn\u2019t want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.  \n\nThe earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, \u201cexcluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nThis is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he\u2019s retarded, but because he\u2019s a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don\u2019t think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair\u2019s cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it\u2019s consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without CVOVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it\u2019s going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it\u2019s bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.  \n\nAt 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don\u2019t really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn\u2019t really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.  \n\nI\u2019m now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them in to CLNE shares every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it\u2019s easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if i were to place a relatively placid bet.",

I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features.\n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\nPrior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.\n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.\n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\nAt that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[My Ford Forecast illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/4cwxwa68rrg71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d66883a4eddd06a88a5799b3a19095280b050f4)",

I support GME both AMC and GME. Full disclosure I am not the first to point out these similarities but I have looked into them myself using the charts I pulled off of the SEC Website. AL Trades is where I first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and I just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided. \n\nLooking at the Charts you see peaks in FTDs in Both GME and AMC before the price run up. **FOR GME HAPPENED 3 TIMES and THE FTD PATTERN HAS AN ERIE CORRELATION THE SHARE PRICE IMO.** \n\nThe Peak FTDs for GME were just over 3m and GMEs Float is 56m according to Google\n\n3m FTDs / 56m Shares = just over 5% of the float \n\nThe Peak FTDs for AMC were just over 27M and the float according to google is 511m\n\n27m FTDs / 511m Shares = Just over 5% of the Float \n\nThe Peak FTDs for CLOV were just over 19m and the Float according to Google is 133M\n\n19m FTD\u2019s / 133m Shares = **Just over 14%**!\n\nAnother thing I want to point out is that AMC before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from CLOV in June. \n\nAMC went from around $2 to $20 then back down to $6 \n\nCLOV went from $6 to $28 and is now in the $8 range which it has been for a couple of weeks now. Is the Bottom in for CLOV? I don\u2019t really know but I hope so. \n\n**Full disclosure I am a CLOV shareholder and very bullish on CLOV from all of My research I have done and that others have done.** \n\n**I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice.

        "selftext": "All year for about 13 months now I've  been heavy on growth. I've come close to my position nearly doubling in value, and then lost all my profits in February. Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.\n\nI have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.\n\n\nI recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. \n\nI'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. \n\nI sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)\n\nI made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.\n\n\nJust wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.\n\n\nI am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.\n\n\nMy advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.\n\n\nLove to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..\n\nBTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well.

        "selftext": "**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -&gt; What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&amp;text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zy80c4kttbg71.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22edbacdeeeab17670d3eaba794fffc867f1c41f)\n\nS&amp;P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/5z8phclwtbg71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet\u2019s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&amp;P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&amp;P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n&gt;A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don\u2019t completely agree with this view that it\u2019s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&amp;P 500\u2018s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/vpb5klt1ubg71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/evh5eqm3ubg71.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae3ca2caa10241fdec61f39801c45b7c14fce6cf)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&amp;P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry\u2019s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&amp;P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100\u2019s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don\u2019t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI\u2019s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI\u2019s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let\u2019s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you\u2019ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it\u2019s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.\n\n\\[8\\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor!",

        "selftext": "\u201cAugust 12, 2021 10:57 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long Ideas\n\nClover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) is under r/WallStreetBets\u2019 spotlight again after printing second-quarter earnings. The Medicare advantage provider reported a whopping $412 million in revenue, more than double the consensus estimate of $205.4 million.\n\nClover was soaring 20% toward the $10 mark early Thursday morning. Although Clover respectably printed a blowout quarter, and the share price could go much higher due to that, the stock also has bizarre characteristics that have helped to make it a short squeeze candidate in the past.\n\nBetween June 7 to July 9 Clover Health soared about 205% from $9.35 to an all-time high of $28.85. Like GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) back in January, Clover\u2019s underlying statistics appeal to retail traders looking to squeeze short sellers:\n\nSmall Float: Clover has a relatively small float of just 112.38 million shares.\nOwnership Levels: Clover has an unbelievable 119.64% of its float tied up in the hands of insiders and institutions with 95.06% of its shares held by institutions and 24.58% by insiders.\nShort Interest: 25.26 million shares, meaning 22.47% of its total float, is held short although this number has dropped from 35.89 million in June.\nSee Also: How to Buy Clover Health Stock\n\nThe Clover Health Chart: After Clover\u2019s parabolic run in June the stock sold off over 72% and found a bottom at the $7.84 mark. For the past 20 trading days, Clover has held above the level and traded in a tight sideways pattern under $8.99.\n\nThere has been low volume in Clover\u2019s stock during the sideways trading, indicating a lack of both sellers and buyers. Often when a security\u2019s volume drops off for an extended period of time, either huge bearish or bullish volume comes in to break it from the sideways pattern.\n\nClover closed Wednesday just below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, which is bearish. If Clover trades above the $8.70 area on Thursday it will be above both commonly followed EMAs and the short-term sentiment will be bullish.\n\nThe 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a tool used to measure overall sentiment in a stock, is at about the $10.50 area. If Clover trades below the SMA, overall sentiment is bearish; if the stock is able to clear the level, the sentiment will shift to bullish.\u201d \n\n\nIn other words. CLOV to fucking space.

        "selftext": "\nA few months ago, I became excited about the realm that was stocks and investing. I saw explosion of meme stocks that was AMC and GME and couldn\u2019t get wait to get on. I put a small amount of money into crypto and onto stocks. Then I left my investing accounts alone for a bit. \n\nEvery month I would use DCA and buy some crypto and put a little more in stocks. My portfolio was selling coming together but it was literal pennies to what happened later. This month I would make a series of options that bought my portfolio from 300 to 3000. I was ecstatic, that was bigger than any paycheck I gotten so far. $3000 is chump changed and I planned on getting that to 30k by the end of the year. \n\nI didn\u2019t see how I was slowly falling into gambling. There was no excuse. I\u2019m didn\u2019t understand the greeks, IV. Yes I know how stupid I am and how that sounds. I would flip a coin and bet with my greedy ass head, not understanding the fundamentals well enough nor do tying to learn it. Last week I made one bad call and got burnt hard.  I got desperate, I began revenge trading and chasing my losses rather than just moving on. 0DTE calls. Increasingly riskier positions. I would be too easily effected by my emotions and would spend hours glued on my phone, watching as my account bled red. As gamblers fallacy, I bet the last remaining of my buying power on a Hail Mary. (AMC) Yes, roast me and burn me on a stake that\u2019s what I did. \n\nBut it worked! I had gained 56% of my losses back, yet I wasn\u2019t content. I wanted to wipe away all my losses and I held. Held to the point where my account got wiped out and I lost 75% of my portfolio. It\u2019s here that realized that I was doing. I was on verge of liquidating all my stocks and withdrawing more money to gain my losses. I knew then I had to stop. \n\nI\u2019m not broke, I don\u2019t know anyone money nor do I have major financial obligations. I have my parents who support me through everything I do. I\u2019m getting a new job next week. Why am I writing this? I guess as a reflection as my short descent into a near gambler. I\u2019m not smarter than the market nor should one every skip the fundamentals of the market. ESPECIALLY for something like options. I had no exit strategy nor risk management. I am happy that I was able to grow my account 10x in less than a month. However 3k in the grand scheme is nothing. I\u2019m taking this time to understand and work on my weakness. I want to hug my parents and tell them I\u2019ll do better. I\u2019m going to deactivate my trading account and focus on learning and building up my capital before I tamper with the market again. A painful lesson but one I felt like I needed. \n\nTLDR; Dumb kid with beginner luck thinks he\u2019s better than the market and nearly loses it all.",

        "selftext": " A few housekeeping items first. \n\nBack in the $GME heyday, a user by the name of [/u/indonesian\\_activist](https://www.reddit.com/u/indonesian_activist/) made a series of Gamma squeeze calculators, with version numbers, changelogs and the whole shebang. I'm not that excel savvy, so this is simply version 2 that he made that I am using now for $CLOV (he got to v.8 with $GME). So shoutout to him for allowing me to use his work and post this here for $CLOV.\n\nThose of you who already know what gamma squeezes are can skip the first two bullet points if you want.  \n\n\n* As a lot of you know, there is HUGE amounts of Open Interest in CLOV Call options next week. What not as many of you know, I presume, is that the market makers themselves are the ones buying and selling a lot of the call and put options. Contrary to popular belief, they aren't picking sides (at least not in this instance) and simply want to remain Delta neutral, that is, balanced in their risk.\n* As such, this can lead to what is called a Gamma squeeze. Market makers are forced to buy shares to cover their asses and remain delta neutral as the share price goes up. This, of course, increases buying pressure which can then lead to even higher prices, triggering more call options to be in the money, and it becomes a self-sustaining process until it hits the top of the option chain (if there are sufficient amounts of Open Interest).\n* This week (8/13) is a typical week, where we have about 32,000 call options and 8,300 put options. Next week 8/20 is a big monthly options expiration date, however, coming shortly after earnings are released, which means a LOT of options are bought. How many? How about 278,000 call options and 70,500 put options! These are \\*INCREDIBLE\\* numbers for a stock with a float of 112,000,000 shares. It's almost 10x the amount of options as a typical week! Triggering many of these strike prices would cause a gamma squeeze due to millions and millions of shares needing to be bought!\n* This leads me to the spreadsheet calculator. I don't have a great way of sharing it with you in an editable format, other than if you download the spreadsheet to Excel and run it there. If you are afraid of macros and malware, I don't blame you, don't download it if you don't want to. You can just look through the screenshots and viewable spreadsheet link here. I will link to the spreadsheet below, where you can view the data, and download the spreadsheet to play around with if you want to.\n* This data is good for tomorrow 8/10 only. The spreadsheet needs to be updated daily, as the numbers obviously change quickly, especially with options that expire soon. When the spreadsheet shows how many shares the MM's (market makers) need to buy, it means how many they need to buy for that day and immediately, IF the stock is at the projected price I input. For example, here are how many shares they need to buy if we hit $9 tomorrow, $10, $11, $12, and $15. If people are interested, I can attempt to post these daily with the updated numbers. The main thing to look at in these screenshots is the Net Buy needed by Evil MM's. In this first screenshot, it shows 1,139,848 shares needing be purchased and the percentage of the entire float (approx 112,000,000 shares) that represents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$9 target price on 8\\/10](https://preview.redd.it/9pbukvcjifg71.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f9c4a6cb3be06777de7c2002ca67c4157f7bfc9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$10 target price on 8\\/10](https://preview.redd.it/rt4rmwsuifg71.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dd66ba6f87f51819ce7854d6dce595b139fd153)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img due91rvrifg71...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$12 target price on 8\\/11](https://preview.redd.it/c7g2ltetifg71.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=330f4a475352d6054a1aecb6bb8057291ba2c318)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$15 target price on 8\\/11](https://preview.redd.it/ey1ovqqxifg71.png?width=1189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb532ef752f483806c8bdb836b07ae69e3ac5c89)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* As you can see, the number of shares that would need to be purchased by MM's can be a runaway train with the right amount of pressure applied. We've seen how low the daily volume has gotten as of late, but also how quickly that volume goes up once the share price starts picking up a bit. (9MM volume last week vs 26M today) This is part of the reason why.\n* I have done my best to double-check all the numbers and equations on this spreadsheet, but again, I am not great with this stuff, and am only using tools others have built in the past. If you notice any errors affecting the data, please let me know. I have no problem admitting fault, and will edit this post or remove it outright if the data is wrong or misleading.\n* Last but not least here is the link to the spreadsheet. Again, you will need to download to Excel to use the scripts to make it work. Enjoy.[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xrFShr20I-C5aYGR8L7Znyqnq\\_uYYahAX2jSUBKaPA8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xrFShr20I-C5aYGR8L7Znyqnq_uYYahAX2jSUBKaPA8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTL;DR: Modest share price increase this week makes CLOV go brrrrrrt.\n\nLast but not least, buy and hold, I am not a financial analyst, do your own research, and let's fucking go my fellow CLOVers!",

        "selftext": "I've been sitting patiently waiting for the money to flow back into the memes, and it looks like we are just getting started.   \n\n\nFirst let us first examine our faithful slut SPY. Reaching returns of over 100% since March lows, it is time for this baby to start a correction. Looking like \"sell in September\" is going to be a real thing for all the boomers real soon. Looking at the chart below, it is only a matter of time before SPY decides to dump its pants. I'm not saying a recession type of drop, but at least a small correction. My target would be the blue zone marked below, but I would expect at least a retest of 400 at some point.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otk9bws3bej71.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e308ef6d7b168dcf9c1d3bb4c94c8d4ec80c5d7d\n\nNow on to our memes. BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little. It's almost like people are treating the meme stocks as safety for their cash because they have been pretty consistent with basically having a negative Beta. \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsnvy5bocej71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29185f1559ae2ef9819853b4f9bcb5a5890ccde\n\nIf you look at the chart below, this is the weekly chart showing the first and second meme pumps casually lifting off the long term trendline marked. The selling has dried up, and volume managed to enter at the right time to maintain our trend. Now if this holds and BB manages to break above our ATH($28.77), $40 per share could be possible given that the current market situation develops as I imagine it will, with SPY falling at the same time the memes are catching significant inflow.   \n\n\nCurrent position in BB: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rcqrj6scej71.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=459d81e090de32f6a06af99303d7ca11fcf12764\n\nCurrent position in SPY (lottos):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35c84pkvcej71.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f703a336d834c7143a689d881bf7d0db063d1d9a\n\nBB, AMC, GME, lets fuck the hedgies once again. \n\nYou can also follow more of my bullshit at TheStonksDaddy on twitter.",

        "selftext": "So i have an Merrill Edge Roth IRA account that i have been using for options. Monday i tried to sell a covered call 167.50 GME, August 27th.. Market order it did not execute immediately and i cancelled it.. tried again 3 minutes later with 170 GME, same problem cancelled order..\n\nYet the next day Tuesday i get a message saying i have a naked uncovered short position. Well ROTH IRA dont allow margin and dont allow naked selling. So i argue back and forth with them on the phone, they accept responsibilty for the 2nd trade, but the first they say is my fault and since they closed it out i'm on the hook for a $5000 loss..\n\nSo i want to know where i can see minute by minute trades on the 167.50 GME Aug 27th Call from Monday 8/23. I know when my order was placed 9:42am(bid was 2.67), and at the price they executed it(3.75) i want to see what time it was executed.. they closed it out at 53.12 on Tuesday when GME spiked, so yeah a pretty big damn loss. \n\nDoes anyone know of a site with this data? I've been on the CBOE site but its really confusing if i buy the data with 1 minute intervals will that show trade executions. I just want to make my case that the order did not execute when i placed it and since i cancelled it i should not be on the hook for it..",

        "selftext": "I apologize in advance for my terrible English, it is not my native language. I want to raise the FTD topic. The other day I had nothing to do and I started looking at all the stocks that had a short-squeeze this year. In addition to the GME and AMC (AMC - FTD 5.5%, and 3 months later a jump in the price of 3500%, GME - FTD 4,5%, after 2 months leap in price in 3000-4000%)\n\nWKHS: FTD 2%, and 2 months later a jump on 100%\n\nBBBY: FTD 1.7%, and after 3 months leap 300%\n\nPRTS: FTD-1.4%, after 3 months, a jump of 100%\n\nIn short, I sat like this, checked the companies, went through all the meme tickers of reddit, among other things. And at some point I caught myself that seeing the number of shares in FTD and the subsequent price jump after a while, I can roughly determine how many shares in the company are in circulation. And suddenly I guessed the approximate number of shares, well, give or take 20 million.\n\nAnd then I come to the palantir $ PLTR. I see that they had a jump in FTD of 20 million shares in February. But the price chart shows calm and silence. A huge number of shares in FTD and no impact on the price. I must admit, at that moment I was afraid. Did the theory fail? After all, in order for such a huge number of shares in FTD not to affect the price, the total number of shares in circulation should be huge. I looked at how many shares palantir has in turnover-1.8 billion, so FTD is about 1 percent, everything is fine.\n\nIn general, what I'm talking about: all companies whose FTD was at least about 2% had a jump after 2-4 months. In the case of GME and AMC and their FTD in the region of 5%, the growth was already in 3000-4000%. Oh, yes. Do you know what FTD CLOV had on July 8, to be precise? 12,8%. I will leave the conclusions to you, I will only say that I have not seen such a percentage in any company.\n\nSee for yourself how surprisingly the FTD chart and the price chart correlate\n\n[GME](https://preview.redd.it/08tu4vjtq5h71.jpg?width=1281&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84998519ce121e095c31eaa2813f44ae24f7576)\n\n[AMC](https://preview.redd.it/jb6nxuisq5h71.jpg?width=1487&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f1ac5b2faa741deed09701dc772af937656fc0)\n\n[WKHS](https://preview.redd.it/7ve3trerq5h71.jpg?width=1327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c25520667265563822bd45be01556a8ebc3009f2)\n\n[PRTS](https://preview.redd.it/1n4ql6dqq5h71.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418b5ee816d9cd01be854313cc584ff59652c72a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/g6l4024pq5h71.jpg?width=1320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ff362bffb0c0170e2a152ec8561a8d91df8746a)",

        "selftext": "## Introduction\n\nMartoma is born to Indian immigrant parents in Florida. Goes to Duke then gets into Harvard Law School. Gets kicked out of Harvard Law School for changing his grades, him \\*and his family\\* change their names and with his new name he finesses his way into Stanford Business School a year later.\n\nMartoma starts working for Steven A. Cohen at the infamous SAC Capital, and this is where he makes magic happen for a very short while, before getting caught. As an aside, it's weird to me that no news outlets have reported on his release since the prosecution of SAC Capital was so big at the time. \n\n## Mild connection to GameStop frenzy\n\nThe connection is not a big stretch IMO, basically the way my line of thinking works here is Mathew Martoma kept Steven A. Cohen (infamous for insider trading) out of jail by not throwing him under the bus. Cohen then mentors Gabe Plotkin and Gabe starts Melvin Capital. So, if Cohen was in jail then Melvin Capital would never have opened up shop, let alone be massively short GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's about it, some more details below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A bit more detail:\n\nMathew Martoma was behind one of the most profitable insider trading scandals in history with a profit of $276 million. \\[[link](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/02/07/former-sac-trader-found-guilty-insider-trading/6EIbg0eTH5Gawy2rnOBaFO/story.html)\\]\n\nMathew Martoma was quietly released from prison on July 19th on good behavior, according to his wiki page \\[[wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Martoma)\\]. I wasn't able to confirm it with any other news sources, but I did do an inmate search on him three weeks ago on [bop.gov](http://bop.gov/) (I've been following this dude's story for a while) and he came up then  \u2014  he doesn't come up anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## More detail about the GME connection\n\nGME had a high short interest which was a significant part of DFV's thesis \\[[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4)\\].\n\nOne of the biggest shorts (and losers) in this saga by dollar amount was  Melvin Capital (who have lost just over $5 billion YTD) and was later given $2.75BN just to keep running by Citadel and Steven A. Cohen \\[[link](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qm7508qzvkhd/Melvin-Capital-Added-to-GameStop-Shorts-as-WallStreetBets-Took-Aim)\\].\n\nMelvin Capital is run by Gabe Plotkin who was Steven A. Cohen's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.  No Cohen \u2192 No Plotkin \u2192 No Melvin \u2192 No massive GME short. Anecdotally, Plotkin actually overrode his analysts and himself made the decision to sell GME calls. \\[[link](https://twitter.com/goodalexander/status/1403342212180676609)\\]\n\n## Martoma's involvement with SAC Capital\n\nMathew Martoma made the insider trades using information about an Alzheimer's drug from two doctors \\[[link](https://annarborobserver.com/articles/the_corruption_of_sid_gilman_full_article.html)\\] including, a then professor at the University of Michigan, Sid Gilman.\n\nProsecutors find and grill Martoma to get Cohen, but Martoma doesn't give him up \\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/martoma-grain-sand-probe-sacs-010630030.html)\\]. Since they couldn't get Cohen, and there were no willing witnesses they went after the company itself and a few of the employees instead. If Martoma had given up Cohen then Cohen would be in prison and Melvin Capital would've never opened up shop.\n\n## Highlights from Martoma's life story\n\nMathew Martoma also has a little bit of an insane personal story (just lifting this off of wikipedia \\[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Martoma)\\] and Bloomberg \\[[link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-10/ex-sac-s-martoma-harvard-expulsion-revealed-on-trial-eve)\\]):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Born in Florida in 1974 to Indian immigrants as Ajai Mathew Mariamdani Thomas (note the different name)\n2. Graduates from a public high school in Florida and goes to Duke for (this is a good one) Biomedics, *Ethics*, and Public Policy\n3. Goes to Harvard Law School\n4. Is applying to a clerkship for a federal appeals (ironic) court judge and changes a couple Bs to As cuz fuck it why not\n5. Gets caught, tells the registrar at school it was all \"just a joke\" (direct quote)\n6. Gets kicked out of Harvard Law School, but appeals\n7. Appeal fails, Martoma gets kicked out of Harvard\n8. Spends a year volunteering\n9. Changes his name to Mathew Martoma, and from 1994 to 2001 his parents and both of his siblings also change their last name to Martoma. With his new name, he applies to and is accepted to Stanford Business School (what a fucking finesse holy shit).\n10. Does the insider trading deed, gets a \\~$9 million bonus in January 2009, fired for losing money in 2009 and 2010 and moves back to Florida\n11. Gets prosecuted and goes to jail sometime in the fall of 2014, also loses his Stanford MBA for having been admitted under false pretenses\n12. Released on good behavior on July 19, 2021",

        "selftext": "^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features.\n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\nPrior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.\n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.\n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\nAt that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[$F Forecast illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/4733k5nepjf71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e263777020da87805e4761e2924dcb7ac69cad20)",

        "selftext": "Alright apes, taking a stab and fairly robust crayon-eating DD here. I've been following HOOD pretty closely, and it looks like HOOD's short-seller's are about to hit the giant brick wall that is their wives' boyfriends.  \n\n\nHOOD is the stock ticker for company named Robinhood. They're a small, undiscovered micro-cap stock in the fintech space as a mobile-first brokerage/trading platform. A retarded group of traders are angry at them because of a situation with another relatively unknown micro-cap called GameStop, and believe you me, this big beautiful group of retards absolutely hates money. So when HOOD IPOd a couple of weeks back, I expected these retards (they call themselves apes) to be spitefully short, no matter the cost. And you know what? They're even shorter than I could have imagined - this greasy bag of shit looks like it could blow up right in these crayon-eater's faces.  \n\n\nOne thing I've noticed over the past year is squeezes seem to happen on Wednesday of the third week of the month. If you go back and look at GME and AMC, you'll see what I mean. I've been told this is because monthlies, weeklies and futures are expire on this date? So that's when most margins are called? Well guess what this week is. It's the third week of the month and that Wednesday is two days away. Making things even more interesting, HOOD, a fresh and highly-volatile IPO is set to report their first ever earnings after-hours this Wednesday.  \n\n\nThis is in no shape or form financial advice, I literally have no clue what the fuck I'm doing. Got it? Cool. Let's roll that beautiful bean footage.  \n\n\nAccording to Ortex, shorts are currently only able to borrow around 17.5 million total shares. The shorts have been at 100% utilization for the last 6 days. Is that a lot? I don't know. I know they only IPOd with 55 million shares. I have no clue if that's how many shares are currently in the public float. If it is, that's a lot (31.8%), and on par with several other current meme stonks like AMC. That said, I don't really think float matters in this case.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xytvp6szjsh71.png?width=1958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=004300f9899d751ba6ee5613712423972fbd5cb9\n\nOrtex TLDR: All 17.5 million shares available for short-selling look to be already shorted. \n\nCross-referencing this info with Fintel, it seems to align.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtwuunb0lsh71.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1c8d42524ee30fe850264f50a0e93a5b5834922\n\n  \nAs far as I can tell, HOOD is becoming harder and harder to short making it incredibly hard to artificially deflate the price. \n\nThe other thing giant red baboon butt stat in the bunch is the Cost To Borrow Rate. Ortex has this anywhere between 46.97 and 86.47%, with an average of 66.93%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4va6ae1zmsh71.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76f05783f91c1bd25fe692d0977021ed23ee4ce6\n\n66.93%...\n\nYour mom said that's really expensive. She said, \"At a 67% borrow rate, @ a $49 share price, the stock would have to drop to $16.17 per share just for these shorts to break even\". I don't know her that math works out, but if does, you probably have better odds at breeding miniature horse ducks.\n\nThat's a lot of bleeding, I'd think that means these shorts need to make their money quick.\n\nNot necessarily believing either of these garbage platforms, I decided to try and short a HOOD share myself, just to see what E-Trade told me. Here's what I got.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2h1dlh9dmsh71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c26aecb48b5a93665a9d1e89320c5a91b5c797\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bofdnd9dmsh71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a97d6bf85ab15d9f6b7daf04387be58fc17b1d3\n\nAn estimated borrow rate of 48%. While that's not the 67% Ortex is touting, that's wayyyyy more than the standard 0.2 to 1% you'll find on other stocks like APPL, Z or SFIX.\n\nAnother point is the short-shares changing of hands seems to be slowing. I don't know these crayon eaters have managed to swap out 4 - 8 million short-shares while keeping utilization at 100%, but good golly they've been done doing it. Ortex and Fintel give you different numbers, but either way you cut the baby it looks like the swapping is slowing down today.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdmmzqtoqsh71.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5290a8eaf88a40d96bc52b06e1abc203885c463\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1c18stoqsh71.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66800ab1017dffc68775ca856d7da23aaa8702b\n\nNow what does all this mean? No fuckin idea. My best guess, I'd think volatility will increase going into earnings, and at that high of a borrow rate with that few of shares to short available, I wouldn't think the share price needs much movement to the upside to really start squeezing some balls. I guess we'll find out.  \n\n\nTLDR: Am retarded. Help. Not in any way financial advice.",

        "selftext": "# I. Introduction\n\nI think the **hardest part about trading is that the market is constantly evolving**. We are creatures of habit, as a result we get complacent and think we can find a single, comfortable strategy that works an infinite amount of times. This is almost never the case; different market conditions call for different approaches**.** By combining this post with my last, you should **obtain a basic understanding of how you can read market conditions, and adapt with the market.**\n\nIf you [read my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TickerWizards/comments/p24uma/follow_the_money_how_to_catch_every_rotation_and/), you now know when money is flowing into equities, and when it is flowing into bonds, the dollar and other safe havens. You also know about the different indexes, and what basket of stocks they carry. You even know about some interesting correlations that have arisen recently related to tech and a risk off rotation.\n\nIn this one - I'm going to take it a step further, and dig a little deeper, showing you all how to tell exactly which types equities money is flowing to, and **how to use that to generate high probability trades.** In this era of passive indexation, **you are almost never just buying one stock**. You are buying one stock - and every stock correlated to it. That means, **when you are buying CLOV and PLTR - you are also buying WISH, BB, AMC, UWMC and GME.** This obviously is not a category of stocks by traditional means - but in recent times it has become one. The point is - **you are going all in on one stock and you don't even realize it.**\n\nTo avoid this phenomenon - you need to understand the different different industries present within the market. Equities all belong to at least one of these - **and will usually track the rest of the stocks within their respective industry quite closely.**\n\n# II. The Eleven Sectors That Define The Market\n\nThere is generally believed to be eleven different sectors that equities belong to. In this section, I'll detail what each one is, **the ETF you can use to track it**, and what environment it usually outperforms in.\n\nAlso, there's two main categories for stocks: **cyclicals - which follow the business cycle, and non-cyclicals - which perform the same year round.**\n\n# 1 - Energy (VDE)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The energy sector is a category of stocks that relate to producing or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry also includes integrated power utility companies such as renewable energy and coal.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, this sector is dominated by the oil industry. You will notice renewables will hardly effect it's price movements a vast majority of the time. While many are trying to shift away from oil, it will likely be a massive part of our economy and our market long into the future.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nIn most situations - the energy sector is cyclical. This means when our economy is doing well and expanding - it will perform well.  When it isn't, the reverse is true. Because it is dominated by a commodity, energy companies also have no issue passing on inflation to their consumers. However, keep in mind this one is a bit special because of OPEC and their ability to influence price.\n\n\"OPEC is a cartel that **aims to manage the supply of oil** in an effort to set the price of oil on the world market, in order to avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\nBasically, they have most of the oil, and fix the prices to their liking. This can have some unforeseen effects on the market, so if you are trading energy you definitely want to monitor their movements.\n\n# 2 - Materials (VAW)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products,\u00a0and forestry products.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThe materials sector is cyclical. It is sensitive to changes in the economy and tracks it pretty closely. This is another sector that can easily pass inflation onto their consumers due to the nature of their products. It's also going to be especially sensitive to any changes in the supply and demand of raw materials worldwide.\n\n# 3 - Industrials (VIS)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The industrial goods sector includes stocks of companies that mainly produce capital goods used in manufacturing, resource extraction, and construction. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, the materials sector passes raw materials to the industrials sector - which converts them to products used to manufacture the final products passed on to consumers.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it is so closely tied to how much companies are producing - this sector is also cyclical. This is yet another sector that can pass the costs of inflation onto their consumers. Subsequently, due to it's close ties with the materials sector - it will be especially sensitive to the supply and demand of raw materials.\n\n# 4 - Consumer Discretionary (VCR)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nEssentially, anything broke people can't afford, like those who went all in on WISH calls before earnings, goes in this basket.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it depends on the income of consumers - this is also a cyclical sector. When the economy is thriving, people will have more money to blow on non-essential goods, like $120 Lululemon shorts, or tickets to Disney World.\n\n# 5 -  Consumer Staples (VDC)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically the opposite of consumer discretionary - these are things people **NEED** not things that they **WANT.**\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThese are non-cyclical, or defensive - which means regardless of how the economy is doing they will perform more or less the same. This means when the economy is taking a turn for the worst, they will generally outperform the other sectors. This doesn't mean they are immune to business cycle changes entirely, but they are certainly much less affected by them.\n\n# 6 - Health Care (VHT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. The healthcare sector is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for close to a fifth of overall gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. healthcare sector benefits from a strong system of medical research and development, in cooperation with the higher education system and the technology industry. The aging U.S. population and the advancing senescence of the Baby Boomer generation are driving ongoing strong demand in the healthcare sector.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis one is a bit complicated because there are a few industries within the sector, namely: medical equipment, drug R&amp;D, and health insurance. The sector is non-cyclical - but each industry has it's own quirks.\n\nThe drug industry in particular often moves independently of everything else on the market, because it is highly dependent on new developments and news pieces related to potentially groundbreaking treatments. Health insurance and medical equipment is usually non-negotiable regardless of the business cycle - so it will outperform in times of economic distress, and generally perform the same year round.\n\n# 7 - Financials (VFH)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The financial sector is a section of the economy\u00a0made up of\u00a0firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This\u00a0sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBanks involve the supply and demand of money. They make money through fees and interest rate spreads. Banks perform well during economic expansion when companies and individuals are borrowing money. One of the main drivers of borrowing/lending is interest rates. In a rising rate environment (observed through TNX, TLT, US treasury yield curve), banks will outperform. They pay short term rates (front of curve) on their deposits, and lend money to companies or individuals at a higher interest rate (further out on the curve) capturing a difference or \"spread\" on interest paid vs received. Understanding treasury yields and how they are related to the daily price movements in the financial sector is a great place to start.\n\n# 8 - Information Technology (VGT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nThis one really needs no introduction.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is a bit tricky due to some correlations that have arisen from 2020 onward. For most of history - most tech stocks were cyclical. However, due to COVID, extremely low interest rates, and some other factors - these assets are now being rotated into during a risk off environment - and are seen as a safe-haven. Who knows if this will stand, but it's important to understanding when money will flow there **today.** More on this can be found in my previous post, where I go into detail on this phenomenon.\n\n# 9 - Communication Services (VOX)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio, or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and Internet service providers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is another non-cyclical sector. Whether the economy is good or bad - people aren't going to give up communicating with each other. In today's world, everyone needs a phone - even if it's a flip phone - and everyone needs internet access. One of the interesting parts of this sectors is that it is comprised of both growth names and income names. While the larger names are more consistent with dividends, the smaller names often have more room for capital appreciation and earnings growth.\n\n# 10 - Utilities (VPU)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. It is a large sector, and an important part of the U.S. economy, with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion (as of March 2021). Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service landscape\u2014providing as they do such staples for daily living\u2014and are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to generate a steady income for their portfolios.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nYet another non-cyclical basket of stocks. Regardless of the business cycle, demand for utilities almost always remains constant. These are some of the most stable stocks on the market - so WSB is probably better going to forget they exist moments after reading this post.\n\n# 11 - Real Estate (VNQ)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made\u2014including water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nLike most industries, real estate involves the supply and demand of property, both residential and commercial. Real Estate is closely related to changes in construction or development, but also heavily influenced by interest rates. Most participants are using Loan to Value (LTV), anywhere from 60-85% of the total property value; therefore, interest rate changes will impact participants' ability to borrow. Thinking through these variables, its safe to assume that real estate performs well in low interest rate environments, low-moderate commodity prices for construction, population growth, and government (both local and federal) infrastructure support. When rates rise, the debt burden increases and money is hard to borrow; which ultimately affect the ability to invest in new projects or purchase homes. \n\n# III. Practical Applications\n\nTo use all of this information - and convert it to probabilities I can use to trade - **I perform technical analysis on each sector ETF using the 1 year 1 day chart (swing trade timeframe)**. If one is breaking out of a large setup - I can assume money is going to move there in the future. If others are forming nice setups - I know to add them to my watchlist.\n\nAfter identifying a sector that is likely to become strong in the near future - **I then filter it further by finding particular stocks within the sector that have similar setups**. I usually look through the top holdings of the ETF pertaining to the sector. I do this because individual stocks are more volatile than sector ETFs and more liquid - which means there is more money to be made. If a particular stock is lagging behind the sector, it can also mean there is even more to gain than in the case of another name.\n\nYou can take this one step further and combine information from my previous posts by identifying whether we are risk on, or risk off. Cyclicals are generally going to outperform while we are risk on. Non-cyclicals will generally outperform while we are risk off.\n\n**Example -**\n\nLast week - I noticed financials were breaking out of a large falling wedge on the daily chart. This has a bullish bias - and indicates price will make a strong move in the near future. I didn't have to scan the ETF for this one, since all the stocks in it are household names.\n\n[VFH \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/f8lboux5r5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d82ab4b17cc79ada84ec6e65473fd1eac870309)\n\nI also noticed BAC had formed a bull flag. This was all the information I needed to enter some October Calls which I closed today for a nice profit.\n\n[BAC \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/fjfynyv7r5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e0cb7ec1e5d05729cf3e41382c8591662a896e)\n\nLastly, ZB was trending downwards and yields were rising. This was an environment banks outperform in - which means it enforced my probability of success even more.\n\n[ZB \\(Bonds\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/6wwok3sbr5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596609c73c6bbfdfc01392c6262a9bb8044cb204)\n\nYou don't have to use technical analysis. This is just my preference. Many people use complex fundamental and economic analysis to determine these rotations. The important thing is understanding the environments particular sectors will outperform in.\n\n# IV. Closing Thoughts\n\nLet me first apologize for the wall of text. I'll do my best to summarize it for those with short attention spans in my TL;DR.\n\nIf you got through all of this, and my last post - hopefully you have a better understanding of tracking where money is going, and using that to make higher quality trades. I think this is a topic most of WSB doesn't know exists (or doesn't believe in) which causes them to lose lots of money because they are all in on meme stocks, and meme stocks haven't been in the rotation for a little while. That's not to say they won't ever be again - but for the time being the broader market has made all time highs almost daily whilst these names continue to puke their guts out.\n\n# V. TL;DR\n\nThere's **11 sectors** within the stock market.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Energy **(VDE, Cyclical)**\n2. Materials **(VAW, Cyclical)**\n3. Industrials **(VIS, Cyclical)**\n4. Consumer Discretionary **(VCR, Cyclical)**\n5. Consumer Staples **(VDC, Non-Cyclical)**\n6. Healthcare **(VHT, Non-Cyclical)**\n7. Financials **(VFH, Cyclical)**\n8.

Their handling of GME earlier this year was awful, and the CEO's look like if a cocker spaniel crossbred with a blob fish. \n\nEven with all of that though, I'm bullish on $HOOD for one major reason. Expansion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in 2019 RobinHood ran an private invite-only program in the UK. Only running for a few months, it was used as a test-bed to find out more about European trading. \n\n[TechCrunch 2019 - RobinHood gets UK license](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/robinhood-fca/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKG7momxcnbzlJ6EJPxz7t0Ux6sSkRffw06WEHg6HLH6mEVcRAwmuKh-l6iar_yuxYhHI3OEVvm72ziwkLocRvJCHvJxKoYFgrUFqquFSLy71LwgCaDQrMpPb2QX6cdT6UB3-MD-HLPZwNq5HSXNUtWqRvjNs3jsS5593QBP0yVE)\n\nIn 2020, amidst all of the Covid chaos, RH announced that they were postponing the UK launch 'Indefinitely'. \n\n[robinhood.com/uk/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-uk/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, using this knowledge, combined with my extreme autism and a dash of confirmation bias. I believe this is the next move for RH. \n\nWhy else would they have recently launched their IPO. Could it be because RobinHood is a shady company that robs people of their money and is under legal pressures after the events of the last year; that is possible. But I don't care, because my only interest is the share price of the stock, and the number of zero's at the end of my bank balance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition- $1420 @ 1:5 leverage. \n\nDisclaimer- I don't even use RH, I'm just a autistic Europoor chasing tendies",

A lot of the successful people are retards, but they\u2019re not *retards*.

(STOP FUCKING DM\u2019ING ME) \n\n3. Do you somehow believe that I, a dumbass who spends 99% of his time on neoliberal and the ape subreddit, am anywhere near the fucking same as the OP of the first post?\n\n4. Do you believe my post is a grand conspiracy by Robinhood to make people use it, as though me being able to deposit 15k accidentally helps them in any shape or form?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then congratulations, you\u2019re retarded (or a \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08, I\u2019d argue they\u2019re synonyms at this point). \n\nI think I learned some lessons, though. I shall never make the mistake of assuming the average person isn\u2019t a complete fucking dumbass, and I give ZJZ credit for not committing genocide at this point.

I just hope everyone who was peddling the \"get in before it's too late\", \"uplisting is going to moon\" rhetoric takes a moment to remember that we're still in an INCREDIBLY speculative investment here. \n\nThere isn't a huge gap between psychedelics and \"short squeeze\" meme stocks right now. They're both plays on catalysts the probabilities of which are impossible to quantify, but if they land in favour of the stock, can give massive returns. Sure, I believe psychedelic stocks have an ethical dimension to them and that we're hopefully contributing to something that will benefit humanity. AMC and GME are just about making money. But if I'm being honest deep down, if I didn't think I stood to make a lot of money off of investing in psychedelics, I probably wouldn't be doing it. \n\nEven though momentum is looking like it's on our side, we simply do not know what will happen in 1, 2 or 5 years.

I feel 43 is a lot but at the same time when going through them and trying to trim it down, I can't bring myself to get rid of almost anymore. I feel like all of them are good plays to watch, even if I've never purchased 90% of them, I still like the sectors and potential of all of them, and like to see how they do month over month. I had more than 43 recently but did decide to unfollow a few. \n\nMy friend who also invests has like 10-11 (mainly amc and gme, because that's pretty much all he holds). We talk about stocks almost everyday and I feel he is missing out on a lot by following so little. He likes to concentrate on just those certain ones. There are so many opportunities out there and I just don't know how someone can follow so few. But maybe 43 is a little compared to some of you? Maybe it's too much? \nWhat do you like to do and what is your \"strategy\" for adding and deleting from your watchlist?

After several weeks of thoughtful consideration and research, I have finally made a decision to...\n\n\\[Double down\\](https://imgur.com/a/zlXWOOh) on my bet, like any decent retard residing in this cozy place would do.\n\nBut first things first, let's revise the original bet, \\[the underlying post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/).\n\n(I\u2019m not a financial advisor, just a retard who enjoys writing big texts and making risky bets)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter I. The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:\n\n*Processing img 5sldutzq33j71...*\n\nThe thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n*Processing img h7b6sm9t43j71...*\n\n*Processing img iz041qtv43j71...*\n\n  \n\\[The OC post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n*Processing img ncwwuqz253j71...*\n\n  \nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n*Processing img 58sg96eg53j71...*\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\n*Processing img nltp4a1l53j71...*\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\n*Processing img 44m2qp2q53j71...*\n\n  \nWhat you see above is the screenshot from \\[my other post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme\\_to\\_amc\\_and\\_bb\\_last\\_week\\_ladies\\_go\\_first\\_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it\u2019s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:\n\n*Processing img klztgzo563j71...*\n\nAs you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a \u2018memestonk\u2019? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **\u03c3 (sigma)** and **\u03b2 (beta**).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a \\[Bloomberg article\\](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n&gt;A \u201cblack swan\u201d event \u2014 made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life \u2014 comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren\u2019t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A \u201cfive-sigma event\u201d is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\n  \nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.  \n\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\n*Processing img 47plfcth63j71...*\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&amp;P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets\u2019 health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  \n\n\n&gt;2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n&gt;The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n*Processing img enhgxe0773j71...*\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\n*Processing img 2pb2k9qv63j71...*\n\nThis represents what Buffet called \u201cA Time Bomb\u201d in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n*Processing img xct7amb273j71...*\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n*Processing video 1rflh5jy33j71...*\n\n  \n\\*\\*In Tyler\u2019s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n*Processing img f9xgxitt73j71...*\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn\u2019t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what\u2019s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang\u2019s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I\u2019m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: \u2018Stonks only go up\u2019. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\n*Processing img zfh3tjyk83j71...*\n\n&gt;Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can\u2019t live without the always following stimulus \u201cdose\u201d. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we\u2019ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:  \n\n\n&gt;**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it\u2019s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\n*Processing img nw7vw0dk93j71...*\n\n*Processing img ebo8be5r93j71...*\n\n*Processing img kqwqmy9t93j71...*\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man\u2019s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it\u2019s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there\u2019s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that\u2019s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it\u2019s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that\u2019s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the \u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 movie? Oh,  \n\n\n&gt;It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n  \n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I\u2019m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn\u2019t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\n*Processing video m0gwzvob43j71...*\n\n**And here is why I\u2019m so confident in my bet and its timing:**  \n\n\n*Processing img w51ks5l2b3j71...*\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the\\_big\\_short\\_20\\_why\\_bears\\_may\\_soon\\_reconsider/), and \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this\\_time\\_its\\_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n*Processing img mcg9etbeh3j71...*\n\n*Processing img xbskfzdkh3j71...*\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**",

It's in business since 1994\n\n\\- It's growing revenue every year. 2018: $937M, 2019: $1,097M, 2020: $1,700M and TTM: $2,015M\n\n\\- It's profitable, with a profit margin of 8%\n\n\\- It's growing income every year: 2018: $22M, 2019: $24M, 2020: $158M and TTM: $211M\n\n\\- They have positive cash flow and are sitting on $136M of cash. TTM free cash flow is $138M.\n\n\\- With 91M shares outstanding, this means that they could, theoretically, start paying a dividend of $1 per share without running in debt (which many other companies do). That's a 4% dividend yield for a growing company.\n\nIn short, many money, good money \ud83d\udcb5 \ud83d\udcb5 \ud83d\udcb5\n\n**Share price:**\n\nat time of writing, price is hovering around 25,6, that's more than 40% lower from ATHs.Their P/E ratio is 16. Current S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio is 34.\n\nLook at this beautiful graph and be amazed by my paint skills: there was a strong $30 support until WSB came in with a short pump, after that the price has been regularly falling.\n\n[CRSR Stock Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bgknz7eshi71.jpg?width=1489&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14dac94257d5650bae110fea236e05c225097151)\n\nMy take on this is:\n\n\\- Some boring cuck institutional investors are pulling back and waiting to add more shares. They don't like owning volatile stocks subjects to pumps etc. I will be inserting myself in this sweet stock while they watch from the corner of the room, like the good cucks that they are.\n\n\\- Employees and Eagle Tree Capital are selling their shares. They got in pre-ipo, so they are still making a good profit at the price of $25. Some of them are paper-handing it and taking profit. Pathetic.\n\nI know we hate GME comparisons but let's just fantasize for a second:look how after the squeeze, the price kept falling for a while, until it found some volume and skyrocketed back up, to never fall to those levels again.\n\n[GME Stock Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/q8d15vmhshi71.jpg?width=1507&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce317857fab1e769558fb80562eb72f3c12b556d)\n\nIn short, apes go to moon \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Other catalysts:**\n\n\\- Gaming industry is booming and in case of another lockdown you know what happens\n\n\\- Chip shortage means that the sales that we are seeing now are not at full potential- Institutions buying in. At the moment Eagle Tree Capital is still the majority shareholder, after cutting it's position from 92% to 58%. Most other institutions have just a small position (see picture below).\n\n\\- Acquisitions. Turtle beach company ($HEAR) was priced around $25 when one of their shareholders proposed acquiring the full stake at $36,5 per share. That's a 46% premium. The company board refused, clearly understanding that the market is underpricing these companies.\n\n[Institutional Ownerhip](https://preview.redd.it/3oq48z2kshi71.jpg?width=1036&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c53cb07d1eeb855102f243a5d89b0a63a8640f3)\n\nPositions:\n\n200 Shares at 30;\n\n2x 21 jan 2022 calls, strike 30;\n\n11x cash covered puts at various strikes (25; 27,5; 40)\n\nIt took me 1 hour to type all of this and paint the not-so-straight lines, so please at least tell me to go get fked by my wife's bf.  \n\n\n**EDIT!**  \nI haven't mentioned anywhere about the 20% short interest in CRSR and how Citadel is the main  \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b shorting it  \n \n\n[Citadel Shorting 33M of CRSR](https://preview.redd.it/i7m08lhm4ji71.png?width=1381&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52624362b6b707884c3ee391b3aa8571cf392c09)\n\nJust for reference, GME short interest was 30% in February 2021.",

        "selftext": "Hey Everyone, it's u/nobjos back with this week's analysis!  \n\n**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -&gt; What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&amp;text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rrgu9o8705g71.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781036d4ac5a896c8ed5bf391b623255f1f5898a)\n\nS&amp;P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/32eyi1hb05g71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet\u2019s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&amp;P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&amp;P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n&gt;A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don\u2019t completely agree with this view that it\u2019s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&amp;P 500\u2018s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/hoiy89zc05g71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/gre25fff05g71.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66cda7571f6f8a3ffe63e9f6ea12d2700523fc83)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&amp;P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry\u2019s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&amp;P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100\u2019s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don\u2019t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI\u2019s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI\u2019s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let\u2019s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you\u2019ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it\u2019s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.\n\n\\[8\\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor!",

Also the consolidation of Deep OTM call OI (Are all MMs or HFs just gambling?) Or do these combination of positions serve a specific purpose the the underlying stock?

        "selftext": " Sup Retards  \n\nI am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the state police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with an rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brothers insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.  \n\nIn that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to \u201claunder\u201d my brother\u2019s $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling \u201cbuy and hold\u201d while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That\u2019s when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.  \n\nWith our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pd), praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.  \n\nIn all sincerity, from what I\u2019ve read thus far, I\u2019ve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven\u2019t read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an \u201curban disaster,\u201d and a \u201ccomplete shithole.\u201d Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can\u2019t read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.  \n\nI know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that\u2019s not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there\u2019s some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and \u201cIndian Land\u201d management. It so happens that a section of North America\u2019s largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.  \n\nI\u2019m not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE\u2014in fact the last thing I want is pt Wallstreetbets ganging up on CLNE again. You people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.  \n\nFor those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *\u201cClean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*\u201d They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comprable to diesl, and the also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what other retard\u2019s High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn\u2019t do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE \u2013 that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal support is good for CLNE.  \n\n**Infrastructure Bill** **&amp; CLNE DD**\n\nOverall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and12 pt hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, support for labor. It\u2019s unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.  \n\nHere are some highlights from the [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cms-energy-corp-cms-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript-2021-07-29) which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Increasing supply while in talks with \u201cdozens of dairies\u201d sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.)     \n \n* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.  \n \n* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today\u2019s growing demand.  \n \n* Increasing customers in New York,  Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and Amazon.    \n \n* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.  \n \n* Electric \tand hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by \tinfrastructure and mineral resources. Using the s California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \\[an \texample\\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon \treduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.  \n \n* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.  \n \n\nContent pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 16 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, \tmethane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.  \n \n* Some related grants have requirements such as must be \u201cregionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable\u201d which fits CLNE current business perfectly.    \n \n* \u201cAppalachian regional energy hub initiative\u201d  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to \tindividuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and \tactivities, at will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)  \n \n* $52,488,065,375 \tthrough 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.    \n \n* Massive \tamounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The \tentire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially \u201cSubtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,\u201d as \tRNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it \tspecifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it\u2019s easy to see CLNE taking advantage.     \n \n\nWhether it\u2019s intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair\u2019s language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bills language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.  \n\n**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**\n\nI bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including \u201cmy brother,\u201d lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.\n\nInstead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we\u2019re the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about how a virus is going to kill everyone if we don\u2019t take a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son\u2019s laptop?\n\nAs culturally enriching as the president\u2019s son\u2019s DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn\u2019t want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.  \n\nThe earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, \u201cexcluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nThis is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he\u2019s retarded, but because he\u2019s a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don\u2019t think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair\u2019s cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it\u2019s consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without CVOVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it\u2019s going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it\u2019s bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.  \n\nAt 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don\u2019t really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn\u2019t really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.  \n\nI\u2019m now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them in to CLNE shares every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it\u2019s easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if i were to place a relatively placid bet.",

        "selftext": "^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features.\n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\nPrior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.\n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.\n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\nAt that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[My Ford Forecast illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/4cwxwa68rrg71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d66883a4eddd06a88a5799b3a19095280b050f4)",

Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.\n\nI have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.\n\n\nI recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. \n\nI'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. \n\nI sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)\n\nI made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.\n\n\nJust wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.\n\n\nI am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.\n\n\nMy advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.\n\n\nLove to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..\n\nBTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well.

        "selftext": "**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -&gt; What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&amp;text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zy80c4kttbg71.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22edbacdeeeab17670d3eaba794fffc867f1c41f)\n\nS&amp;P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/5z8phclwtbg71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet\u2019s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&amp;P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&amp;P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n&gt;A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don\u2019t completely agree with this view that it\u2019s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&amp;P 500\u2018s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/vpb5klt1ubg71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/evh5eqm3ubg71.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae3ca2caa10241fdec61f39801c45b7c14fce6cf)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&amp;P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry\u2019s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&amp;P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100\u2019s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don\u2019t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI\u2019s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI\u2019s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let\u2019s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you\u2019ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it\u2019s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.\n\n\\[8\\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor!",

        "selftext": "\u201cAugust 12, 2021 10:57 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long Ideas\n\nClover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) is under r/WallStreetBets\u2019 spotlight again after printing second-quarter earnings. The Medicare advantage provider reported a whopping $412 million in revenue, more than double the consensus estimate of $205.4 million.\n\nClover was soaring 20% toward the $10 mark early Thursday morning. Although Clover respectably printed a blowout quarter, and the share price could go much higher due to that, the stock also has bizarre characteristics that have helped to make it a short squeeze candidate in the past.\n\nBetween June 7 to July 9 Clover Health soared about 205% from $9.35 to an all-time high of $28.85. Like GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) back in January, Clover\u2019s underlying statistics appeal to retail traders looking to squeeze short sellers:\n\nSmall Float: Clover has a relatively small float of just 112.38 million shares.\nOwnership Levels: Clover has an unbelievable 119.64% of its float tied up in the hands of insiders and institutions with 95.06% of its shares held by institutions and 24.58% by insiders.\nShort Interest: 25.26 million shares, meaning 22.47% of its total float, is held short although this number has dropped from 35.89 million in June.\nSee Also: How to Buy Clover Health Stock\n\nThe Clover Health Chart: After Clover\u2019s parabolic run in June the stock sold off over 72% and found a bottom at the $7.84 mark. For the past 20 trading days, Clover has held above the level and traded in a tight sideways pattern under $8.99.\n\nThere has been low volume in Clover\u2019s stock during the sideways trading, indicating a lack of both sellers and buyers. Often when a security\u2019s volume drops off for an extended period of time, either huge bearish or bullish volume comes in to break it from the sideways pattern.\n\nClover closed Wednesday just below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, which is bearish. If Clover trades above the $8.70 area on Thursday it will be above both commonly followed EMAs and the short-term sentiment will be bullish.\n\nThe 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a tool used to measure overall sentiment in a stock, is at about the $10.50 area. If Clover trades below the SMA, overall sentiment is bearish; if the stock is able to clear the level, the sentiment will shift to bullish.\u201d \n\n\nIn other words. CLOV to fucking space.

        "selftext": "\nA few months ago, I became excited about the realm that was stocks and investing. I saw explosion of meme stocks that was AMC and GME and couldn\u2019t get wait to get on. I put a small amount of money into crypto and onto stocks. Then I left my investing accounts alone for a bit. \n\nEvery month I would use DCA and buy some crypto and put a little more in stocks. My portfolio was selling coming together but it was literal pennies to what happened later. This month I would make a series of options that bought my portfolio from 300 to 3000. I was ecstatic, that was bigger than any paycheck I gotten so far. $3000 is chump changed and I planned on getting that to 30k by the end of the year. \n\nI didn\u2019t see how I was slowly falling into gambling. There was no excuse. I\u2019m didn\u2019t understand the greeks, IV. Yes I know how stupid I am and how that sounds. I would flip a coin and bet with my greedy ass head, not understanding the fundamentals well enough nor do tying to learn it. Last week I made one bad call and got burnt hard.  I got desperate, I began revenge trading and chasing my losses rather than just moving on. 0DTE calls. Increasingly riskier positions. I would be too easily effected by my emotions and would spend hours glued on my phone, watching as my account bled red. As gamblers fallacy, I bet the last remaining of my buying power on a Hail Mary. (AMC) Yes, roast me and burn me on a stake that\u2019s what I did. \n\nBut it worked! I had gained 56% of my losses back, yet I wasn\u2019t content. I wanted to wipe away all my losses and I held. Held to the point where my account got wiped out and I lost 75% of my portfolio. It\u2019s here that realized that I was doing. I was on verge of liquidating all my stocks and withdrawing more money to gain my losses. I knew then I had to stop. \n\nI\u2019m not broke, I don\u2019t know anyone money nor do I have major financial obligations. I have my parents who support me through everything I do. I\u2019m getting a new job next week. Why am I writing this? I guess as a reflection as my short descent into a near gambler. I\u2019m not smarter than the market nor should one every skip the fundamentals of the market. ESPECIALLY for something like options. I had no exit strategy nor risk management. I am happy that I was able to grow my account 10x in less than a month. However 3k in the grand scheme is nothing. I\u2019m taking this time to understand and work on my weakness. I want to hug my parents and tell them I\u2019ll do better. I\u2019m going to deactivate my trading account and focus on learning and building up my capital before I tamper with the market again. A painful lesson but one I felt like I needed. \n\nTLDR; Dumb kid with beginner luck thinks he\u2019s better than the market and nearly loses it all.",

        "selftext": " A few housekeeping items first. \n\nBack in the $GME heyday, a user by the name of [/u/indonesian\\_activist](https://www.reddit.com/u/indonesian_activist/) made a series of Gamma squeeze calculators, with version numbers, changelogs and the whole shebang. I'm not that excel savvy, so this is simply version 2 that he made that I am using now for $CLOV (he got to v.8 with $GME). So shoutout to him for allowing me to use his work and post this here for $CLOV.\n\nThose of you who already know what gamma squeezes are can skip the first two bullet points if you want.  \n\n\n* As a lot of you know, there is HUGE amounts of Open Interest in CLOV Call options next week. What not as many of you know, I presume, is that the market makers themselves are the ones buying and selling a lot of the call and put options. Contrary to popular belief, they aren't picking sides (at least not in this instance) and simply want to remain Delta neutral, that is, balanced in their risk.\n* As such, this can lead to what is called a Gamma squeeze. Market makers are forced to buy shares to cover their asses and remain delta neutral as the share price goes up. This, of course, increases buying pressure which can then lead to even higher prices, triggering more call options to be in the money, and it becomes a self-sustaining process until it hits the top of the option chain (if there are sufficient amounts of Open Interest).\n* This week (8/13) is a typical week, where we have about 32,000 call options and 8,300 put options. Next week 8/20 is a big monthly options expiration date, however, coming shortly after earnings are released, which means a LOT of options are bought. How many? How about 278,000 call options and 70,500 put options! These are \\*INCREDIBLE\\* numbers for a stock with a float of 112,000,000 shares. It's almost 10x the amount of options as a typical week! Triggering many of these strike prices would cause a gamma squeeze due to millions and millions of shares needing to be bought!\n* This leads me to the spreadsheet calculator. I don't have a great way of sharing it with you in an editable format, other than if you download the spreadsheet to Excel and run it there. If you are afraid of macros and malware, I don't blame you, don't download it if you don't want to. You can just look through the screenshots and viewable spreadsheet link here. I will link to the spreadsheet below, where you can view the data, and download the spreadsheet to play around with if you want to.\n* This data is good for tomorrow 8/10 only. The spreadsheet needs to be updated daily, as the numbers obviously change quickly, especially with options that expire soon. When the spreadsheet shows how many shares the MM's (market makers) need to buy, it means how many they need to buy for that day and immediately, IF the stock is at the projected price I input. For example, here are how many shares they need to buy if we hit $9 tomorrow, $10, $11, $12, and $15. If people are interested, I can attempt to post these daily with the updated numbers. The main thing to look at in these screenshots is the Net Buy needed by Evil MM's. In this first screenshot, it shows 1,139,848 shares needing be purchased and the percentage of the entire float (approx 112,000,000 shares) that represents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$9 target price on 8\\/10](https://preview.redd.it/9pbukvcjifg71.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f9c4a6cb3be06777de7c2002ca67c4157f7bfc9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$10 target price on 8\\/10](https://preview.redd.it/rt4rmwsuifg71.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dd66ba6f87f51819ce7854d6dce595b139fd153)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img due91rvrifg71...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$12 target price on 8\\/11](https://preview.redd.it/c7g2ltetifg71.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=330f4a475352d6054a1aecb6bb8057291ba2c318)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$15 target price on 8\\/11](https://preview.redd.it/ey1ovqqxifg71.png?width=1189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb532ef752f483806c8bdb836b07ae69e3ac5c89)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* As you can see, the number of shares that would need to be purchased by MM's can be a runaway train with the right amount of pressure applied. We've seen how low the daily volume has gotten as of late, but also how quickly that volume goes up once the share price starts picking up a bit. (9MM volume last week vs 26M today) This is part of the reason why.\n* I have done my best to double-check all the numbers and equations on this spreadsheet, but again, I am not great with this stuff, and am only using tools others have built in the past. If you notice any errors affecting the data, please let me know. I have no problem admitting fault, and will edit this post or remove it outright if the data is wrong or misleading.\n* Last but not least here is the link to the spreadsheet. Again, you will need to download to Excel to use the scripts to make it work.

        "selftext": "I've been sitting patiently waiting for the money to flow back into the memes, and it looks like we are just getting started.   \n\n\nFirst let us first examine our faithful slut SPY. Reaching returns of over 100% since March lows, it is time for this baby to start a correction. Looking like \"sell in September\" is going to be a real thing for all the boomers real soon. Looking at the chart below, it is only a matter of time before SPY decides to dump its pants. I'm not saying a recession type of drop, but at least a small correction. My target would be the blue zone marked below, but I would expect at least a retest of 400 at some point.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otk9bws3bej71.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e308ef6d7b168dcf9c1d3bb4c94c8d4ec80c5d7d\n\nNow on to our memes. BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little. It's almost like people are treating the meme stocks as safety for their cash because they have been pretty consistent with basically having a negative Beta. \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsnvy5bocej71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29185f1559ae2ef9819853b4f9bcb5a5890ccde\n\nIf you look at the chart below, this is the weekly chart showing the first and second meme pumps casually lifting off the long term trendline marked. The selling has dried up, and volume managed to enter at the right time to maintain our trend. Now if this holds and BB manages to break above our ATH($28.77), $40 per share could be possible given that the current market situation develops as I imagine it will, with SPY falling at the same time the memes are catching significant inflow.   \n\n\nCurrent position in BB: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rcqrj6scej71.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=459d81e090de32f6a06af99303d7ca11fcf12764\n\nCurrent position in SPY (lottos):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35c84pkvcej71.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f703a336d834c7143a689d881bf7d0db063d1d9a\n\nBB, AMC, GME, lets fuck the hedgies once again. \n\nYou can also follow more of my bullshit at TheStonksDaddy on twitter.",

Market order it did not execute immediately and i cancelled it.. tried again 3 minutes later with 170 GME, same problem cancelled order..\n\nYet the next day Tuesday i get a message saying i have a naked uncovered short position. Well ROTH IRA dont allow margin and dont allow naked selling. So i argue back and forth with them on the phone, they accept responsibilty for the 2nd trade, but the first they say is my fault and since they closed it out i'm on the hook for a $5000 loss..\n\nSo i want to know where i can see minute by minute trades on the 167.50 GME Aug 27th Call from Monday 8/23. I know when my order was placed 9:42am(bid was 2.67), and at the price they executed it(3.75) i want to see what time it was executed.. they closed it out at 53.12 on Tuesday when GME spiked, so yeah a pretty big damn loss. \n\nDoes anyone know of a site with this data? I've been on the CBOE site but its really confusing if i buy the data with 1 minute intervals will that show trade executions. I just want to make my case that the order did not execute when i placed it and since i cancelled it i should not be on the hook for it..",

        "selftext": "I apologize in advance for my terrible English, it is not my native language. I want to raise the FTD topic. The other day I had nothing to do and I started looking at all the stocks that had a short-squeeze this year. In addition to the GME and AMC (AMC - FTD 5.5%, and 3 months later a jump in the price of 3500%, GME - FTD 4,5%, after 2 months leap in price in 3000-4000%)\n\nWKHS: FTD 2%, and 2 months later a jump on 100%\n\nBBBY: FTD 1.7%, and after 3 months leap 300%\n\nPRTS: FTD-1.4%, after 3 months, a jump of 100%\n\nIn short, I sat like this, checked the companies, went through all the meme tickers of reddit, among other things. And at some point I caught myself that seeing the number of shares in FTD and the subsequent price jump after a while, I can roughly determine how many shares in the company are in circulation. And suddenly I guessed the approximate number of shares, well, give or take 20 million.\n\nAnd then I come to the palantir $ PLTR. I see that they had a jump in FTD of 20 million shares in February. But the price chart shows calm and silence. A huge number of shares in FTD and no impact on the price. I must admit, at that moment I was afraid. Did the theory fail? After all, in order for such a huge number of shares in FTD not to affect the price, the total number of shares in circulation should be huge. I looked at how many shares palantir has in turnover-1.8 billion, so FTD is about 1 percent, everything is fine.\n\nIn general, what I'm talking about: all companies whose FTD was at least about 2% had a jump after 2-4 months. In the case of GME and AMC and their FTD in the region of 5%, the growth was already in 3000-4000%. Oh, yes. Do you know what FTD CLOV had on July 8, to be precise? 12,8%. I will leave the conclusions to you, I will only say that I have not seen such a percentage in any company.\n\nSee for yourself how surprisingly the FTD chart and the price chart correlate\n\n[GME](https://preview.redd.it/08tu4vjtq5h71.jpg?width=1281&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84998519ce121e095c31eaa2813f44ae24f7576)\n\n[AMC](https://preview.redd.it/jb6nxuisq5h71.jpg?width=1487&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f1ac5b2faa741deed09701dc772af937656fc0)\n\n[WKHS](https://preview.redd.it/7ve3trerq5h71.jpg?width=1327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c25520667265563822bd45be01556a8ebc3009f2)\n\n[PRTS](https://preview.redd.it/1n4ql6dqq5h71.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418b5ee816d9cd01be854313cc584ff59652c72a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/g6l4024pq5h71.jpg?width=1320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ff362bffb0c0170e2a152ec8561a8d91df8746a)",

        "selftext": "## Introduction\n\nMartoma is born to Indian immigrant parents in Florida. Goes to Duke then gets into Harvard Law School. Gets kicked out of Harvard Law School for changing his grades, him \\*and his family\\* change their names and with his new name he finesses his way into Stanford Business School a year later.\n\nMartoma starts working for Steven A. Cohen at the infamous SAC Capital, and this is where he makes magic happen for a very short while, before getting caught. As an aside, it's weird to me that no news outlets have reported on his release since the prosecution of SAC Capital was so big at the time. \n\n## Mild connection to GameStop frenzy\n\nThe connection is not a big stretch IMO, basically the way my line of thinking works here is Mathew Martoma kept Steven A. Cohen (infamous for insider trading) out of jail by not throwing him under the bus. Cohen then mentors Gabe Plotkin and Gabe starts Melvin Capital. So, if Cohen was in jail then Melvin Capital would never have opened up shop, let alone be massively short GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's about it, some more details below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A bit more detail:\n\nMathew Martoma was behind one of the most profitable insider trading scandals in history with a profit of $276 million. \\[[link](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/02/07/former-sac-trader-found-guilty-insider-trading/6EIbg0eTH5Gawy2rnOBaFO/story.html)\\]\n\nMathew Martoma was quietly released from prison on July 19th on good behavior, according to his wiki page \\[[wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Martoma)\\]. I wasn't able to confirm it with any other news sources, but I did do an inmate search on him three weeks ago on [bop.gov](http://bop.gov/) (I've been following this dude's story for a while) and he came up then  \u2014  he doesn't come up anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## More detail about the GME connection\n\nGME had a high short interest which was a significant part of DFV's thesis \\[[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4)\\].\n\nOne of the biggest shorts (and losers) in this saga by dollar amount was  Melvin Capital (who have lost just over $5 billion YTD) and was later given $2.75BN just to keep running by Citadel and Steven A. Cohen \\[[link](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qm7508qzvkhd/Melvin-Capital-Added-to-GameStop-Shorts-as-WallStreetBets-Took-Aim)\\].\n\nMelvin Capital is run by Gabe Plotkin who was Steven A. Cohen's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.  No Cohen \u2192 No Plotkin \u2192 No Melvin \u2192 No massive GME short. Anecdotally, Plotkin actually overrode his analysts and himself made the decision to sell GME calls. \\[[link](https://twitter.com/goodalexander/status/1403342212180676609)\\]\n\n## Martoma's involvement with SAC Capital\n\nMathew Martoma made the insider trades using information about an Alzheimer's drug from two doctors \\[[link](https://annarborobserver.com/articles/the_corruption_of_sid_gilman_full_article.html)\\] including, a then professor at the University of Michigan, Sid Gilman.\n\nProsecutors find and grill Martoma to get Cohen, but Martoma doesn't give him up \\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/martoma-grain-sand-probe-sacs-010630030.html)\\]. Since they couldn't get Cohen, and there were no willing witnesses they went after the company itself and a few of the employees instead. If Martoma had given up Cohen then Cohen would be in prison and Melvin Capital would've never opened up shop.\n\n## Highlights from Martoma's life story\n\nMathew Martoma also has a little bit of an insane personal story (just lifting this off of wikipedia \\[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Martoma)\\] and Bloomberg \\[[link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-10/ex-sac-s-martoma-harvard-expulsion-revealed-on-trial-eve)\\]):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

Is applying to a clerkship for a federal appeals (ironic) court judge and changes a couple Bs to As cuz fuck it why not\n5. Gets caught, tells the registrar at school it was all \"just a joke\" (direct quote)\n6. Gets kicked out of Harvard Law School, but appeals\n7. Appeal fails, Martoma gets kicked out of Harvard\n8. Spends a year volunteering\n9. Changes his name to Mathew Martoma, and from 1994 to 2001 his parents and both of his siblings also change their last name to Martoma.

        "selftext": "^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features.\n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\nPrior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.\n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.\n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\nAt that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[$F Forecast illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/4733k5nepjf71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e263777020da87805e4761e2924dcb7ac69cad20)",

        "selftext": "Alright apes, taking a stab and fairly robust crayon-eating DD here. I've been following HOOD pretty closely, and it looks like HOOD's short-seller's are about to hit the giant brick wall that is their wives' boyfriends.  \n\n\nHOOD is the stock ticker for company named Robinhood. They're a small, undiscovered micro-cap stock in the fintech space as a mobile-first brokerage/trading platform. A retarded group of traders are angry at them because of a situation with another relatively unknown micro-cap called GameStop, and believe you me, this big beautiful group of retards absolutely hates money. So when HOOD IPOd a couple of weeks back, I expected these retards (they call themselves apes) to be spitefully short, no matter the cost. And you know what? They're even shorter than I could have imagined - this greasy bag of shit looks like it could blow up right in these crayon-eater's faces.  \n\n\nOne thing I've noticed over the past year is squeezes seem to happen on Wednesday of the third week of the month. If you go back and look at GME and AMC, you'll see what I mean. I've been told this is because monthlies, weeklies and futures are expire on this date? So that's when most margins are called? Well guess what this week is. It's the third week of the month and that Wednesday is two days away. Making things even more interesting, HOOD, a fresh and highly-volatile IPO is set to report their first ever earnings after-hours this Wednesday.  \n\n\nThis is in no shape or form financial advice, I literally have no clue what the fuck I'm doing. Got it? Cool. Let's roll that beautiful bean footage.  \n\n\nAccording to Ortex, shorts are currently only able to borrow around 17.5 million total shares. The shorts have been at 100% utilization for the last 6 days. Is that a lot? I don't know. I know they only IPOd with 55 million shares. I have no clue if that's how many shares are currently in the public float. If it is, that's a lot (31.8%), and on par with several other current meme stonks like AMC. That said, I don't really think float matters in this case.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xytvp6szjsh71.png?width=1958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=004300f9899d751ba6ee5613712423972fbd5cb9\n\nOrtex TLDR: All 17.5 million shares available for short-selling look to be already shorted. \n\nCross-referencing this info with Fintel, it seems to align.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtwuunb0lsh71.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1c8d42524ee30fe850264f50a0e93a5b5834922\n\n  \nAs far as I can tell, HOOD is becoming harder and harder to short making it incredibly hard to artificially deflate the price. \n\nThe other thing giant red baboon butt stat in the bunch is the Cost To Borrow Rate. Ortex has this anywhere between 46.97 and 86.47%, with an average of 66.93%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4va6ae1zmsh71.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76f05783f91c1bd25fe692d0977021ed23ee4ce6\n\n66.93%...\n\nYour mom said that's really expensive. She said, \"At a 67% borrow rate, @ a $49 share price, the stock would have to drop to $16.17 per share just for these shorts to break even\". I don't know her that math works out, but if does, you probably have better odds at breeding miniature horse ducks.\n\nThat's a lot of bleeding, I'd think that means these shorts need to make their money quick.\n\nNot necessarily believing either of these garbage platforms, I decided to try and short a HOOD share myself, just to see what E-Trade told me. Here's what I got.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2h1dlh9dmsh71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c26aecb48b5a93665a9d1e89320c5a91b5c797\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bofdnd9dmsh71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a97d6bf85ab15d9f6b7daf04387be58fc17b1d3\n\nAn estimated borrow rate of 48%. While that's not the 67% Ortex is touting, that's wayyyyy more than the standard 0.2 to 1% you'll find on other stocks like APPL, Z or SFIX.\n\nAnother point is the short-shares changing of hands seems to be slowing. I don't know these crayon eaters have managed to swap out 4 - 8 million short-shares while keeping utilization at 100%, but good golly they've been done doing it. Ortex and Fintel give you different numbers, but either way you cut the baby it looks like the swapping is slowing down today.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdmmzqtoqsh71.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5290a8eaf88a40d96bc52b06e1abc203885c463\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1c18stoqsh71.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66800ab1017dffc68775ca856d7da23aaa8702b\n\nNow what does all this mean? No fuckin idea. My best guess, I'd think volatility will increase going into earnings, and at that high of a borrow rate with that few of shares to short available, I wouldn't think the share price needs much movement to the upside to really start squeezing some balls. I guess we'll find out.  \n\n\nTLDR: Am retarded. Help. Not in any way financial advice.",

        "selftext": "# I. Introduction\n\nI think the **hardest part about trading is that the market is constantly evolving**. We are creatures of habit, as a result we get complacent and think we can find a single, comfortable strategy that works an infinite amount of times. This is almost never the case; different market conditions call for different approaches**.** By combining this post with my last, you should **obtain a basic understanding of how you can read market conditions, and adapt with the market.**\n\nIf you [read my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TickerWizards/comments/p24uma/follow_the_money_how_to_catch_every_rotation_and/), you now know when money is flowing into equities, and when it is flowing into bonds, the dollar and other safe havens. You also know about the different indexes, and what basket of stocks they carry. You even know about some interesting correlations that have arisen recently related to tech and a risk off rotation.\n\nIn this one - I'm going to take it a step further, and dig a little deeper, showing you all how to tell exactly which types equities money is flowing to, and **how to use that to generate high probability trades.** In this era of passive indexation, **you are almost never just buying one stock**. You are buying one stock - and every stock correlated to it. That means, **when you are buying CLOV and PLTR - you are also buying WISH, BB, AMC, UWMC and GME.** This obviously is not a category of stocks by traditional means - but in recent times it has become one. The point is - **you are going all in on one stock and you don't even realize it.**\n\nTo avoid this phenomenon - you need to understand the different different industries present within the market. Equities all belong to at least one of these - **and will usually track the rest of the stocks within their respective industry quite closely.**\n\n# II. The Eleven Sectors That Define The Market\n\nThere is generally believed to be eleven different sectors that equities belong to. In this section, I'll detail what each one is, **the ETF you can use to track it**, and what environment it usually outperforms in.\n\nAlso, there's two main categories for stocks: **cyclicals - which follow the business cycle, and non-cyclicals - which perform the same year round.**\n\n# 1 - Energy (VDE)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The energy sector is a category of stocks that relate to producing or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry also includes integrated power utility companies such as renewable energy and coal.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, this sector is dominated by the oil industry. You will notice renewables will hardly effect it's price movements a vast majority of the time. While many are trying to shift away from oil, it will likely be a massive part of our economy and our market long into the future.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nIn most situations - the energy sector is cyclical. This means when our economy is doing well and expanding - it will perform well.  When it isn't, the reverse is true. Because it is dominated by a commodity, energy companies also have no issue passing on inflation to their consumers. However, keep in mind this one is a bit special because of OPEC and their ability to influence price.\n\n\"OPEC is a cartel that **aims to manage the supply of oil** in an effort to set the price of oil on the world market, in order to avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\nBasically, they have most of the oil, and fix the prices to their liking. This can have some unforeseen effects on the market, so if you are trading energy you definitely want to monitor their movements.\n\n# 2 - Materials (VAW)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products,\u00a0and forestry products.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThe materials sector is cyclical. It is sensitive to changes in the economy and tracks it pretty closely. This is another sector that can easily pass inflation onto their consumers due to the nature of their products. It's also going to be especially sensitive to any changes in the supply and demand of raw materials worldwide.\n\n# 3 - Industrials (VIS)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The industrial goods sector includes stocks of companies that mainly produce capital goods used in manufacturing, resource extraction, and construction. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, the materials sector passes raw materials to the industrials sector - which converts them to products used to manufacture the final products passed on to consumers.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it is so closely tied to how much companies are producing - this sector is also cyclical. This is yet another sector that can pass the costs of inflation onto their consumers. Subsequently, due to it's close ties with the materials sector - it will be especially sensitive to the supply and demand of raw materials.\n\n# 4 - Consumer Discretionary (VCR)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nEssentially, anything broke people can't afford, like those who went all in on WISH calls before earnings, goes in this basket.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it depends on the income of consumers - this is also a cyclical sector. When the economy is thriving, people will have more money to blow on non-essential goods, like $120 Lululemon shorts, or tickets to Disney World.\n\n# 5 -  Consumer Staples (VDC)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically the opposite of consumer discretionary - these are things people **NEED** not things that they **WANT.**\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThese are non-cyclical, or defensive - which means regardless of how the economy is doing they will perform more or less the same. This means when the economy is taking a turn for the worst, they will generally outperform the other sectors. This doesn't mean they are immune to business cycle changes entirely, but they are certainly much less affected by them.\n\n# 6 - Health Care (VHT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. The healthcare sector is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for close to a fifth of overall gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. healthcare sector benefits from a strong system of medical research and development, in cooperation with the higher education system and the technology industry. The aging U.S. population and the advancing senescence of the Baby Boomer generation are driving ongoing strong demand in the healthcare sector.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis one is a bit complicated because there are a few industries within the sector, namely: medical equipment, drug R&amp;D, and health insurance. The sector is non-cyclical - but each industry has it's own quirks.\n\nThe drug industry in particular often moves independently of everything else on the market, because it is highly dependent on new developments and news pieces related to potentially groundbreaking treatments. Health insurance and medical equipment is usually non-negotiable regardless of the business cycle - so it will outperform in times of economic distress, and generally perform the same year round.\n\n# 7 - Financials (VFH)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The financial sector is a section of the economy\u00a0made up of\u00a0firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This\u00a0sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBanks involve the supply and demand of money. They make money through fees and interest rate spreads. Banks perform well during economic expansion when companies and individuals are borrowing money. One of the main drivers of borrowing/lending is interest rates. In a rising rate environment (observed through TNX, TLT, US treasury yield curve), banks will outperform. They pay short term rates (front of curve) on their deposits, and lend money to companies or individuals at a higher interest rate (further out on the curve) capturing a difference or \"spread\" on interest paid vs received. Understanding treasury yields and how they are related to the daily price movements in the financial sector is a great place to start.\n\n# 8 - Information Technology (VGT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nThis one really needs no introduction.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is a bit tricky due to some correlations that have arisen from 2020 onward. For most of history - most tech stocks were cyclical. However, due to COVID, extremely low interest rates, and some other factors - these assets are now being rotated into during a risk off environment - and are seen as a safe-haven. Who knows if this will stand, but it's important to understanding when money will flow there **today.** More on this can be found in my previous post, where I go into detail on this phenomenon.\n\n# 9 - Communication Services (VOX)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio, or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and Internet service providers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is another non-cyclical sector. Whether the economy is good or bad - people aren't going to give up communicating with each other. In today's world, everyone needs a phone - even if it's a flip phone - and everyone needs internet access. One of the interesting parts of this sectors is that it is comprised of both growth names and income names. While the larger names are more consistent with dividends, the smaller names often have more room for capital appreciation and earnings growth.\n\n# 10 - Utilities (VPU)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. It is a large sector, and an important part of the U.S. economy, with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion (as of March 2021). Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service landscape\u2014providing as they do such staples for daily living\u2014and are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to generate a steady income for their portfolios.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nYet another non-cyclical basket of stocks. Regardless of the business cycle, demand for utilities almost always remains constant. These are some of the most stable stocks on the market - so WSB is probably better going to forget they exist moments after reading this post.\n\n# 11 - Real Estate (VNQ)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made\u2014including water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nLike most industries, real estate involves the supply and demand of property, both residential and commercial. Real Estate is closely related to changes in construction or development, but also heavily influenced by interest rates. Most participants are using Loan to Value (LTV), anywhere from 60-85% of the total property value; therefore, interest rate changes will impact participants' ability to borrow. Thinking through these variables, its safe to assume that real estate performs well in low interest rate environments, low-moderate commodity prices for construction, population growth, and government (both local and federal) infrastructure support. When rates rise, the debt burden increases and money is hard to borrow; which ultimately affect the ability to invest in new projects or purchase homes. \n\n# III. Practical Applications\n\nTo use all of this information - and convert it to probabilities I can use to trade - **I perform technical analysis on each sector ETF using the 1 year 1 day chart (swing trade timeframe)**. If one is breaking out of a large setup - I can assume money is going to move there in the future. If others are forming nice setups - I know to add them to my watchlist.\n\nAfter identifying a sector that is likely to become strong in the near future - **I then filter it further by finding particular stocks within the sector that have similar setups**. I usually look through the top holdings of the ETF pertaining to the sector. I do this because individual stocks are more volatile than sector ETFs and more liquid - which means there is more money to be made. If a particular stock is lagging behind the sector, it can also mean there is even more to gain than in the case of another name.\n\nYou can take this one step further and combine information from my previous posts by identifying whether we are risk on, or risk off. Cyclicals are generally going to outperform while we are risk on. Non-cyclicals will generally outperform while we are risk off.\n\n**Example -**\n\nLast week - I noticed financials were breaking out of a large falling wedge on the daily chart. This has a bullish bias - and indicates price will make a strong move in the near future. I didn't have to scan the ETF for this one, since all the stocks in it are household names.\n\n[VFH \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/f8lboux5r5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d82ab4b17cc79ada84ec6e65473fd1eac870309)\n\nI also noticed BAC had formed a bull flag. This was all the information I needed to enter some October Calls which I closed today for a nice profit.\n\n[BAC \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/fjfynyv7r5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e0cb7ec1e5d05729cf3e41382c8591662a896e)\n\nLastly, ZB was trending downwards and yields were rising. This was an environment banks outperform in - which means it enforced my probability of success even more.\n\n[ZB \\(Bonds\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/6wwok3sbr5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596609c73c6bbfdfc01392c6262a9bb8044cb204)\n\nYou don't have to use technical analysis. This is just my preference. Many people use complex fundamental and economic analysis to determine these rotations. The important thing is understanding the environments particular sectors will outperform in.\n\n# IV. Closing Thoughts\n\nLet me first apologize for the wall of text. I'll do my best to summarize it for those with short attention spans in my TL;DR.\n\nIf you got through all of this, and my last post - hopefully you have a better understanding of tracking where money is going, and using that to make higher quality trades. I think this is a topic most of WSB doesn't know exists (or doesn't believe in) which causes them to lose lots of money because they are all in on meme stocks, and meme stocks haven't been in the rotation for a little while. That's not to say they won't ever be again - but for the time being the broader market has made all time highs almost daily whilst these names continue to puke their guts out.\n\n# V. TL;DR\n\nThere's **11 sectors** within the stock market.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Energy **(VDE, Cyclical)**\n2. Materials **(VAW, Cyclical)**\n3. Industrials **(VIS, Cyclical)**\n4. Consumer Discretionary **(VCR, Cyclical)**\n5. Consumer Staples **(VDC, Non-Cyclical)**\n6. Healthcare **(VHT, Non-Cyclical)**\n7. Financials **(VFH, Cyclical)**\n8. Information Technology **(VGT, Cyclical Most Of The Time)**\n9. Communication Services **(VOX, Non-Cyclical)**\n10. Utilities **(VPU, Non-Cyclical)**\n11. Real Estate **(VNQ, Cyclical)**\n\nEach one will be rotated into depending on different market conditions. Understanding this is important to being able to make money at any given time. I perform technical analysis to determine when each is being rotated into, but you can use any analysis you want.",

Only running for a few months, it was used as a test-bed to find out more about European trading. \n\n[TechCrunch 2019 - RobinHood gets UK license](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/robinhood-fca/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKG7momxcnbzlJ6EJPxz7t0Ux6sSkRffw06WEHg6HLH6mEVcRAwmuKh-l6iar_yuxYhHI3OEVvm72ziwkLocRvJCHvJxKoYFgrUFqquFSLy71LwgCaDQrMpPb2QX6cdT6UB3-MD-HLPZwNq5HSXNUtWqRvjNs3jsS5593QBP0yVE)\n\nIn 2020, amidst all of the Covid chaos, RH announced that they were postponing the UK launch 'Indefinitely'. \n\n[robinhood.com/uk/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-uk/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, using this knowledge, combined with my extreme autism and a dash of confirmation bias. I believe this is the next move for RH. \n\nWhy else would they have recently launched their IPO. Could it be because RobinHood is a shady company that robs people of their money and is under legal pressures after the events of the last year; that is possible. But I don't care, because my only interest is the share price of the stock, and the number of zero's at the end of my bank balance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition- $1420 @ 1:5 leverage. \n\nDisclaimer- I don't even use RH, I'm just a autistic Europoor chasing tendies",
