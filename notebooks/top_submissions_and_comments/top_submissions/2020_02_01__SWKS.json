What if Apple backs out and keeps Skyworks out of the next cycle of iPhones. One contract loss means -40% revenue is extremely unsettling. \n\nOn the other hand Qualcomm is more diversified. Their chips are used by every major phone brand. However, it seems like Huawei is starting a shift to producing their own internals which will likely hurt Qualcomms earnings. \n\nPlease discuss.
