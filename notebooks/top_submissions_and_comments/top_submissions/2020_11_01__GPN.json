        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

[TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)\n\nAs you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

I know they are one of the best video conferencing apps out there, but I believe they will have a lot of problem due to a number of free apps that also offer great quality while the company is trading at insane p/e numbers. I know this trend is here to stay, but I thing there are far better play in the stock market out there rather than Zoom at this price point.

[TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)\n\nAs you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "I am a known massive proponent for the transaction fintechs, and have written a multitude of posts on them in the last 3 years. Apart from diligent financial analysis and modeling, the largest reason for these massive long positions is Sweden.\n\nSweden is a world leader of digital payments, spawning multiple large fintechs platforms, such as Swish (Sweden domestic only), Klarna (Global payments), and iZettle (PayPal acquisition). As one of the world leaders of fintech, I use what works in Sweden to project into the US.\n\nIn the latest Central Bank (Riksbanken) report, Swish (Swedish Venmo/Cashapp) has surpassed total cash usage. It's used eveywhere, by everyone. Combine this potential future with Cashapp and Venmo (both of which show profitable margins), the potential for Square &amp; PayPal is much larger than is currently priced in. These stocks may look very over valued as of now, if you draw a line between where their e wallets are now to where swish is in Sweden, they have very very far to go.\n\nSQ is especially hot as of this week after a smash earnings, but I have a massive conviction that this isn't the last smash quarter they will have. Over the next 5 years I am extremely confident they will both outperform the market in raw e-wallet growth. For the first time, cash will be monitized by private corporations. You don't want to miss it.\n\nI mostly made this post for people who doesn't know how far e wallets have come in frontiers. In 5 years, cash will be very very close to dead in sweden. In 20, it'll be gone. Someone will profit and perhaps become the visa / Mastercard of the new age. \n\nPs: \"hur durr bitcoin &amp; crypto will deseat fiat currencies\". PayPal and Square are the two largest corporations currently investing heavily into crypto. If the stable cryptocurrencies is part of our fintech future, no large company will profit as much as they. Get in.\n\nDisclosure: Gargantuan Square position and large PayPal.",

        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don\u2019t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

[TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)\n\nAs you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

SOURCE:**\n\n[It's in the article linked to in my Tweet in my Thread here](https://twitter.com/olejonbj/status/1328789813378551809?s=19) or [read it directly here](https://www.miamiherald.com/article247234629.html).\n\nWhat would the market &amp; company situation have been for Phunware if investors knew back then?\n\nAfter e.g. [Honeywell confirmed the partnership Phunware claimed they have gotten with them was FAKE](https://twitter.com/honeywell/status/1313952992991870982?s=19), asking Phunware over a month ago to take it down, *but they don't*, getting a similar answer from HPE would be much bigger.\n\nThis is kind of a follow-up to an [article in The New Yorker I was a main source to](https://www.newyorker.com/news/campaign-chronicles/the-trump-campaigns-mobile-app-is-collecting-massive-amounts-of-voter-data), published September 13 (yes I have clearance to take credit in public as my name was supposed to be there - it accidentally was taken out), but the *Actual News Outlet behind this article*, has obviously, well, more resources. I've been contacted because of my Thread by journalists, though can't say which ones, but I do help out wherever I can. \n\nMy Thread was really just going to look into the app, but Phunware popped up immediately and had to be looked into. A lot outside my knowledge there, so little by little in the Thread, with help from some anonymous sources and journalists. As you may know, Twitter Threads can't be edited later, so, *better look from the Last to the First Tweet in the Thread*.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: I'm not an investor, not a US Citizen, although Phunware thinks so, that I am 2 actually, with my skills it's not that hard. Reason for posting here: I kept getting results from this subreddit on certain searches when searching basics.*",

        "selftext": "My father worked at IBM for 30 years back in the day, and somehow acquired only one share of stock along the way. He died a few years ago, and my mother keeps receiving quarterly checks for less than $2.00.  She can't deposit them because they're in his name, and the process to get the share transferred to her name costs more than the share is worth because she needs to replace the lost certificate first.  She's stuck in one-share-limbo because it doesn't seem worth the time or the money to transfer the share, but every three months she gets re-annoyed and we end up having yet another conversation about whether or not she should go through the process. \n\nWhat would you do?",
