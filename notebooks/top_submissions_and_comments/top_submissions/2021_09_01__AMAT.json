        "selftext": "Hey!\nI got into investing a month ago where I transferred all the money I had saved into my account. Since I'm only 13 that was only $1,500 but it's better than nothing I guess. I invested $1000 into NVDA right before earnings so I'm doing pretty great so far.\n\nBut what should my next investment be? I was thinking TSM, AMD, ASML and AMAT. Which one would you recommend long term? I'm thinking about investing $200 a month since that is what I earn on my job. My investment strategy was to lump sum $1000 into one of these stocks at a time until I have $1000 in each. Does that sound like a good idea?",

        "selftext": "Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. \n\nMy question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: \n\n$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. \n\n$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. \n\nSemiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. \n\nWhat are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",

        "selftext": "I looking to put some money into SemiC sector, but I am having trouble deciding which companies I should go for. I did some analysis for long term investments, and from what I see NVDA, AMD, ASML and AMAT is the way to go. The only thing I am having trouble understanding if high P/E is indicating that stocks are overvalued or that is just very high from recent growth. If i took into account high P/E, that would indicate that AMD and AMAT is the best potential for long growth, while NVDA and ASML should slow down quite a lot.\n\nAlso I heard about NVDA ARM deal, which should go down soon, that would bone AMD quite bad, and AMD is merging XLNX which should impact AMD quite well by the end of the year.\n\nIm leveraging myself towards AMD, but maybe I misunderstand what I see.

        "selftext": "Several times this year **SPY** has broken through the lower end of its' upward sloping channel.  On 1/29, 3/4, 6/18, 7/19 the price fell below the SMA 50 on the daily chart, and closed below it.\n\nEach time **SPY** bounced back the following day, reestablishing the 50 as a major line of support for the ETF.  After the next day closed above support, the market continued on to establish a new ATH.\n\nWill that happen on Monday?  We will soon find out, but I certainly hope it doesn't.\n\nIf **SPY** continues to drop, it will be the first time this year that a break of major support had continuation.  At that point, 436 and 431.78 become the next two targets for a major breach.\n\nEither way - *do not anticipate a move, wait for confirmation before acting on it.* In other words, don't start buying *calls* or going long on **/ES** futures thinking you can predict a bottom.  You can't.  It will become clear when **SPY** has established support and it's ready to rebound.\n\nHere's what you should be doing though - making your list of stocks that are gaining strength ahead of **SPY**.  Stocks like **UPST, ETSY,** and **DASH** have all been pushing upwards during this market decline.   The next list should be of stocks that that are currently holding major support areas (**MSFT, FB,** and **AMZN** for example) - these stocks have been dragged down by a bearish market trend, but also have been able to hold support (unlike **AAPL** which broke through).\n\nWhen **SPY** finally does finds support, this is your opportunity for some high probability trades.  An opportunity you do not want to waste by trying to get ahead of it.\n\nThis means that the first thing you will need to do is, *be patient*.  This is much harder to do than it sounds of course.  You'll see **SPY** bouncing back up and watching the stocks on your list bounce up with it.  At this point you might think, \"I am missing it, I need to get in now!\".  *No you don't*.  Wait.  Make sure the market isn't just chopping around, and then getting ready for another leg down. Much like it did from Monday - Thursday of last week.\n\nWhen the market finally begins to reverse it will be clear - and it is at this point you want to start putting on Put Credit Spreads, Call Debit Spreads, Straight Calls, and Long Stock among those tickers you have been watching.  For example - let's say the market continues to drop and heads down to 431 (SMA 100), where it stabilizes and then begins to bounce back upwards.  At the same point you notice that **AMZN** is resting on it's SMA 100 around 3400.  As the market starts to go back up, so will **AMZN**, most likely recapturing its SMA 50 (3450).  You could do a Put Credit Spread of 3395/3390 for 3 weeks out and probably get a credit of roughly $1.50 for it, which is a 43% ROI.  You'll have two major lines of support above your short strike, giving you a lot of cushion on this trade.  You could also do a Call Debit Spread ATM of 3455/3460 for a debit under $2.50, as well.  Your risk is defined by your debit, which is less than 50% of the distance in the strike prices.\n\nPerhaps **MSFT** dropped down to $292, right on its SMA 50, and is also showing Relative Strength to **SPY** \\- if so you can do a one month out ITM calls with a delta of .7 or higher (probably a strike around $270).\n\nMake sure you aren't too heavy into any single sector, and you have stocks like **MCD** and **AMAT** in your list as well.\n\nWhat you want is to have several bullish plays ready to go across various sectors, and when you see **SPY** once again push upwards, you should be aggressively pulling the trigger on these trades.  *Again - not until you have confirmed that* ***SPY*** *has found support.*\n\nDrops like these provide the best buying opportunities but so often people are either unprepared for them or jump in too early.  Last Thursday (9/16), I saw many traders assume that the drop was over given the previous pattern on **SPY** and as such they started executing a number of bullish swing trades, including Calls on **SPY**.  Needless to say, on Friday their accounts took a serious hit.  Why?  Because **SPY** did not confirm a reversal, just consolidation.\n\nThere are several areas of horizontal support/resistance for **SPY**,  downward sloping trendlines you can draw on the daily chart, and major SMA's to guide you - it should not be unclear to anyone when **SPY** reverses.  On Thursday, the market breached none of these lines - so there was no reason to get bullish on it.\n\nObviously these drops provide excellent Day Trading opportunities - on Friday for example, **ZM** began to go up around noon (est) as **SPY** continued to chop around, indicating Relative Strength to the market.  At 2pm (est), that strength is confirmed with **SPY** dropping and **ZM** holding its' bid.  That ticker provided several excellent *Day Trading* entries and exits throughout the day.  **UPST** and **ETSY** were similar.  In fact, days that **SPY** is bearish give you the best insight into stocks that are strong against the market and ready to really go once that get a tailwind behind them.\n\nMany short-term traders shy away from price action like this on **SPY** and that would be a mistake.  *Day Trade* these drops with strong stocks, *Swing Trade* the reversal with high probability option plays.\n\n\\*Obviously you can and should *Day Trade* the reversal as well, but that is just a matter of looking for RS/RW as **SPY** is rebounding.\n\n\\*\\*Also note that when I refer to Relative Strength I am not talking about RSI or Beta.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 8, 2021**\n\n*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide.

        "selftext": "This is an unplanned supplement to my prior DD on the eve of Rocket Lab\u2019s de-spac. \n\nI had dozens of comments listing key points/catalysts that I had initially missed, because I was keen on being the first to post a legal DD about rocket lab (SPACs aren\u2019t allowed so when I first posted it months ago, it was taken down). In addition, there has been interesting news regarding the space launch industry as a whole, specifically with respect to satellite constellation launches for providing greater accessibility to affordable high bandwidth internet, all over the world (yay), and real-time global surveillance via satellites with 50cm camera precision (kinda &amp; oh no).\n\nNews\n1. Amazon Project Kuiper \ud83d\udd25 - Amazon had announced its own internet satellite constellation project to launch 3k satellites by 2026-2029. Initial 6 or 9 flights assigned to ULA. RKLB\u2019s constellation supporting rocket, Neutron, is set to be ready to launch in 2024, ready in time to *maybe* capture some business from Amazon IN ADDITION to all of the ISPs that are going to be banging launch providers doors down, to not get left out of the next great revolution in global internet coverage. \n2. RKLB\u2019s space systems business \ud83d\udc40 - RKLB just announced it had signed a deal to supply reaction wheels \u201cfor a number of undisclosed satellite constellations.\u201d AFAIK satellites need 3 reaction wheels to control their orientation on all 3 axes (keeping a 4th as backup). Their production facility at initial capacity will output 2000 a year. 2000 / 4 == 500 satellites a year they are expecting to provision. For reference they\u2019ve only launched 100 satellites themselves so far.\n3. Astra (ASTR) \ud83d\ude2a - had 2 failed launches last weekend in a row, still haven\u2019t made it to orbit, still valued at about 1/2 that of rocket lab (what is wrong with this market). Launch reliability should have a premium, rocket lab has a proven track record of launch reliability.\n4. Firefly (private) \ud83d\ude2a - watching their livestream of launch right now, and it\u2019s not going too well (called an abort). But we\u2019ll see how it goes\u2026\n\nSome Key Upcoming Events\n1. September 8, Earnings \ud83c\udf7f - likely will hear status updates regarding larger neutron rocket, as well as their space systems business (please tell us about the contracts regarding reaction wheels mentioned above).\n2. Lunar Mission 2021 (probably Q4) \ud83c\udf1d - do I even have to say anything? What other space startup is set to fly to the moon this year, for NASA? What doors will this open for them \ud83d\udeaa?\n3. September-October, Back to back to back launches for global surveillance company Black Sky \ud83d\udc40 - this is very interesting as rocket lab has never turned around rockets this fast before. Demonstrating extremely rapid launch cadence will be proving to customer that they can schedule launch on demand essentially. In months, eventually weeks but not years. I expect to also see rocket lab demonstrate reusability of their electron rockets, by catching some with a helicopter (not joking) \ud83d\ude81.\n\nSummary:\n1. Rocket lab is in a much better position than other space startups that are either still in theoretical phase (never launched), and those that are trying to launch but just can\u2019t seem to get their rockets flying straight (Astra).\n2. Entrance of tech giants and ISP heavy weights into satellite constellation business is evidence that we are on the brink of a satellite launching party (from all ISPs to avoid getting amazoned, and want to keep their consistently high cash flow business models: Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc.). From all the launches, the planet might heat up a few degrees \ud83d\ude13.\n3. Their neutron rocket is being developed at the right time to compete with SpaceX for launch contracts for such constellations (I also really doubt any one launch provider has the bandwidth to take all the contracts).\n4. Their space systems business (reaction wheels for one), will be a nice revenue stream, even for the satellites that they don\u2019t launch themselves, yet still develop and produce key parts of.\n\nPositions/Disclosure: I have a lot of shares",

        "selftext": "Alright Apes, this is following on from my DD a few days ago, RKLB price has grown about 40% since then. Results have just been announced and there's some real nice stuff in there, I've tried to condense it a bit below and highlight the best bits.\n\nRevenue is not that high and this is to be expected, they're a growing company furiously investing in their future. Still profitable though which can't be said of SPCE, ASTR and Blue Origin. Backlog has shot up (137%), lots of work to keep them busy and keep the money coming in.\n\nThe most important thing is the amount of diversification. Their Space Systems business has grown significantly. They are quickly becoming a full service launch provider. You could argue they're more diverse than Space X in some regards. This is why I think they're such a safe long term bet. In the short term though, as more people are learning about them, the price is shooting up so there is money to be made. I'm personally targeting $30 a share short term and even that is conservative as that still values them well under SPCE at its' peak, and SPCE is nowhere near as valuable a stock as RKLB\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Revenue of $29.5M, representing 237% Year-on-Year revenue growth, accompanied by an expansion in gross margins from negative 67% to a* ***positive 13%****.*\n\n***Increasing diversity in revenue****, with Space Systems contributing 18% of total revenue in the period, compared to 3% in the prior year, accompanied with gross margins of 65%.*\n\n***Backlog grew 136% Year-on-Year to $141.4 million as of June 30, 2021 as compared to backlog of $59.9 million as of June 30, 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Entered into a contract with Varda Space Industries to manufacture and operate three Photon spacecraft to enable **in-space manufacturing**.\n* Entered into a contract with BlackSky Global for five Electron launches to support their **constellation growth**.\n* Entered into a study contract for a **Mars mission** that will see Rocket Lab develop two Photon spacecraft in support of the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory for a NASA science mission.\n* Successfully **recovered an Electron booster** for the second time, further advancing the program to make Electron a reusable launch vehicle to increase launch cadence and reduce cost per mission.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince June 30, 2021 Rocket Lab also:\n\n* Entered into a contract with Kin\u00e9is for five Electron launches to deploy their entire constellation of 25 satellites.\n* Signed launch services agreements to deploy satellites for Alba Orbital and Aurora Propulsion Technologies.\n* Began construction on a new **high volume production line capable of producing up to 2,000 reaction wheels per year** to support a growing number of contracts with constellation customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npositions: 500 shares/average $10.50",
