It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***At Close of Thursday***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tMA\tMastercard Inc\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMKTX\tMarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMSCI\tMsci Inc\n* BMS\tBraemar Shipping Services plc\n* CSRA\tCisadane Sawit Raya PT\n\n*Maybe*:\n\n* CRSR\tCorsair Gaming Inc\n* TWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tFLT\tFleetCor Technologies, Inc.\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tGPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tJKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* Environmental &amp; Facilities Services\tROL\tRollins, Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tCME\tCME Group Inc\n* Health Care Equipment\tBDX\tBecton Dickinson and Co\n* Health Care Equipment\tDXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* Industrial Conglomerates\tROP\tRoper Technologies Inc\n* Interactive Media &amp; Services\tTWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Internet Services &amp; Infrastructure\tVRSN\tVerisign, Inc.\n* Managed Health Care\tHUM\tHumana Inc\n* Pharmaceuticals\tPRGO\tPerrigo Company PLC\n* Restaurants\tDPZ\tDomino's Pizza, Inc.\n* Restaurants\tMCD\tMcdonald's Corp\n* Research &amp; Consulting Services\tINFO\tIHS Markit Ltd\n* TYL\tTyler Technologies, Inc.\n* DPZ\tDomino's Pizza, Inc.\n* DXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* JKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* GPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* FB\tFacebook, Inc.

        "selftext": "**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    \n    \n# Analysis:    \nHappy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I\u2019m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I\u2019ve bought outright calls. Here is what I\u2019m seeing with Apple: \n    \n## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    \nWhat kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter do to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here\u2019s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    \n    \n## The \u201csuper cycle\u201d rumors appear to be true.    \nAs a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn\u2019t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a \u201csuper cycle\u201d of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I\u2019ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     \n    \n[Here\u2019s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush\u2019s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   \n    \nHere are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don\u2019t read around here.    \n&gt;\"Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds \u2026 **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,\" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    \n    \n&gt;Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a \"stretch goal\" in the mid-80 million range.    \n    \n&gt;Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is \"north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards \u2013 an eye popping figure)\" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    \n    \n&gt;**\"We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.\"**.   \n    \n[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   \nNotable quote:    \n&gt; That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    \n    \n    \nIt\u2019s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    \n    \n## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   \nIt\u2019s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it\u2019s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   \n    \n## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.\nSee further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201crisks\u201d sections.    \n    \n    \n\nApple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here\u2019s a Barron\u2019s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    \n\n    \n    \nApple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that\u2019s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn\u2019t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you\u2019re \u201callowed\u201d to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. \n   \n\nThose are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn\u2019t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   \n    \n## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace\nI can\u2019t track down the things I\u2019ve read here and there on Twitter and I\u2019m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple\u2019s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    \n    \n## App sales are crushing it.   \nThanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     \n\n## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     \nThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that\u2019s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. AT&amp;T may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d for them.    \n    \nApple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     \n    \nIt is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.\n    \n# RISKS\n**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    \nI don\u2019t know.  Based on the reports I\u2019ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn\u2019t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn\u2019t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand}.(https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     \n    \n    \n\n**Macro factors causing a crash**.    \nA lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don\u2019t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it\u2019s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    \n    \n\nI\u2019m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    \n    \nAs we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late \u201821 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it\u2019s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don\u2019t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. \n    \nA much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.\n\n**Bad subscription numbers**    \n\nIf subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn\u2019t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. \n\n**Sales could have cratered in October**    \n\nSales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I\u2019m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don\u2019t really know what October sales look like.\n\n**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    \n\n[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that\u2019s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.\n\n##  Technical Analysis   \nI don\u2019t believe in technical analysis. Charts don\u2019t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person. \n\n## Fun rumors    \nI\u2019m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that\u2019s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn\u2019t really my cup of tea, but if it\u2019s yours those are two things to consider. \n\n## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    \nI\u2019m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn\u2019t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent \u201cto the moon\u201d meme stocks) with limited float. (That\u2019s not to say those aren\u2019t great companies or great trades. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019).\n\n\n## My positions: \nI\u2019m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you\u2019d expect.    \n    \nI have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 APPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that\u2019s going to sit there for the next two years.\n\nBut I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     \n    \nThis puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.\n\n## How to get rich\nI intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don\u2019t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    \n    \nI intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.\n\n## Criticism    \nIf you think I\u2019m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I don\u2019t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If I\u2019m wrong, I want to know it. \n\n## The Most Important Factor    \n\nThis ain\u2019t my first day around here, and I know that DD is absolutely useless without rocketships, therefore: APPLE TO THE \ud83c\udf19  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.     \n\n\n\nGodspeed, fellow autists.",

So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA).

No company outside of 'Murica or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits in Quebec are pretty fucking insane, but other than that you are right. The good thing is that it ain't gonna be Canadian-based much longer.

Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).\n\n\n\n#*So, why the FUCK should I care?* \n\n\n**Because fucking Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care, idiot.** \n\n\nNews silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on 'silently' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a PR team full of slimy fuckers. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). \n\n**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** \n\nAnd, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla's truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon's facilities, and most importantly they are already ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market.

[A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not mention Lion in the peer comparison section, as they would've admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) \n\n\n**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion's revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra's entire revenue in 2025.**\n\nAnyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be shitting out school buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.\n\n\n\n#*Why should I buy RIGHT FUCKING NOW?*\n\n**Because tomorrow may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**\n\nJim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TOMORROW](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this shit fucking takes off. It is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going the pump the shit out of Lion tomorrow, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. \n\n**How do I know $NGA will pump so hard?** The CEO of Lion featured on a [local news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I'm sure none of you idiots understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy will send this shit to the moon and beyond \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a. \n\n**Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.**\n\n\n\n#*But why should I FUCKING pick Lion Electric over all the other EV stocks that get spammed here?*\n\n\n\n**Because Lion Electric offers much more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes**\n\n\n\n\u00b7 There are currently 7 different [trucks and buses](https://imgur.com/L1cu6oS) **available for purchase**\n\n\n\u00b7 They already have **300+ vehicles on the road** today with over \n  6mil miles between them \n\n\n\u00b7 Multi-year deal agreement for **Amazon** to purchase up to \n  2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger \n  and more lucrative opportunities afterwards\n\n\n\u00b7 **CN (huge Canadian transporter)** recently Purchased 50 \n  trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later\n\n\n\u00b7 **Government-backed**: [Canada's prime minister Justin \n  Trudeau supports the company](https://imgur.com/xoJ9Kze), \n  while nationalized companies like Hydro Quebec and SAQ have \n  purchase agreements in place that provide a strong foundation \n  for Lion's business\n\n\n\u00b7 **Produce their own batteries:** on top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is \n  building a facility to and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale \n  production, set to be completed in 2022\n\n\n\u00b7 **V2G technology** ready for the batteries, and implemented \n  into their school buses\n\n\n\u00b7 Deals with **BMW, ChargePoint, Nuvve, and Romeo Power**\n\n\n\u00b7 **[8 NEW vehicles](https://imgur.com/dFFTczt)** to be produced between 2021-2022 \n  including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks\n\n\u00b7 [USA expansion](https://imgur.com/wFbrle5) completed by \n  2022, will give them a **\"Made in America\"** image\n\n\n\u00b7 NKLA *obviously* had to [scrap their deal on the table with Republic Services](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/23/tech/nikola-garbage-truck- \n  canceled/index.html) to \n  provide them with up to **5000 garbage disposal trucks** just a \n  few weeks ago.

I am not ramping, I genuinely think this stock is a bargain.\n\n**DD**\n\nInternational EV manufacturers have enjoyed an incredible surge through 2020. TSLA is likely overvalued, NIO performance has slowed. There are likely to be a range of discrepancies in supporting industries where securities are undervalued. Undoubtedly, these industries will grow to meet the needs of EV manufacturers as governments set ambitious targets to halt the production of FF vehicles.\n\nRef 1: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425)\n\nRef 2: [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)\n\nAs manufacturing requirements for lithium rise (for EV li-ion batteries) demand is set to rise dramatically, and current supply is insufficient. As such, there are likely to be a range of lithium mining/exploration start-ups that will do astonishingly well in months and years to come, despite the fact lithium as a commodity has fallen in price. Moreover, as lithium is now in a dip, it is an excellent time to buy into the industry. Lithium Americas Corp &amp; others have already done well, but I'm looking to buy in far lower for a larger % return.\n\nRef 3: [https://www.ft.com/content/b9395e8c-9321-4351-b98d-a664b1e99b03?sharetype=blocked](https://www.ft.com/content/b9395e8c-9321-4351-b98d-a664b1e99b03?sharetype=blocked)\n\nRef 4: [https://twitter.com/KodalMinerals/status/1334435246872399873/photo/2](https://twitter.com/KodalMinerals/status/1334435246872399873/photo/2)\n\nI draw your attention to Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE AIM), a British firm headed by Aussie Bernard Aylward, who comes to the firm with high repute. KOD is a mining &amp; exploration company currently developing a project in Bougouni, Mali, with a whopping 350km\u00b2 of potential mining operations, expecting to haul ***1.94 million tonnes*** of lithium over 8 years, with an ***estimated 1.4bn revenue***. The company is currently sat at a **hilarious market cap of \u00a312m, trading at p0.01/share.** Cast that against the MCs of their competitors (probably 10x undervalued). The project is in large part funded by Suay Chin, an enormous player in the Chinese lithium market.\n\nSource 5: [https://kodalminerals.com/project/bougouni-lithium-project/overview-highlights/](https://kodalminerals.com/project/bougouni-lithium-project/overview-highlights/)\n\nSource 6: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg)\n\nIn my opinion, the current market valuation remains low as KOD awaits a mining permit from the Government of Mali, expected soon. I anticipate that as the permit is granted and project action begins, KOD will shoot. This is caveated by the fact the time to build the project will likely be in excess of a year, perhaps closer to two years - but the share price will hopefully grow once they gain publicity, at this point I would consider them relatively unknown.  They also hold gold mining permits in Mali and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire which will shore up the share price. Definitely worth a look at. \n\nDisclosure: I am in 295k KOD shares at p0.08.",

        "selftext": "*DISCALIMER: If you want to learn about this in more depth and want to verify my claims, this is a link of a TED conference from a seasoned enviromentalist who explains these issues in details (*[*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w)*), but for the purpose of wsb, I will keep this post nice and short and focus on what really matters: money. Also english is not my native language, so forgive any errors*\n\nIn the last few years there's been a lot of speculation around the shift to renewables. A lot of people are bullish on solar, wind an EVs and are very bearish on big oil companies. I'm going to explain to you why **the government(s) shift to \"clean energy\" and the recent oil crisis  is actually very bullish for big oil in the medium to long term**.\n\n# Renewables cannot exist without oil\n\nBasically as it turns out, **current tech for solar and wind sucks big time**, and it probably will for decades to come. Not only they are nowhere near as enviromentally sustainable as nuclear power (because they need lots of terrain,  use 20x more resources than nuclear fission power plants, and there are recycling issues), but most importantly, these green plants depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing, so **they can only run and produce energy about 30% of the time.** The key here is that there is no real efficient way (no, pumping and dumping water is not efficient) to have these plants running without coupling them with fossil fuel burning regular plants, beacuse otherwise the electric power grid would be a mess. **So the real reason that all these oil companies are fine with the government shifting to green energy is that, to run this utopia of solar panels, wind turbines, and EVs, you'll still need their oil**. In fact, these companies are the ones that are lobbying politicians (in particular democrats, in the US case), persuading it to pursue this \"green\" bullshit instead of going with real less harmful choice, which is regular old nuclear energy. \n\n# The 2020 oil price shock benefits BIG oil companies in the long run\n\nThe oil price disaster in march might cause a short term problem with oil companies, but **BIG oil companies rubbed their hands**. Maybe the small oil companies or the ones with lots of debt can face problems and go out of business, but **the GIANT with a healthy balance sheet can survive the crisis and have even more market share**. You have to think about this as if oil companies were coffee shops. During corona, many closed and never opened again becaus eof bankrupcty, so the ones that had lots of cash available before the big hit, the big players like Starbucks, will benefit when there is full or partail reopening of the economy.\n\n# Oil demand will not shrink that much\n\nIf people knew that **oil is not just used for powering engines**, they probably wouldn't have such a negative outlook on oil demand. Guys, oil is fucking used to build anything that is made out of **plastic**. Even to make some **medications** you need stuff that comes from oil. To get all the useless shit that the west buys from India and China, you'll still need oil to power **container ships** that sail the ocean. Once this corona shit is over, people will still buy plane tickets to go on vacation. Sure, maybe business trips will take a permanent hit and there be slightly less demand due to the transition to \"green\", BUT, as we said earlier, green still needs it .... and we are still not adressing the elephant in the room: there are massive **emerging markets economies** growing in the worild today, a lot of second and third world countries that will still rely on oil for their initial growth for decades. These countries will offset the loss of demand from developed nations. Shit, general commodities prices have been skyrocketing recently. You wanna jump on steel gang and not on oil gang? The only way oil prices fall from here is if OPEC shits the bed.\n\n# The play\n\nAs long as this obsession for and complete ignorance and denial on how to solve climate change continues, and as long as the goverments of the west are corrupt and cannot see that they need to boost nuclear power and public transportation instead of solar, wind and EVs, big oil companies with a heathy balance sheet will be fine in the next decade. **Many oil companies are trading at or below book value, with massive dividend yields**, it won't stay like this forever. Do yourself a favour and be long on **RDS, XOM, BP, TOT, CVX and maybe even the italian E**. Saw a lot of hedge funds buying **OXY** in the past few months for some reason. Either buy shares, and if you are a brave man use leverage. I wouldn't advise options on this one since we don't know when the catalyst for the rally will come, and one of the main points of the play is to get that juicy dividend. If you just need to use options, use LEAPS for the love of god. I expect a return of AT LEAST 20% on teh shares alone, maybe even a lot more.\n\n**TLDR: shift to solar and wind will actually benefit supermassive oil companies with healthy balance sheets that can weather the current crisis**",

        "selftext": "TLDR: I am long and bullish on AST Spacemobile (\u201cSpacemobile\u201d) which is merging with the SPAC $NPA.   The risks presented by this investment are, for me, heavily outweighed by many factors including: \n\u2022\t Two billionaires and a KKR Partner on Spacemobile\u2019s Board of Directors, indicating possible investment from private equity \n\u2022\tMassive investment from key technological partners like Vodafone, Samsung, Rakuten, AT&amp;T, American Tower, and others.\n\u2022\tDue diligence process during the transaction adding another layer of examination of Spacemobile\u2019s intellectual property, including patents \n\u2022\tExtremely conservative valuation NPA used to price the deal, allowing room for significant upside while the $10 floor minimizes pre-merger downside.  \n\nThere have been plenty of prior DD posts on NPA/Spacemobile, including [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/khpzpg/ast_spacemobile_npa_invest_in_the_mobile_space/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kn8rhg/some_deep_digging_on_npa_astscience_endtoend/).  My goal isn\u2019t to regurgitate the same information \u2013 if you want to know why Spacemobile doesn\u2019t compete with SpaceX, click the links \u2013 but to look through the preliminary [proxy](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1780312/000121390020044208/prem14a2020_newprovid.htm) filed by the company on December 23, 2020 to assess new and key information and apply that information to identified risks of investing in Spacemobile.   Here are my thoughts.\n\n\n**Key Learning #1**:  Spacemobile has a strong connection to KKR, the behemoth global investment and private equity firm.  \n\nOne of Spacemobile\u2019s post-merger Directors is Richard Sarnoff, a partner Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, otherwise known as KKR.   From his [bio](https://www.kkr.com/our-firm/leadership/richard-sarnoff):  \u201cRichard Sarnoff (New York) is Partner and Chairman of Media, Entertainment, and Education for KKR\u2019s Private Equity platform in the Americas, and serves as a member of the TMT growth equity investment committee. From 2014 through 2017, he served as Managing Director and Head of the Media and Communications industry group, leading investments in the Media, Telecom, Information Services, Digital Media and Education sectors in the US. \u201c\n\nThere\u2019s a lot there, so I want to break it down.  First, Sarnoff is a Partner at KKR, meaning that he is at the highest tiers of the firm \u2013 he\u2019s a heavyweight, not just some guy that works there.  Second, what is KKR\u2019s TMT private equity fund?  They describe it [here](https://media.kkr.com/news-details/?news_id=72baa1dc-1526-40db-a93c-b55c06b4474b) as \u201cfocused on generating strong returns for investors by investing in market-leading, high-growth companies.\u201d  Importantly, they also state that the fund \u201cseeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk.\u201d\n\nNow, we do not know whether KKR has directly invested in Spacemobile (they don\u2019t have disclosure obligations unless their ownership percentage is greater than 5%, I think) nor do we know that the TMT fund has invested.  But we do know that the person that was the head of the TMT fund for the Americas for and is still a member of the investment committee will sit on the Spacemobile board.  His presence makes it very possible that KKR has invested, though again that is not known.\n\nThere\u2019s another big reason why KKR\u2019s connection to Spacemobile matters: KKR has three very large investments in companies that provide mobile broadband.  Specifically:\n\u2022\tHivory: this is the the largest independent telecoms tower company in France and third largest European tower company.  KKR has a [49.99% stake](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181218005696/en/Altice-and-KKR-Announce-the-Creation-of-Hivory) in the company, which used its portfolio 10,000 cellular towers to \u201cpartner with all mobile operators to develop their coverage\u201d in France and \u201cseek to contribute to the development of French technology infrastructure and innovation, supporting telecom players on the eve of the \u2018New Deal\u2019 for French mobile and 5G roll out.\u201d  Basically, KKR has a huge mobile broadband investment in France/Europe.\n\u2022\tTelxius: KKR bought a 40% stake in Telxius in 2017 for 1.275 euros ($1.55 billion today).  Telxius [owns](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telefonica-m-a-kkr/telefonica-to-sell-up-to-40-percent-of-telxius-to-kkr-for-1-3-billion-euros-idUSKBN1600K8) and operates over 16,000 telecommunications towers in five countries.  , \n\u2022\tJio: Just in 2020, KKR [invested](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/kkr-invests-1-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/) $1.5 billion into a 2.32% stake in Reliance Jio Platforms, a top Indian telecom operator.   As the Techcrunch article notes, \u201cIndia has emerged as one of the biggest global battlegrounds for Silicon Valley and Chinese firms that are looking to win the nation\u2019s 1.3 billion people, most of whom remain without a smartphone and internet connection.\u201d  \n\n**Why this all matters**:  \n\u2022\tSarnoff\u2019s presence is a huge validation of the Spacemobile technology and business model.  People like Sarnoff with huge investment experience do not give their credibility to crappy, vaporware companies.  \n\u2022\tOne of the key risks I have seen discussed is that setbacks or delays could result in Spacemobile not having enough cash to fund Phase I.  KKR is a HUGE potential resource if additional financing is eventually needed.  \n\u2022\tPhase I for Spacemobile very likely includes India \u2013 see here \u2013 so KKR\u2019s presence on Spacemobile\u2019s board and investment into a massive Indian telecom means they have an already-existing connection to the incredibly large and lucrative Indian market not to mention Europe (through Hivory), and Latin America (through Telxius and Adrianan Cisneros).\n\n\n**Key Learning #2**: There are also multiple billionaires on the Spacemobile Board\n\n\n\u2022\t**Hiroshi \u201cMickey\u201d Mikitani**: he\u2019s the Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Rakuten, Inc.  He\u2019s worth about [$6 billion](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/102215/top-8-billionaires-living-japan.asp) and has a multi-billion dollar [investment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jsimms/2019/04/10/japans-richest-2019-hiroshi-mikitani-aims-to-disrupt-japans-telecom-industry-with-rakuten-mobile/?sh=3d24fe7a3a6d) into making Rakuten Mobile a dominant player in Japan.  Per the proxy, he\u2019s also going to remain a 15.5% shareholder post-merger (assuming no redemptions) and, like all insiders, has agreed to a one year lockup of his shares.\n\u2022\t**Adriana Cisneros**: CEO of the Cisneros Group, a privately-held media, entertainment, digital advertisement, and real estate.  According to Forbes, the Cisneros family is [worth](https://www.forbes.com/profile/gustavo-cisneros/?sh=79ba3283733d) over $1 billion.  Notably, the Cisneros group (led by Ms. Cisneros\u2019 father at the time) rolled out satellite television service DirecTV in Latin America in the 1990s.\n\n**Why this matters**: The presence of multiple billionaires tells me that Spacemobile has strong connections to liquidity if it\u2019s needed, and those players in turn have strong connections with financial institutions.  Spacemobile should be able to leverage those connections to raise debt (particularly in this low-interest environment) or use other means to facilitate financing if necessary.\n\n\n**Key Learning #3**: The diligence done in the transaction included a deep dive into Spacemobile\u2019s intellectual property\n\nSpacemobile believes that its 836 patent claims (as of December 1, 2020), which include proprietary and innovative satellite technologies, create a high barrier to entry and leave no competitors to Spacemobile.  The company itself has stated that it cannot publicly explain how the technology works or it would give away its competitive edge, which many potential investors (including myself) see as a significant risk.  \n\nHowever, we do know that NPA hired Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), one of the top law firms in the country, to do due diligence for the deal.  According to the proxy, that diligence included:\n\u2022\tReviewing documents in a \u201cvirtual data room\u201d including Spacemobile\u2019s intellectual property (patents)\n\u2022\tIntellectual property database searches\n\u2022\tConference calls with AST Spacemobile\u2019s management and NPA \u201cto discuss AST\u2019s patent portfolio in order to diligence AST\u2019s claims relative to AST\u2019s market competitors\u201d\n**Why this matters**:\n\u2022\tLawyers aren\u2019t scientists, but the fact that Spacemobile\u2019s patents were looked at closely by very smart people with various science degrees (as IP have lawyers) during diligence, in addition to the scientists at Vodafone/Rakuten/American Tower/Samsung NEXT, is another sign that the technology is legit\n\n\n**Key Learning #4**: The valuation used to price Spacemobile is VERY conservative\n\nBefore the deal was finalized, the NPA Board of Directors met and considered whether they should go forward with the merger.  Their entire thought process, including the benefits and risks they considered, are laid out in the proxy.  At the end of the meeting, \u201cit was the view of the Board that AST was an attractive target company and the proposed transaction contemplated a conservative valuation of AST.\u201d  Certainly a self-serving statement, but helpfully they laid out the exact comps they used to come to that conclusion for us to see.  In short, since \u201cno single company conducts business that is identical to AST,\u201d they compared Spacemobile to a bunch of different potential comparable business including:\n(i)\tsatellite (Iridium)\n(ii)\tspace tourism (Galactic)\n(iii)\ttelecom (T-Mobile, Verizon)\n(iv)\tcable (Altice, Charter Communications)\n(v)\ttowers (American Tower, Crown Castle, SBA) and \n(vi)\thigh growth SPACs (Hyliion, Lordstown, Desktop Metal and Luminar). \nThey then took the enterprise value of each of these companies and divided it by each company\u2019s projected 2021 EBITDA (or 2024/2025 EBITDA for space tourism and high-growth SPACs) to get an EBITDA multiple for each:\n\n**Company Name / Multiple**\nIridium Satellite LLC / 16.7x\nVirgin Galactic / 33.5x\nT-Mobile  8.3x \nVerizon / 7.3x\nAltice USA, Inc. / 9.8x\nCharter Communications, Inc.  / 11.8x\nAmerican Tower International, Inc.  / 21.7x\nCrown Castle International / 23.9x\nSBA Communications Corporation / 26.3x\nHyliion Holdings Corp. / 3.5x\nLordstown Motors Corp.  / 4.1x\nDesktop Metal, Inc.  / 13.3x\nLuminar Technologies, Inc.  / 24.4x\n\n\nThe deal here values Spacemobile at $1.4 billion (assuming $10/share price), meaning its projected $1.014 billion EBITDA in 2024 gives it a 1.4x multiple \u2013 substantially lower than all of these.  To me, **that is an EXTREMELY conservative valuation** and why I think this company and its share price is poised to substantially increase.  Moreover, NPA\u2019s board also noted that a 13-15x multiple, \u201cwhich NPA\u2019s management selected based on their professional experience and judgment,\u201d would give Spacemobile a value of somewhere between $7.6 and $8.8 billion.\n\n**Why this matters**:\n\u2022\tNPA\u2019s valuation at $10/share comes in drastically below every comp that was looked at by the NPA board and that exists.  If you use those multiples, NPA\u2019s share price should be $25 (Hyliion multiple) or $239 (Vergin Galactic).\n\u2022\tNPA\u2019s board considers 13-15x (and after an annual discount of 20%) to be the appropriate multiple for the industry, which would lead to a $7.6-$8.8 billion valuation.  That implies a share price of $54 to $62 (if my math is right).   \n\u2022\tPre-merger, there is a $10 floor to common shares of NPA.  So, with NPA closing today at $12.69 per share, there is a ~21% risk (assuming a fall all the way to $10, which is highly unlikely) for a return of somewhere between 2-5x.  I personally think that is a very favorable risk/reward scenario and expect the stock to climb substantially from now until the merger, expected in late February/early March.\n\nDisclosure: I am long 50k commons and 45k warrants",

        "selftext": "Gamma is a measure of risk for options, and reflects the rate of change in delta for a $1 change in the underlying asset price. In other words, gamma represents what happens to delta as the underlying asset moves. Because it represents the change in delta as the underlying price changes, Gamma can be used to determine the magnitude of movement in an options price for a corresponding movement in the underlying.  Gamma is an essential part of derivatives pricing, and is very useful when it comes to more complicated strategies of risk management. \n\nGamma is always positive for long options and negative for short options. This means all owners of options have positive gamma, regardless of being long or short the underlying asset. This also means that long option buyers benefit the most from gamma, as for every $1 movement in favor of the position, like a $1 increase for calls or a $1 decrease for puts, the opportunity for profit increases. This is because as gamma increases, so does delta, and meaning the profit per dollar increases as well. Furthermore, if the underlying asset moves against a position, like decreasing in price for calls or increasing in price for puts, gamma causes delta to decrease, causing lesser losses. \n\nAdditionally, like theta and delta, gamma varies based on an options strike price and expiration. Gamma increases as an option approaches expiration, and decreases as an option becomes deeper in or out the money. The closer the strike price is to the underlying asset price, the higher the gamma, meaning at the money options have the highest gamma. Gamma is highest when the option is at the money, and decreases as the asset price moves away from the strike price. \n\n**How is Gamma used?**\n\nGammas mainly used to analyze delta, as it shows how delta will change with different movements in the underlying asset price. This, in turn, allows for risk mitigation, as an options price can be analyzed for a variety of different situations. \n\nIn other words, by looking at  gamma, you can tell how much delta will change when the underlying asset\u2019s price changes, which allows for a rough estimate of an options price for different movements in the underlying. \n\nAdditionally, gamma can be used in more advanced methods of portfolio management. When delta hedging, gamma must be taken into account due to its impact on delta. As a quick reminder, delta hedging is a technique that minimizes delta so underlying price movement has little effect on a position. Delta neutral positions utilize this concept of delta hedging. Delta neutral positions have a delta close to 0 so underlying asset movement causes little change in the positions. This requires a neutral or near 0 gamma, which ensures the delta hedge remains effective even with more drastic price movement in the underlying asset. \n\n**An example with Gamma**\n\nLet's look at an example of gamma and its relation to delta.  If a call option has a delta of 0.25, and a gamma of 0.05, a $1 change in the underlying asset price will result in delta changing by 0.05 (which is the gamma value). As always, this is assuming no other factors change. If the underlying asset\u2019s  price increased by $1, the delta would go up to 0.30. Similarly, if the underlying asset price decreased by $1, the delta would go down to 0.20. As we discussed before, gamma is always a positive value. This can be confusing when it comes to options like long puts, so let's look at another example.  If a long put has a delta of -0.25 and a gamma of 0.05, then a $1 increase in underlying asset would cause the delta to go to -0.20, while a $1 decrease in underlying asset price would result in delta going to -0.3.\n\n**The math behind Gamma**\n\nWe know delta to be the first derivative of the option value V with respect to the underlying asset price S.\n\nAdditionally, we know that gamma represents the rate of change of delta with respect to changes in the underlying asset price. This means that gamma is the second derivative of the option value with respect to the underlying asset, and the first derivative of delta with respect to the underlying asset price. \n\n**Wider applications of Gamma**\n\nGamma helps represent the concept of convexity, which states that as the price of an underlying asset changes, the price of a derivative (like an option), does not change linearly. Instead, its change depends on the second derivative. \n\nIn mathematical terms, convexity represents the second derivative of the output price with respect to an input price, as does gamma in regard to derivative pricing. Convexity is most commonly used in reference to bond pricing and bond yields. \n\nConvexity = 1 / \\[bond price x (1+y)2\\]\u03a3\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Gamma represents the relationship between underlying asset price and delta. \n* Gamma varies depending on an options strike price and expiration, with at the money options and options closest to expiration having the highest gamma. \n* All long options have positive gamma, and all short options have negative gamma. \n* Gamma can be used to measure the magnitude of price movement for an option when the underlying asset changes, due to its relationship with delta.",

It's no longer a penny stock!\n\nAs you know, the Woman of the year Cathie Wood who called Tesla has pointed to Genome stocks \ud83e\uddec as the next tesla.

That stock has gone in 6 months almost 1000% (yes, i wrote that correctly you retards). $3-&gt; $26.\n\nNow there is a company which claims to be able to do the same genomic technology (mapping of genomes, idk too smart for me, go look it up- can break down your DNA to see the profile) more efficiently in cost and accuracy. (BIONANO GENOMICS). If you google Bionano Genomics the last few days has been gaining traction because the stock has risen from ~0.60 to 1-2 dollars and as of market close 4 dollars.

        "selftext": "Sup fellow degenerates? Are you curious about how the government is going to steal your tendies or, more likely, if all of the losses from your degenerate yolo trades can actually help you at all? Well lucky for you, Papa is here to provide a basic overview of the tax process in FAQ style. Fair warning, no DD here and there will be a *TL;DR* so you can now scroll and ignore my labor of love. *This is 100% not legal advice and is intended for general educational purposes.*\n\n***Section One: For those with tendies***\n\n**Q: What is tax?**\n\n**A:** Google it.\n\n**Q: What types of tax are associated with stonks?**\n\n**A:** While not an inclusive list, the traditional tax types you will run into will be: 1. Long Term Capital Gains (\u201cLTCG\u201d); 2. Short Term Capital Gains (\u201cSTCG\u201d); 3. Long Term Capital Loss (\u201cLTCL\u201d); 4. Short Term Capital Loss (\u201cSTCL\u201d) (*applicable to 99% of you*); and 5. Dividend tax treatment.\n\n**Q: What is the difference between long term or short term?**\n\n**A:** Gain/Loss is long term verses short term based on, you guessed it, the duration of time you owned the qualifying investment. Over twelve (12) months is long term and under twelve (12) months is short term.\n\n**Q: Is my option long term or short-term gain/loss?**\n\n**A:** You most likely trade FDs, it\u2019s short term. \\* Semi-joke, but unless you owned the option for over 12 months, *e.g.*, leaps, then it is short term.\n\n**Q: Why does long term v short term matter?**\n\n**A:** Simply put, long term gain receives more favorable tax treatment as policy rewards longer term investments. While LTCG is tax at 0-20% effective rate based on your individual income, STCG is treated as ordinary income and is taxed at whatever your effective rate is. Therefore, it is at a great advantage of someone with either large amount of gain (no one here) or high income (also no one here) to hold investments longer to receive LTCG tax treatment.\n\n**Q: How do dividends factor into this?**\n\n**A:** Depends, if your also invested into stonk occasionally certain stonk will pay out dividend payments. These dividends are either \u201cqualified\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d dividends. Without going in-depth into the corporate tax law, \u201cqualified\u201d dividends are treated at LTCG rate whereas ordinary dividends are treated as STCG = ordinary income.\n\n***Section Two: For those without tendies***\n\n**Q: I fucked up; can these losses be used for anything?**\n\n**A:** Thankfully the tax code knew people like us would inevitably try our hand at white collar gambling, and, unlike our degenerate sports betting cousins, the tax code has tax benefits for losses the first question is: do I have a net loss and, if yes, is my loss short term or long term? If you do have copious losses, good news they are deductible but there are limits.\n\n**Q: Ok, obviously I have losses\u2026 how do I deduct them?**\n\n**A:** Losses on your investments are first used to\u00a0offset capital gains\u00a0of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain. And finally, if you have more losses than total gain, you can utilize the losses deduct up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year.\n\n**Q: Bro, I yolo\u2019ed and have way more than $3,000 of losses, what now?**\n\n**A:** Luckily, or unluckily, you are allowed to carry forward the losses indefinitely utilizing $3,000 each future tax year until you\u2019ve expended the loss.\n\n**Q: What if I still have questions or need help with some other legal matter?**\n\n**A:** You should consult with a professional \\*cough cough\\*\n\n*TL;DR* **File your taxes and consult with tax professionals**. I represent taxpayers across the country before the IRS and several northeastern state tax authorities and would like to see as many of you avoid dealing with them.\n\nSource References: See Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7\u202f 1222; 1211; 1212; 316; etc. and please consult with tax and legal professionals.\n\nThe above is intended to provide generalized financial information designed to educate a broad segment of the public; it does not give personalized tax, investment, legal, or other business and professional advice. Before taking any action, you should always seek the assistance of a professional who knows your particular situation for advice on taxes, your investments, the law, or any other business and professional matters that affect you and/or your business.",

        "selftext": "WARNING: 8TH GRADE READING LEVEL REQUIRED FOR MATERIAL\n\n# Intro/Disclaimer\n\nyeah its long as fuck, but read for tendies. If its too long suck a bear dick and move on. This is real analysis of the business model, not just a bunch of emojis. It is so long because of the niche field it is operating in and how a lot of key points are not understood well by the WSB community. This company really is a diamond in the rough and a great way to play future trends with less risk as you're not picking winners. Its the \"picks and shovels\" play of electrification and renewable energies. I'll explain the realistic case for how this company is soon going to be running the best tendie mine for decades to come.\n\nThis is my second DD post on now $MP, formerly $FVAC, and i'm back to discuss the developments of the company since my pre-merger post and add some further analysis about the valuation of the company and its future. **There has been too much really shitty DD** from both bulls and bears **on this company**where very few people on here have a real understanding of this company, their business model, and the future.\n\nFirst - read my original DD post in order to have a decent understanding of the backstory cause I'm not about to type out all that shit again or explain what I've already written. Read that first then come back:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac\\_dd\\_evchina\\_tension\\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac_dd_evchina_tension_play/)\n\nThat post discusses mainly international tensions and the role REE's but this one i'll speak more on the business case of this company and how even without geopolitical tensions it is a true tendie mine.\n\nSecond - no I'm not a bag holder Ive been in since it was a pre-merged SPAC my average on my shares is about $14 and my LEAP is far far ITM and no I'm not selling any of them. Also, as i referenced in the post I work in a very similar field and interned in college at a mineral mine in the refining aspect as a chemical engineer, so while I'm not an expert at this I have more insight than the average retard and I am trying to give out tendies before the boomers take them from us. I will try my best to explain the business model of a mining company and why this company is the most unique and interesting way to get tech company level growth with the associated free cash flow while not having to be anywhere near as innovative. Ill discuss a lot of the bear arguments for this company as well and try to de-bunk them as most don't really hold water once you look into them the slightest bit.\n\n# Background of NdPr\n\nWhile the company produces as basket of Rare Earth, the plant is aiming to focus on NdPr and other permanent magnet materials in order to play the trend of EV's and electrification. These magnets are extremely important for so many technologies due to how Electric motors work. To put it simply, at current technology the only way to convert electricity to motion or the only way to convert motion to electricity relies on permanent magnets. Im not gonna try to explain more than that because I too am retarded but if you don't believe me or want to learn how watch this  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWulQ1ZSE3c):\n\nyeah i know you didn't watch that video, but just imagine you did and now believe me.\n\nHowever, because it works both ways BOTH electric motors AND electric generators rely on this technology. This is key for understanding how NdPr is the best way to play both the trends of electrification AND renewables. First, electrification is most embodied by the rise in EV's in the future, and while that is predicted to be the fastest growing segment of NdPr demand it is foolish to not to account for other evolving technologies reliant on electric motors as well. Robotics will be a huge growth market and electrification of other industries will rely on NdPr permanent magnets. The other massive growth opportunity for permanent magnets is through renewable energies. Wind energy (and possible future motion based energy harvesting tech like tidal energy) work through harvesting mechanical motion and turning a generator to create electricity. Wind power doesn't work without electric generators which don't work without magnets. In addition, wind tech is advancing down a path to require even more magnets due to improvements is Permanent Magnet Direct-Drive (PMDD) technology from the current Gearbox doubly-fed induction Generator (DFIG). Essentially what that means is the new technology will take out the gearbox currently used in wind mills and replacing them with more efficient direct driving technology allowing more mechanical motion into electricity. These new generators require stronger magnets, thus more magnetic material. Read more about that [here](https://www.goldwindamericas.com/pmdd):\n\n**TLDR**: They mine mainly permanent magnet materials that at current scientific understanding CANNOT be replaced due to their unique electromagnetic properties.\n\n**TLDR on the TLDR**: Special Rocks no replacing. Need special rocks.\n\n# $MP's expansion plans\n\nA lot of bears like to bring up the fact that $MP is still reliant on China to do their refining and they're correct... for now. Currently they mine on site and refine to REE concentrates which they then send to china to refine into Rare Earth Oxides (REO's), which then get send to become metal alloys and then finally to magnets. Currently is the only location in the world to refine past concentrate material so $MP is forced to send their material there, but that is why the went public. The intent of them going public was to raise funds in order build an on-site REO facitility, which is scheduled for completion in 2022 and is already started. They already have enough cash on hand to furnish this upgrade as they had over $500M on hand at the end of Q3, and they also are a cash flow positive company already before even moving downstream. There are EV infrastructure plays with much worse valuations and years away from breaking even on cash flow, yes I'm talking to you $QS bagholders... that tech is unproven and there are so many battery competitors in a field where there WILL be a winner\n\nWhy would they want to move downstream when they're already profitable??? Because the further downstream they go the higher margins they earn and the more tendies they can mine for us. Refining raw materials to useful materials is a value adding process and thus creates more value for the company that does it. Once they complete this expansion they plan on going to stage 3 of their business model, the ability to build magnets and other final products of REE's in America. They have not decided/disclosed their plans for this, whether it is through construction of an onsite facility, an acquisition, or a joint venture, but it is in the plans. This is expected to come online around 2025 and when the insane cash flow can begin for the company. I don't have any reason to doubt the validity of their intention as its just a continuation of the business model they are currently implementing and the majority of the corporate rhetoric is related to \"mine-to-magnet\" and \"restoring the REE supply chain to America.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for the company? as they move further and further downstream they will increase their margins from this action alone, but it gets even better. This can be shown in their in-house calculations of their 2023 adj. EBITDA target of $252M\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 7eiobfp84f961...*\n\nit is important to note that those numbers are from the current step they are taking right now in building the REO refining facility. Adding further downstream capabilities will only cause that EBITDA value to grow as margins improve, but next I'll discuss where their margins will improve from EVEN MORE.\n\n**TLDR**: downstream expansion is a way to increase margins and therefore free cash flow for the company.\n\n**TLDR of TLDR**: Special rock get more special. Get more tendies for special rock.\n\n# Business model of mining companies and why $MP has insane growth potential\n\n*\\*\\*\\*This is the most important part of this long ass post, if you read one section, then read this\\*\\**\n\nA big disconnect on a lot of DD in this sub and analysis elsewhere is the economics of how a mining company works. A mine is by definition a COMMODITY PLAY, which I know is not as exciting as a tech company, BUT it will experience tech sector growth for a period of time and then experience a period of time in which develop into a cash cow business reaping huge dividends for shareholders.\n\nWhat i mean by a commodity play is through the economics of how a mine operates. Given a mine at a fixed production volume, the costs on a year in year out basis are relatively similar. What i mean by this is the cost $MP to mine and refine into concentrate will be the same no matter the price of their product. However, the revenue they receive is dependent on the market price of their product, which is what varies the most. An easy way to describe this is through taking a look at their Q3 2020 financial results presentation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ijzcpgmc4f961...*\n\nThat value of Production cost (at the current stage of just creating REE concentrates) will realistically stay the same as that value is from the cost of labor, energy for machinery, administrative costs, etc. While these numbers will vary from quarter to quarter these are costs not predicted to experience rapid growth and this is what is important to realize. It costs roughly the same amount of money to pay someone to blast ore, dig it into dump trucks, pay operators to refine into ore, etc. Don't trust me, look into how steel companies operate, like this sub's favorite $MT. The revenue they receive is dependent on the price of REE's, which is NOT PREDICTED TO BE FLAT. Here is the historic graph of Neodymium from 2011-current:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q1ytv5ch4f961...*\n\n\\*\\*If you are an investor in $MP (which you should be) this is an important website to pay attention to because understanding the market dynamics of their product is important to understanding the valuation of this company. \\*\\*\n\nAllow me to disect that graph a little bit:\n\n1st Peak: From the aftermath of the supply shock from 2010/2011 from the Japanese Navy and Chinese fisherman story i discusses in my previous $FVAC post i linked above. China lowered exports by 40% and the price shot up drastically as industries across the world tried to gobble up as much NdPr as fast as possible in order to ensure their production lines. That was then followed by china flooding the market and selling back that backlog. that caused prices to fall off a cliff and ended up taking molyorp out of business. I'll discuss the Molycorp saga later more in depth and the differences of them and $MP.\n\n2nd Peak: This peak (late 2017) is from the Trade war trump caused with china and is another good explanation of the correlation between REE's and geopolitics i discussed in my last DD post. The middle 2019 peak is again the trade war heating up again.\n\n3rd peak: where we are now. This is from the increased tailwind of EV adoption, more from asia and Europe than the US **and** because china has been threatening to use REE's as a political tool again, which again i referenced more in my last DD post.\n\nHowever going forward if you want to predict the amount of revenue MP will earn its important to understand the market dynamic and I'd like to discuss why the price is geopolitics aside predicted to steadily increase at a very fast rate. MP, like any other commodity play, relies on the supply-demand dynamic of the sector, and REE demand growth is on track to far outstrip the supply growth. This will result increased prices per ton, but MP's costs stay the same. This is the beauty of the company, as the price goes up their margins go up too! MP and market analysts predicted over a 100% growth in NdPr magnets in the next 10 years:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img v0ta2r1l4f961...*\n\nDon't believe that metric? check this more in depth one:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 7kjnncgn4f961...*\n\nThis graph shows most important metric as it shows that the world at current rate is not scaling up to meet demand. THIS GRAPH INCLUDES CURRENT PLANNED EXPANSIONS INCLUDING INCREASED RECYCLING. What does this mean?? There is a huge mismatch in projected demand and supply and if you don't know what that will mean then ask your wife's boyfriend about supply-demand graphs from their economics class. The result will be massively increased prices of permanent magnet materials because the world will not be able to mine and refine enough to satisfy demand, so they will be able to increase their prices. BUT AS I SAID EARLIER, MP'S COSTS PER TON WILL REMAIN THE SAME. So what is the gist of this coupled with MP moving toward downstream expansion? MP's margins will increase incredibly from a double whammy of moving downstream AND supply-demand imbalance. Now what does that mean for you?? that means $MP has a very realistic and conservative path toward becoming a company with RIDICULOUS free cash flow.\n\nWhat does that mean for MP? That means that the company will be raking in cash and will be extremely flexible due to their balance sheet. They will be able to expand operations or acquire competitors in order to increase their market share and production volumes OR they will be able to transition into a boomer dividend company that will pay you tendies each year. They could do either of those very easily because the company HAS NO DEBT. In fact, $MP ended Q3 2020 with $507M CASH on hand to finance their future expansions. Okay, i know dividends are boring but the market will begin to price in that future dividend potential and give your calls many tendies along the path to pricing in their dividend power.\n\n**TLDR**: Supply demand imbalance (with geopolitical tensions as a wild card) will result in insane free cash flow in the future for this company.\n\n**TLDR of the TLDR**: People want more special rock more than can make special rock. People give you more tendies for special rocks.\n\n# Why Supply won't be able to scale up as fast\n\nA very important assumption in my analysis is the inability for supply to scale up as fast as demand and I'd like to explain this more in depth as it is the crux of this DD. This is where my experience in mineral refining is valuable as I can weigh in on this aspect. Over time there will be more suppliers that come into the business and we are seeing that already, however this is where the timetables of that come into play. Simply put supply can't go up because companies will be slowed greatly due to the time it will take to get up and running and the incredible amount of upfront capital needed before even starting up the mine. If a company is interested in getting into the field there isn't a fast path in because the companies can't just decide to go into the business and then go to the \"REE refining machinery store\" and buy the equipment and have them get set up. All the machinery in chemical manufacturing plants (REE refining counts as chemical engineering so hear me out) has a long path in order to reach the optimum design. Ill outline the gist of this here:\n\n1. Lab Scale Testing: This is laboratory scale testing in which very small batches are prepared testing different procedures and methods in order to find the optimum refining process for the goals of the operation. This is when the deciding of the catalysts, solvents, additive chemicals, etc is done in order to decide **what to do** to the ore to get the best product.\n2. Pilot Plant Design and Testing: This step in the design process is designing and building a small scale model of machinery to run the process decided upon in lab scale testing in order to determine different operating conditions, determine control points, etc. This is when different tests and procedures are determined and also a proof of concept to begin economic calculations for designing the next step.\n3. Full scale design and building: This is when the full size, real-deal machinery is designed and constructed. But again, there is not \"REE refining manufacturing store\" to get much of this machinery. Refining plants are custom designed (minus certain machinery like pumps and basic ass shit like that) and custom built. These are custom designed, custom fabricated large scale machinery designed in every aspect from material, area, volume, and depth in order to lower manufacturing costs while also allowing for 24/7 continuous operation. The 24/7 operation aspect is important because it is why the machinery is designed so meticulously. The most economic operations are ones that require little down time and little maintenance and a lot of work is put in to optimize this aspect. That means it takes even more time to produce.\n4. Permitting and Certification: Now at this point the company is years into the development of REE refining, but they still can't start operating despite the entire operation up and running. In the US, now the lovely and very fast government gets to come in. Mining and refining operations don't operate under OSHA rules and procedures, they get to operate under OSHA's much meaner, expensive, and safety prone brother, the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Government inspectors have to come in and permit and certify EVERY PIECE OF MACHINERY, inspect every single moving part and permit them, and do a shit ton of other stuff for the government to allow you to begin operations. Now due to the stimulus bill's provisions toward stimulating REE capabilities in the United states I assume that MSHA will be (or already has been) told to prioritize REE companies and they will probably be fast tracked, but even fast tracking them will take a lot of time. In addition EPA has to come in and sign off on the environmental plans of the company and probably even more government entities will have to come in to sign off on stuff that was past my exposure when I interned in the field.\n\nNow you've seen how long it would take to get up and running, but another constraint worth mentioning is who does these? Larger Chemical or mining companies (Dow, DuPont, Chemours, BASF, etc) looking to enter the field probably have their own design teams that would be able to do it in house. Smaller, non-conglomerate entities would have to hire a chemical engineering design/consulting firm to come in and do the designing, write the procedures, and train the production engineers and operators. That means there is some decent intellectual constraints as to how many people have the know-how to design at the rate needed to scale up.\n\n**Here is what is important,** any entity trying to enter the sector will have enormous upfront costs in buying the land, designing the plant, buying the machinery like excavators, dump trucks, pipelines, pay employees well before starting due to training on the machinery. Im not sure the exact amounts of money needed but it would easily be in the 100s of millions at least. Then once all that upfront capital is sourced, plant designed, people trained, etc the operation would take YEARS to get out of all that debt and achieve meaningful positive cash flow. It is only a matter of time for $MP to have significant domestic competition, but by the time these operations could begin operating $MP will be so far ahead in production and have a significantly stronger balance sheet than these companies could have. **$MP will remain years ahead of any other domestic competitors**, even though competition will come.\n\n**TLDR**: At current outlook supply growth won't match demand growth and even if more competitors pop up to compete it'll take years to start operating and even more years to match $MP's ability.\n\n**TLDR on the TLDR**: Not enough people finding special rock. More people want special rock than can get special rock. They pay more for special rock.\n\n# $MP's competitors, both domestic and international\n\nA large argument that bears like to make is that competition is coming in the US, and they are 100% correct.... but it won't matter because AGAIN this is a commodity play, not a tech company. They make magnets, their revenue will depend on the price of their product. Buyers from this are not looking at $MP like you would look at $TSLA vs. $NIO or apple vs android where you could argue one is better than the other or consumers will adopt one over the other. There isn't brand recognition, increased utility, or consumer favorites in magnets, they're fucking magnets. Think about it like another commodity, lumber. If you go to $HD to buy some wood you aren't staring at two different planks of the same type of tree and picking one because of which timber company felled it or which milling company milled it. You just buy lumber and go home because it is wood. A timber company isn't outright threatened by another timber company popping up, as long as the demand-supply dynamic in the market stays the same the first timber company is unaffected. That is why it won't matter WHEN more domestic and international competitors pop up. As long as demand outstrips supply then commodity companies will make more and more money. Now I am not trying to bullshit people so I'll discuss the international and domestic competition, but Ill explain more in depth why i don't give a shit about them.\n\nDomestic: The ticker that cannot be named due to it being banned. If you take a look at that company it is a Uranium producer that is going to re-purpose machinery onsite from uranium production to REE production and they have successfully done pilot plant level processing. However if you analyze their production numbers you'll see that the scale they plan on producing is not quite at the level $MP will. They plan on refining 15,000 tons of ore per year with an estimated 55% REE concentration, which leaves an estimated 8,250 tons of REE per year, of which 22% is NdP (all their numbers not mine), which leaves annual production of 1,815 tons/yr. These numbers are pretty good and I do own a stake in this company because I like the potential, but its scale is not quite the scale of $MP. $MP is predicting a run rate of 6,075 tons/yr of NdPr, so yes the banned ticker is a decent competitor but its only predicting to be 1/3 the size of $MP annual production volume. A downside of the banned ticker is that they still are focusing on Uranium production so its not a pure REE play, but Uranium has a pretty decent bull case for the future so i don't want to slander that ticker too much. However, again, these are commodity plays, $MP having competition, even domestic, doest really affect their business plans or bull case. Additionally, the banned ticker is sourcing its ore rom Chemours' location in GA, but getting milled in Utah, so this is a long term inefficiency to consider as well that $MP won't have to worry about once their stage 2 REO mill is complete. the banned tickers financial health is pretty decent, but its market cap is $516M at close 1/4 which is just slightly above amount of cash on hand $MP had at the end of Q3 2020, $502M. That company is more of an investment opportunity than a competitor, if its even worth investing in.\n\nOther emerging domestic competitors: [link to article explaining them all](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-rareearths-projects-factbox/factbox-rare-earths-projects-under-development-in-u-s-idUSKCN2241L6) Im not going to go deep into each one but you can see that many are slowed down to the process I explained above about how expensive and time consuming it is to reach operational status. These companies will be coming online, but won't be profitable for a while and won't be able to provide the same returns to investors for even longer.\n\nInternational competitors: Lynas Corp. This is an Australian mining company that has also received pentagon funds to improve the non-China production capacity. They trade over the counter and are a real deal competitor and also worth investing in but their growth potential isn't as clear or easy as in the US. They have pentagon funding more so out of desperation by the pentagon to get more production in the western world than loving to invest in an Australian company. In the future I would imagine a lot of this government support will go toward US based companies.\n\nInternational competitors: all the china ones. yes they produce the largest amount of material in the world and do it the cheapest but this is the result of none to very little environmental protection. Once the supply chain can go \"mine to magnet\" many companies will look to diminish their exposure to chinese companies to ensure their supply chains are not at the whims of the Chinese government. In addition, $MP is the cleanest REE mine in the world and a lot of environmentally conscious companies will want to support clean mined REE's and once domestic production is high enough there could be regulations passed to further incentivize purchasing domestically produced REE's.\n\n**All these companies were included in the forecast of supply in 2030. Even with these companies coming online $MP is still positioned for incredible returns.**\n\n**TLDR**: Yes competition is coming, but there is already competition. Its also a commodity play so its not facing replacement or redundancy like many other growth markets\n\n**TLDR on the TLDR**: Others find special rock. Your special rock still worth many tendies. You still get many tendies.\n\n# Why this is NOT molycorp 2.0\n\nThe most common point of argument against this company is that people bring up the fact that the mine $MP operates used to be run by Molycorp, which went bankrupt. However if you read into that transaction it really isn't that scary. Molycorp did go under but this was in a period of price instability and they were not running as good of an operation. Molycorp operated during the 2010-2011 peak of REE's when china restricted supply. Molycorp stock went up a ton in addition to their revenue and thus they decided to invest in milling capabilities to create REO's (I know this is $MP's plan but don't get scared yet). Because of US EPA restrictions it was wildly expensive and at bankruptcy they had $1.7B in investments into capital projects to improve their refining capability, but the subsequent REE price collapse when china \"turned the taps back on\" to the world supply caused them to not afford operation. The site then changed hands back and forth until it was [bought by $MP's current management for $40M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molycorp). They then invested in it after literally buying for less than pennies on the dollar and got it up and running more efficiently than before. Last quarter Q3 2020 they ran 3.2x the REE concentrate production volume than Molycorp ever did:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s25.q4cdn.com\\/570172628\\/files\\/doc\\_financials\\/2020\\/q3\\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/c53c5a8w4f961.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d9f65cad202807588fe516b399ca954cef08a)\n\nThey got to buy over $1.7B worth of investments for $40M and have proven they have turned those investments into operating profit. In addition, previous operations prioritized Cerium production for FCC catalysts. $MP has transitioned the goal product to be NdPr as it has much better growth potential to give it long term possibility. In addition, the market climate Molycorp operated under was not as forgiving as now. Back then there wasn't the tailwind of increasing EV adoption, or the rise of other high tech growth sector reliant on REE's. Molycorp was too early and inefficient to win in the market and didn't have anywhere close to the amount of governmental support for the industry. There is bipartisan support on all levels, i mentioned this a bit in my last DD post, but since then - and this is big and shows the scale of gov support- [THE LAST STIMULUS BILL HAD $800M IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING DOMESTIC REE PRODUCTION](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/miners-laud-800m-rare-earth-fund-in-omnibus-bill-61939620)! Molycorp didn't have anywhere close to this level of government support. And again, the pentagon invested $9M into $MP to help fund their REO mill because the pentagon views the ability to refine REO's as a matter of national security.\n\n# Discussing Concerns about Biden Presidency\n\nPeople who say this shit clearly have no idea what they are talking about. Biden (or his puppet masters but who cares money is all green) has said he supports REE mining multiple times [source](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B). His team knows their big environmental initiatives rely on REE production and that domestic production is important to keep American industry at the whims of China. Yeah Trump was more hawkish with china but lets not act like a democratic presidency is going to let china walk all over the US or that Biden and other democrats will stop their push for EV's and clean energy. REE's are a cornerstone piece to so many of Biden's plans there is no way he turns his back on this company.\n\n# Discussion of Shenghe Resources and China and their relationships with $MP\n\nThe one real concern that people have is their partnership with Shenghe Resources where Shenghe has agreed to buy all $MP concentrate through 2021 and shenghe is a stakeholder in $MP. Many view this as a negative, but i think it should be seen as a good way to ensure survival in the gap between now and the final magnet production. A big issue would be if China chose to stop importing the MP concentrate, which would give MP no customers. Since this would adversely affect Shenge it makes it less likely and also the fact that MP produces 15% of the world's REE concentrate it would hurt the supply in china, which is huge. In fact, China removed their 25% tariff on importing REE material, read this [source](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2104418-china-to-remove-import-tariff-on-us-rare-earth-ores) as it also shows how china is buying up all the concentrate they can. Japan has the capability to go from REO to NdPr magnet as well so if china ends up fucking MP, starting in 2022 when their REO site is in operation then they will be able to sell their REO to Japanese companies to bridge the gap before they have their own magnet making capability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s25.q4cdn.com\\/570172628\\/files\\/doc\\_financials\\/2020\\/q3\\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/fnvxv8415f961.png?width=2494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a5db04a13d3e1c32d0f20de57b0f291e5b841a)\n\nChina is not likely to fuck MP and stop buying their concentrate as it will hurt china's wallet and ability to produce goods while only increasing the US government support for going mine to magnet domestically. China realistically views their dominance as ending at some point now, but they know they will still be able to control the market because of their scale regardless of whether they buy MP concentrates or not.\n\nAlso, if Shenghe doesn't buy their concentrates then they forfeit their stake in MP. they wouldn't be allowed to sell them on the market, the shares would just disappear, so it would effectively be a massive stock buyback and as long as the REO mill is complete then they just sell to Japanese magnet makers.\n\n# Mine Life discussion\n\nTheir S-1 states that at current proven reserves they have about 47 years of mine life left. That can be grown from drilling and exploration of more mineable material, which they stated they plan on doing. in addition, if they for some reason don't find more mineable ore on their land and don't buy more land with ore, then they could simply refine ore from other mines as the real cost barrier isn't the digging out of the ground, it is the milling.\n\n# TLDR\n\n$MP will to the moon over the next few years.\n\nPostions: shares for virgins and LEAPs for chads.",

However, you don\u2019t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein\u2019s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I\u2019ll tell you how.\n\n\n**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [\u201cThe Path to Palantir\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more \u201cartificial\u201d than \u201cintelligent.\u201d Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human\u2019s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to qualify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computer\u2019s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. \n\n\n**Software &amp; Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**\n\n\nHeres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you haven\u2019t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesn\u2019t you stay out past 8 PM, even when she\u2019s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, he\u2019s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computer\u2019s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parent\u2019s basement, but that won\u2019t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, \u201cfour in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.\u201d](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but i\u2019d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.\n\n\nEssentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it\u2019s \u201cacquisition contract\u201d stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they don\u2019t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they haven\u2019t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. \n\n\nRemember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. I\u2019ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and don\u2019t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karp\u2019s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative. \n\n\nBest of luck and fuck \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b andrew \u201cnever right\u201d left of Citron research, morgan stanley, and credit suisse. \n\nPLTR TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nDisclamers: 100 shares @ 25 (my portfolio is around 22k.

By 2019 SpaceX had filed for 42,000 satellites but are accused of trying \u201cto drown the ITU in studies so they can go ahead and operate Starlink under FCC sharing rules while ignoring the ITU first to file rules\u201d ([https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968](https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968)) At this point I believe that funding methods were being discussed and the possibility of a Starlink spin off was proposed. \n\nFebruary 6, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell expresses this sentiment at the JP Morgan event. I think it was still only speculative and Musk would basically refute this March 9 at the Satellite 2020 conference saying he was thinking about it \u201czero\u201d. In August SpaceX reported raising $1.9 billion in private funding. This plus funding series J though M equals around $3.2 billion.([https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds](https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds)) \n\nBy the end of September Musk tweeted \"We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.\"\n\nDid something occur between March and September that changed zero to probably? Bill Ackman\u2019s SPAC Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH) IPOs July 22. A blank check company with $5-7 billion to spend, specific acquisition requirements, and marketed as \u201cthe most investor friendly SPAC in the world.\u201d Despite no announced target, there are substantial investments by Guggenheim, Baupost, Soroban, etc. ([https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional))\n\nIn October, Momentus announced it will go public through a reverse merger with Stable Road. Their partnership with SpaceX and backing by Prime Movers Lab establishes a tenuous connection between Musk and Ackman as well as aligning interests.\n\nIn December, after reports that SpaceX was seeking funding to double its valuation to $92 billion, Musk coyly responds \u201cIncorrect.\u201d The following day u/Mobiledead posts a screenshot of Bill Ackman following SpaceX on Twitter. \n\nWhen I read the PSTH=SpaceX speculation I wrote it off as being as likely as Subway or Pornhub. But when I looked into the timeline of the various threads, there were some stars that seemed to align for Starlink. Bill Ackman was offering the right amount to help complete Starlink\u2019s constellation. The $5-7 billion could fit the 10-20% minority share he intended to acquire with the SPAC depending on how much of SpaceX's valuation is derived from Starlink. Ackman would take the largest SPAC to date and bring internet connection to the entire world cementing his legacy as an investor and an activist. Musk would be able to stop funneling money from his true passion with SpaceX, the Mars mission. And most importantly even small retail investors would see astronomical returns. \n\nThe main argument against Starlink, in my opinion, is Musk\u2019s prediction of an IPO several years in the future and his tweet cautioning investors about SPACs. ([https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009)) My counterargument: He says a lot of shit on Twitter. Although Starlink does not fit every acquisition criteria, we know Ackman was in talks with AirBnB at one point and they are missing some of the acquisition criteria as well. I don't think that Starlink is the most likely candidate for PSTH but I no longer think that it is entirely impossible. This is purely speculation and I'm sure there are things I've missed. If there's something I'm misunderstanding feel free to correct me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR  PSTH = Stripe",

Musk predicts that by the end of the year, Tesla's cars will be able to navigate both surface streets and freeways, allowing them to drive between any two points without human input.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, the cars will be \"feature complete,\" in Musk's terminology, but will still need a human driver to monitor the vehicle and intervene in the case of a malfunction.

By the end of 2020, Musk expects Tesla to have thousands of Tesla vehicles providing driverless rides to people in an Uber-style taxi service.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, Musk seems to believe that once Tesla's cars become \"feature complete\" later this year, they will be 90 percent of the way to full autonomy.

        "selftext": "tl;dr: buy ACES, TAN and ICLN July calls at any strike, and/or buy shares. Dem trifecta will force these up bigly\n\nThese tickers have nothing to do with clean energy, the underlying technologies or companies and everything to do with political situation in the US.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9z54wmj9xa61.png?width=868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b05e63aae5750ba75bd9485d58ad49135f337d8\n\nIf we take a look at ICLN\u2019s historical chart, it appears to have peaked in 2008! But how is this possible, I thought clean energy was invented in 2015 you say?? You see, in June of 2008 the a barrel of [West Texas Intermediate](https://imgur.com/a/jIggkVb) (WTI) spiked up to $147 and then down to $32 in December 2008.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[WTI \\($\\/barrel, not adjusted for inflation\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b035d7440b567a06b2c5e2385c63eb7e1ccaa81b)\n\n## The Oil Crisis of 2008\n\nSomeone could do a whole write-up on that topic, but basically, oil supply and demand curves are highly inelastic. If oil supplier A is blown up in a terrorist attack or nationalized in a socialist revolution, oil supplier B can\u2019t just drill a new well immediately. That\u2019s basically what happened in 2008, due to the political situations in several different countries in a short time period, oil production was severely disrupted and with increasing demand, this caused the spot price to soar.\n\nCoincidentally, BlackRock offered ICLN to the public for the first time in June of 2008, at the peak of the oil spike at $50/share. With the spot price of oil at insane levels, talk of \u201cpeak oil\u201d in the zeitgeist, democrats talking about addressing climate change head on with a cap-and-trade bill, investors suddenly were dreaming of the post-oil future. There was a lot of interest in investing in green energy companies. Who wouldn\u2019t want to buy shares in Chevron in 1897, right?\n\nWell, unfortunately for the retards that gobbled up whatever BlackRock was peddling, June 2008 was a bad time to go long on any security, as Lehman Brothers would file for bankruptcy in September which would create a global recession and swift fall in oil prices as demand plummets during recessions. With a barrel of oil cheaper once again cheaper than a keg of bud lite, green energy stocks plummeted.\n\n# Climate Change\n\nIn case you were eating crayons in grade school,  you see, carbon emissions are heating up the planet and it\u2019s creating an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires, severe snowstorms, tropical storms and the like. Even if you don\u2019t give a shit the polar bears or Australia\u2019s tourism industry or Florida, the extreme weather events are not ideal.\n\nSo let\u2019s solve climate change then? There is a big problem though. Actually solving climate change has this unfortunate effect of reducing the viability of companies in the O&amp;G sector, which means if passed, O&amp;G workers will lose their jobs.\n\nDoubly unfortunate for the democrats, O&amp;G workers are concentrated in a bunch of swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas etc. These states have entire cities where the local economy is entirely dependent on O&amp;G companies.\n\nYour average democratic primary voter though, does not live in one of those cities. Their general attitude can be (somewhat unfairly) boiled down to \u201cwe have to do this thing that\u2019s morally important to me, and we have to make some sacrifices, and you will have to lose your job and I will keep mine, but we have to make sacrifices, or the world will LITERALLY end by 2040.\u201d\n\n# The cap-and-trade bill of 2009\n\nThere is a quite straightforward solution to climate change: cap-and-trade. The idea is that every year government will offer permits to emit X tons of CO2 and sell these to the highest bidder. These will then be tradable assets. So it\u2019s a market based system, where the price of the permits directly reduce the competitiveness of fossil fuels when zero-carbon energy is also available.\n\nSo in 2009, Obama admin with Senate democrats came out with this plan to fix climate change, known as the [\u201cCap-and-Trade Bill\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act).\n\nCap-and-Trade was immediately unpopular among Americans, republicans and blue dog democrats seized on the opportunity to shit on Obama for his job-killing tree-hugging agenda, with hilarious ads such as this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&amp;v=xIJORBRpOPM&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&amp;v=xIJORBRpOPM&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nAs you can see in the ad, Joe Manchin eventually killed the cap-and-trade bill and West Virginia\u2019s coal industry was revived (no it wasn\u2019t, because coal isn\u2019t competitive with O&amp;G anymore).\n\nFrom here on out, a rift emerged amongst democrats and republicans, because the liberal democratic party primary voters DEMAND action on climate change while the electoral college and the senate punish action on climate change. So the issue these days is more polarized than abortion (actually).\n\n# Biden\u2019s Energy plan\n\nNow, the environment &amp; healthcare were and continue to be the top issues for the democratic base, including its most active voices. Biden may have lost some of these voters in the primary, but he brought them into his coalition in the general and won the white house.\n\nBasically Biden needs to throw some ~~red meat~~ vegan burger patties at the base.\n\nNow, Green New Deal doesn\u2019t include any mention of a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, I assume, because socialists hate market-based solutions that actually work. Instead it asks for a $100T in infrastructure spending.\n\nWith Joe Manchin still in the Senate, locked &amp; loaded ready to shoot cap-and-trade again, that\u2019s not happening anyway.\n\nBut as it happens, this green infrastructure spending isn\u2019t such a bad idea. Because infrastructure spending is popular across the aisle. It creates jobs, and does not directly destroy O&amp;G jobs. As we saw this year, the treasury can just sell trillions of bonds with no downside and JPOW will happily exchange them for real dollars.\n\nAnd the end goal of Democrats is to try to use that money to get a bunch of people in the Sunbelt and Texas employed in green energy, as an electoral counterweight to everyone employed in O&amp;G.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo Biden's plan will not include a carbon tax or cap-and-trade bill, or at least won't focus on it. Instead it will involve pumping trillions into green energy infrastructure with the goal of getting Americans across the Sunbelt &amp; Texas employed in Green Energy, as an electoral counterweight to all those employed in O&amp;G. Getting people dependent on green energy in swing states is the only path forward for democrats.\n\nIn other words, Biden will order Mama Yellen to sell trillions and trillions of Treasury bonds, which JPOW will happily exchange for real dollars, which will then be used to give fat government contracts to ICLN\u2019s holdings and beyond.\n\n# How to monetize this:\n\nICLN\u2019s holdings are only 34% US based. Which is less than ideal because Biden's platform includes \"Buy American\" and one of their political goals is to employ as many Americans as possible in green energy, so I expect them to prioritize American companies when handing out contracts. Though of course, if Biden is pumping a million trillion into solar, I can't imagine South Korean solar panel producers don't also get some of that.\n\nACES (another clean energy ETF) is 80% US and 20% Canadian, and TAN (solar focused) is 50% US. ACES is lower volume though and has fewer strikes so it's up to you, I think it's getting slept on here.\n\nAdditionally, if you don't already have enough exposure to TSLA through stock, options and ARKK, QCLN is another option similar to ICLN.\n\n# Positions:\n\n50 shares each of TAN, ACES. 100 shares of ICLN\n\n5x TAN 4/16 125c\n\n5x ICLN 7/16 31c\n\n4x ACES 6/18 96c",

        "selftext": "*This does not constitute financial advice, as with all investments it is your financial responsibility to conduct your own DD and assess whether the investment aligns properly with your short-term and long-term strategies.*\n\n**CODEBASE VENTURES** \\- [https://www.codebase.ventures/](https://www.codebase.ventures/)  \n**TICKER:** CODE (CSE); BKLLF (OTCQB); C5B (FSE)  \n**PT\u2019s in CAD:** $1 (Short), $3.5 (Medium), $10 (Long)\n\n**What is Codebase Ventures?**  \nCodebase Ventures is a venture capital firm based out of Vancouver, British Columbia focused on investing in emerging markets predominantly related to the fields of technology and pharmacy. They have been operational since 2009, finding a good foothold in the blockchain, AI, cannabis and, most recently, psychedelic sectors. Their holdings which we will touch upon today are Arcology (Blockchain), Pressland (AI/News/Media), and very briefly World High Life (Cannabis) and Titan Shrooms &amp; Psychedelics Inc. (Psychedelics). There is a lot to cover with this company, but I am going to focus more predominantly on catalysts that will have them act bullishly in 2021. My overall assessment of this company is that it has been completely underwritten and is likely to be a sleeping giant that could conservatively have $50 (CAD) shares by the end of the decade.\n\nThe company\u2019s primary focus at the moment is blockchain and supporting its blockchain initiatives. This is highlighted by their recent acquisitions over the summer.\n\n**BEFORE BEGINNING** (Skip if you understand what blockchain is and know how it will be used)*Here are a handful of videos one can watch to better understand what blockchain is:*  \n**Vice: Inside the cryptocurrency revolution -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-vrdPtZVXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-vrdPtZVXc)**How does Blockchain work?** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo\\_EIwHSd4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)\n\n**HOLDINGS**\n\n**Arcology (Blockchain) -** [https://arcology.network/](https://arcology.network/)\n\nCurrently, Codebase Ventures owns 30% of Arcology, with the option to expand that to 51% ownership.\n\nArcology is a company focused on building a highly advanced blockchain network with the intention of it being utilized in both public and private sectors. The Arcology network itself is one that is highly malleable with a number of possible use cases ranging from the internet of things to social infrastructure including digital id\u2019s, wallets, and banking, to private industry, to cloud based storage and PC security. The network is being designed with real world applications in mind, and is a strong contender for adoption by governments and private corporations as blockchain becomes increasingly pervasive and essential to society\u2019s day to day lives. It is likely that in the future, most digital devices will utilize blockchain for increased security purposes amongst a number of other things.\n\nThere are several essential problems with current blockchain networks; these include expensive and slow storage, unscalable system architecture, lack of serial execution, unsophisticated consensus algorithms, inefficient network communication, weak security models and fragmented ecosystems. All of these problems make blockchain, in its current form, incredibly bulky and impractical for real life application. These systems would be incredibly expensive to implement and sustain, requiring significant computational power. They are also very slow, which is something unreasonable when we consider how many transactions (interactions that can be recorded as data) occur in a given second all across the world. Needless to say\u2026 Most blockchain networks cannot be integrated into society on a large scale due to their lack of technological capability to upscale with social demands. While on a micro-cosmic scale we can integrate current blockchain networks to fulfil small duties, we cannot implement them in a way in which something like a smart city or smart cities would be possible. To do this, we would need a network that is fast, cheap and very smart.\n\nThis is essentially what Arcology is proposing itself to be. An incredibly fast, cheap and intelligent blockchain solution. They are the world\u2019s first self-organizing, hierarchical blockchain network that is simultaneously scalable, secure and fully decentralized, which is made possible through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In past reports, Arcology has shown itself to be well on its way to surpassing a million transactions per second, which would make it the fastest blockchain network on Earth currently. Simply put, it is a blockchain network for the real world, and it is likely to come out by the end of this year. In between now and then there are a number of catalysts, which I discuss a little further in the catalyst section of this report. There is huge upside potential for this network to be adopted by governments and industries, but for now, I am going to take a step back and talk a bit about some of Arcology\u2019s unique features. The following is based on the Arcology\u2019s recently released technical paper following their first testnet which can be found here: [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/introduction.html](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/introduction.html)\n\nFive unique features of the Arcology network- Microservice architecture- Fully parallel transaction processing- Cluster computation- Multifactor consensus algorithm- Self-organization of nodes\n\n*Architecture -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/arcology-architecture](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/arcology-architecture)\n\nFrom the report, *\u201cTo achieve Arcology's design goals, it naturally demands a flexible, scalable and loosely-coupled system architecture for client software. At the core of Arcology client software is a microservice base architecture. The only way to enhance blockchain infrastructure to a level that it could support millions of transactions is through horizontal scaling. In this type of design, functional modules are individually deployed on multiple machines connected by a high-speed network.\u201d* In other words, Arcology is designed to be fast, and is working on becoming the fastest blockchain network on earth.\n\n*Parallelism -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/parallel-merkle-tree](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/parallel-merkle-tree)\n\nArcology is the first and only blockchain network to achieve full parallelism. This means that transactions can be recorded simultaneously and stacked as such in the blockchain. This increases the network's security significantly and allows for greater scaling for real-world applications such as high volume financial trading, social media communication, or real-time recording for supply chains.\n\n*Cluster computation -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/solution-overview](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/solution-overview)\n\nTo quote Arcology directly, *\u201cPerhaps most important is a node cluster\u2019s ability to process transactions in parallel. This means there\u2019s no theoretical limit on how many transactions a single node cluster can process \u2014 it\u2019s simply a matter of adding more machines.\u201d* Combine this with a decently sized crypto mining operation, and the sky's the limit. Codebase recently announced their interest in acquiring a crypto mining operation which would fit in quite well to compliment Arcology. Additionally, Arcology has been weighing the option of a potential coin offering. This would be a logical step to create a peer to peer network to assist with the computational requirements of the network. I\u2019ve attached some DD\u2019s that I\u2019ve done in the past about crypto miners, they are another very bullish sector essential for our blockchain-based future in my opinion.\n\n*Consensus -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/consensus](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/consensus)\n\nThis is a section that I believe is best explained by the report, but the simplified version is this; there has long been a trilemma in the blockchain industry between scalability, security and decentralization. For a long time blockchain networks have only been able to successfully integrate two of the three at any given time, with the successful integration of all three being practically unheard of\u2026 until now. Arcology utilizes a system known as multi-factoring consensus which allows all three of these respective areas to be addressed and flips the proof of work vs proof of stake consensus algorithms on its head. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, speed and performance, and provides a fair environment for would-be-miners of their network. Ultimately, it increases the likelihood of them surpassing their million transaction target and being widely adopted both by central powers (governments and industry) as well as by smaller developers.\n\n*Self organization* \\- [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/network-partitioning](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/network-partitioning)\n\nTaken from the report, *\u201c Arcology uses a unique partitioning algorithm called Self-Organization (SO), a transparent and intelligent process that dynamically groups accounts based on certain criteria, including historical behaviour. This is possible because most transactions are not actually processed in random patterns; over time, many users show tendencies to interact with certain other users. This provides an opportunity to optimize network configuration.*\n\n*Arcology\u2019s Self-Organization is designed precisely for this. It is:*\n\n***\u25cf Adaptive:*** *a dynamic and ever-happening process;*\n\n***\u25cf Dynamic:*** *active users are grouped into shards to reduce friction;*\n\n***\u25cf Efficient:*** *cross-partition communication is reduced to negligible levels.*\n\n*Arcology\u2019s Self-Organization is a much more intelligent network partitioning solution, it will significantly reduce cross-partition communication and overhead that comes with it. Self-organizing is the technology designed for scalability.*\u201d\n\n*Storage -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/data-storage](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/data-storage)\n\nI also want to include this bit about cloud storage which some of my IT friends pointed out to me.\n\nStorage could be a big play for them and give them a major foothold in competing against cloud storage providers such as Apple, Amazon, Google and Dropbox. Comparing them to a service like Amazon Web Services (which generates Amazon $35.08B USD annually) Arcology has the ability to truly disrupt them. This is because Arcology proposes to be cheaper, faster and smarter in terms of data storage. It also enables for greater customizability in the hands of developers, so this ensures that your data is stored the way you want it to be, ensuring the fewest number of redundancies. No doubt, this could be a huge blow to Amazon who utilizes its AWS for the purposes of deep learning. Even if Arcology steals only a billion dollars out of the cloud storage sector, this should still put CODE at a $6 CAD per share.\n\n2021 is looking to be a perfect year for Arcology and Codebase. There are several major catalysts likely to occur between now and early 2022 for these two companies. Please see the catalyst section of this report to get a better idea of what those are.\n\n**Pressland (AI/News/Media) -** [https://pressland.com/](https://pressland.com/)\n\nPressland is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Codebase, focused on the task of combating fake news. The company is working to build audience engagement tools for news media organizations while authenticating the accuracy of published news. The goal of Pressland is to reinvigorate a new era of public trust in the news and media. They have most recently partnered up with the company Showcase in order to maximize their coverage on engagement efforts.\n\nTaken from a publication:\n\n[https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/908847/codebases-pressland-subsidiary-strikes-strategic-partnership-with-digital-platform-showcase-908847.html](https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/908847/codebases-pressland-subsidiary-strikes-strategic-partnership-with-digital-platform-showcase-908847.html)\n\n\u201cPressland has now indexed and analyzed over 10 million articles, 2 million keywords and 200,000 writers, according to Codebase. Pressland's platform uses proprietary software which, with machine learning, artificial intelligence and natural language, collects and analyzes the news media\u2019s production data.\n\nWhen commercial services debut in 2020, this data will be offered as a SaaS (Software as a Service) product to social networks, search engines and news distributors in a bid to fight fake news and misinformation\u2026\u201d\n\nPressland also appears to be on the verge of becoming a blockchain-based play. This of course makes sense, as blockchain is a secure way of securely archiving news media and user data for the purposes of long-term storage in a non-tamperable way. This of course will be important for the future, and co-aligns perfectly with their ongoing blockchain initiatives. It is likely that it will take minimal effort for the company to integrate their ongoing projects into these services.\n\n**World High Life and Titan Shrooms &amp; Psychedelics (Cannabis and Psychedelics)**\n\nWorld High Life and Titan Shrooms are two investments of Codebase. I will be talking more generally about why to be bullish on the cannabis and psychedelic sectors, as I have already covered quite a lot with this report. So, treat this as the icing on the cake. The cannabis sector is poised for a bull run after Biden\u2019s inauguration. A democratic win is good for both cannabis and psychedelics as they have a friendlier legal environment which can be helpful for long term change.\n\nWorld High Life stock recently dropped however. This is likely due to the ongoing situation in the UK (Brexit, new strain of Covid, etc.) I have to do more research into this, but in the bigger picture it\u2019s a smaller holding compared to their blockchain and AI plays. Still this may leave some concerned, to which I will indicate that during the summer 2020, World High Life had record breaking sales. The macro environment is lining up though that the cannabis sector should be able to have a good boom.\n\nTitan Shrooms is a well positioned company within the psychedelic sector, which will be a massive component of the mental health market in the near future. It is projected that mental health will be a $16 trillion USD market by 2030. There have been a number of breakthrough studies in the last two decades showing the long term impact that psychedelics can have on depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction and even Alzheimers. It will be a really large market in the future, likely changing the course of medicine altogether. Recently Oregon, DC and New Jersey decriminalized or legalized the medicinal use of plant-based psychedelics. I may write up a DD for a couple of psychedelic stocks in the future.\n\n**CATALYSTS**\n\n*Recently in the News*\n\n\\- Codebase raised $5 million in private placements since December (search up their recent private placement news releases)- Announced that they are finalizing Arcology\u2019s testnet 1.0, going to be going forward with a release of a developer kit towards the end of February. They also gave a loose timeline of upcoming events for Arcology (see upcoming).- They continue to discuss the possibility of a Arcology coin offering in the Summer of 2021. It hasn\u2019t been finalized but if you look at their recent acquisitions in the Summer of 2020, all of them indicate that this is indeed a plan that they will likely be set in motion. Of course it is yet to be confirmed, but I believe we can be cautiously optimistic.- They announced that they are going to look to expand into crypto mining. This is very exciting and very unanticipated. If we look at the crypto mining sector, HUT, RIOT, MARA, DMGI, BITF, HIVE, ARBKF, etc. we can all see that these have become incredibly bullish ventures. This also provides additional support that they may provide a coin offering, as having a crypto mining operation would enable them to do so.\n\n*Upcoming*\n\nThe following is a list of catalysts for Arcology, dates still need to be confirmed, but the likelihood is that this is the roadmap for 2021 to early 2022.\n\nArcology Working Roadmap Sequence:\n\n\\- Current Phase: addressing results from Testnet 1.0, refining technical components to improve performance data- Release Software Development Kit - CONFIRMED LATE FEBRUARY- Conduct Testnet 2.0 \u2013 focus on stability, user experience and verification - unknown- Potential Coin Offering - unknown- Conduct Full Scale Testnet - unknown- Release Mainnet - unknown\n\n*Macro Environment Catalysts*\n\n\\- For the bull case on the blockchain industry and crypto please see news articles in the appendix- Psychedelics will be receiving their first ETF on January 15th. This is likely to be incredibly bullish forcompanies within the psychedelic sector, which should include CODE. While their holdings are small incomparison to their blockchain operations, they are still a part of the sector which is bullish.- Biden being elected gives a good bull case for both cannabis and psychedelics in general, as we are likely to see more progressive laws regarding the medicinal use of both cannabis and psyches than under a Republican United States.\n\n**RISKS**\n\n*Financials*\n\nThe financial situation of the company is something to take into consideration when assessing this investment. The company is currently operating at a $19 million CAD loss. This is obviously concerning, however when one looks at their company history we can see that most of these losses were incurred more recently and directly align with their recent investments, most of which have come in the form of acquisitions. This is to be expected of any relatively new venture capital firm. Most operate at a loss until their investments come to fruition. The company has been actively trying to mitigate this by conducting a number of private offer rounds. So far they have raised 5 million in these financing rounds.\n\n*Dillution*\n\nIn the past, the company has had issues with dilution. They had to conduct a reverse 10 for 1 split in June, 2020. I think that they currently have their share structure under control, however, it is something to keep in mind with their ongoing financing rounds, where private investors are receiving both common shares and warrants. I don\u2019t think that this will present an issue, especially as these private funding rounds have been increasing the cost per share month over month, but it is worth keeping in mind.\n\n*Short Term Bitcoin Bubble*\n\nAs the company is tied to the blockchain industry, they are undoubtedly tied to fluctuations within the price of bitcoin. Long term bitcoin is expected to well surpass $100k USD in value, however, in the past several weeks, we have seen an unprecedented rise in the value of bitcoin, which has many calling for a correction. I am not sure whether this is going to happen or whether it will in fact simply sidestep at some point. I have attached in the appendix a bull-case for bitcoin in terms of upcoming catalysts. That being said, as with all investments, it is important to price cost average in, as it is your fiduciary responsibility to act responsibly with your money. In the event of a dip, I am planning on buying significantly more CODE as the long term outlook is still quite bullish, and bitcoin too is very bullish in the long term.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nCodebase Ventures is a company that is positioned quite well for substantive growth in the year 2021, and the decade onwards. Their investments in blockchain, AI, cannabis, and psychedelics are all things that will pay off in the long term. Arcology is a promising venture that should have everyone excited due to the sheer number of catalysts coming our way this year. I believe that a return to former all-time highs of $3.90 CAD, is inevitable on the rise of bitcoin alone. Throw in the rest, and we could easily see $10 CAD by the end of the year. Investors will want to have a position before February, where we should begin to see stable growth to the release of Arcology\u2019s developer kit.\n\nAnyways, on a personal note. I hope that I did this company justice. It was quite a large undertaking to get this DD out to you guys, so I hope that it proves useful. I am incredibly bullish on this company and excited to see what becomes of Arcology. Please do your own DD into them as well.

        "selftext": "[SPX Monthly Chart:](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/7rPzyt3E-SPX-Monthly-Risk-Reward-Less-Favorable/)\n\n* The market basically closed the year at ATH (3pts off) and is within a hair of 3855, which is the 138.2% Fib of the March low.\n* The rising monthly channel (shown above) shows that markets are stretched near resistance and already outside of their bollinger bands. The weekly band is at 3774.\n* While I believe there is room for upside into 2021, the risk/reward is **NOT** favorable here anymore. Sentiment is stretched and a correction would be welcomed with open arms.\n* I anticipate a 10-15% correction to start the year, which would align us with the rising 200dma near 3219. We ended the year in a tight range, and there is potential to carry into 3855 based on January 15 open interest and gamma positioning.\n\nLast few days I have been selling stocks and calls aggressively in anticipation of a correction. I am long TLT calls (flat) and SPY puts (down 37%).\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\n* The AAII Sentiment Survey is quite elevated near multi-year highs and shows overly bullish sentiment.\n* The Advisors Sentiment Report reports the views of over 120 independent investment newsletters (those not affiliated with brokerage houses or mutual funds) and reports the findings as the percentage of advisors that are bullish, those bearish and those that expect a correction. The current Bull to Bear spread is one of the highest in decades, yet another indication of frothy sentiment.\n* The NAAIM Exposure Index is currently at 89 and off some 100+ prints but remains elevated to the averages.\n* The BAML Fund Manager Survey shows the three most crowded trades are:  \n\n   * Long Tech via shares\n   * Short USD\n   * Long Bitcoin Spot via Perpetual Swaps\n   * Fund managers are \"all-in\" on leverage. This is evidenced by our DIX print on Thursday yet again showing dark pool buying.\n* Consumer Confidence deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of COVID-19 \"remains a drag on confidence.\u201d\n* CEO Confidence, as tracked by the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index hit a two week low at 47. This is the sharpest drop in economic outlook since April.\n\n**Market Health:**\n\n* NYSE Cumulative Adv/Dec:  \n\n   * Actually pretty healthy right now. This is still well above all of its important moving averages and remains in an uptrend.\n* NYSE McClellan Oscillator:  \n\n   * Neutral currently.\n* NYSE Summation Index (NYSI):  \n\n   * Most commonly used by fund managers to find divergences. Above a short term 5/8 day exponential moving average is a buy signal. Below flashes a short term sell signal. This is *currently showing a sell signal.* However, sell signals in rallies tend to be early signals...\n* Moving Averages:  \n\n   * The 8/21-week EMA crossover has long been a favorite signal for momentum in individual names and also works with Indices. The 21-week EMA is important support for growth/momentum stocks. In general, you want to be long when the 8 week is above the 21 week and short when it is below with crossovers being key trend inflection signals. The 12-month moving average (MA) and monthly MACD are good longer-term risk management tools. The price action relative to the 200-week MA provides a good gauge for the health of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s secular trend. Pullbacks or corrections (aka cyclical bear markets) for the S&amp;P 500 that hold above or near the rising 200-week MA are a secular bull market pattern. Pullbacks that decisively break the 200-week MA are a sign of a secular bear market. Most corrections on the S&amp;P 500 during the 1950-1966 and 1980-2000 secular bull market held between the 100-week MA and the 200-week MA. The 2015-2016 S&amp;P 500 pullback fit this secular bull market correction pattern. The secular bear market periods from 1929-1950, 1966-1980, and 2000-2013 saw sustained periods below these long-term moving averages. This means that the 200-week MA provides a good secular bull market risk management tool or stop loss. Using this history as a guide suggests that the Ichimoku monthly cloud is a good trailing secular bull market stop loss. History also suggests that a decisive move below the monthly cloud confirms a secular bear market for US equities. *Currently we are above all moving averages and this is a bullish signal.*\n\n**Economics:**\n\n* The common theme appears to be an expectation of a synchronized global growth in 2021.\n* The optimism on 2021 delivering a record year for corporate profit growth and strong GDP growth around the globe is very contingent on a successful vaccine rollout. The current surge of cases and hospitalizations in the US and Europe is resulting in further restrictions and lockdowns that will weigh on growth expectations, or at least push out pent-up demand. Consumers have led the recovery so far with a boost from fiscal stimulus but the key to a self-sustained recovery is a strong capex cycle which is seen kicking off in Q2 2021. The labor market will also be in focus after record low unemployment the pandemic saw the number jump to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression, but has recovered rapidly though losing some momentum as it finished the year near 6.5% unemployment and consensus expectations to reach 5% by the end of 2021, still far-off from the 3.5% pre-crisis rate.\n* The recovery has already started in 2H20 in the US &amp; China while the European recovery has been more subdued. The driver of the strong 2021 recovery will be the full reopening of economies worldwide which makes a successful vaccine distribution critical. The US Dollar is closing 2020 weak and looks to have some structural issues with surging deficits, Fed\u2019s intention to boost inflation, easy financial conditions, and expected economic and political improvements. The combination of easy monetary policy, a rebound in old economy industries and a global upswing in growth provides a healthy backdrop for 2021. The balance sheets of households, corporate and governments are expanding alongside the aggressive monetary policy and signs of inflation returning causing a rotation back to value and cyclical growth supported by a steepening yield curve.\n* GDP is seeing rising 6.4% globally in 2021 according to Morgan Stanley, the consensus is for 5.4% growth. In the US those numbers are 5.9% and 3.8% respectively.\n* Inflation would be the key risk into 2021 with it likely to start showing up in 2H21, and the risk being an overshoot could start a disruptive shift in Fed policy. Surging debt remains another concern, as a share of U.S. GDP, total debt has spiked near a record high and total nonfinancial debt has surged to new all-time highs. The rapid increase in government deficits is due to the combination of 1) the budget shortfall that already existed and was growing, plus 2) the deficit spending to fund the stimulus programs to date.\n* The other clear risk in 2021 is China where debt defaults are rising and could spark a move to credit tightening and a recession that would strangle the global recovery. The overall default rate is currently low but the percentage spike in debt/GDP was the highest since 2009 which could lead to policy tightening in 2021.\n\n**Market Valuation and Fundamentals:**\n\n* The NASDAQ continue to outperform in 2020 with a 45%+ YTD return compared to the S&amp;P at +15% as major secular trends in technology continue to play out. The trend of rapid rotational moves also continue with growth often seeing selling pressure for a few days before quickly recovering and resuming the longer-term uptrends. Into 2021 earnings growth is expected to be a record though room for multiple expansion is minimal. A combination of improving economic conditions causing greater business and consumer confidence should drive strong earnings growth in 2021. Increased fiscal spending and a moderation of tariffs provide additional tailwinds. In 2020 many businesses shedded labor and transformed business models to higher productivity to offset the collapse in demand and low inventories with rebounding production point to margin expansion in 2021. The 2021 environment shapes up to be one of solid earnings growth, a return of buybacks and modest multiple contraction. The growth versus value debate is likely to continue but the low-rate environment continues to favor growth, but even more-so a greater preference for quality, companies with strong balance sheets, cash flow generation, and returns on capital should continue to outperform. We are seeing historically strong earnings revision ratios and a record percentage of stocks with dividend yields above the rate of the ten-year Treasury, both conducive to allocations to equities. Compared to bonds, equities can act as a hedge in case of inflation and, with a thorough selection process, can still offer returns closer to historical returns.\n* My forecasts for 2021 take into account consensus expectations, a bull case for a strong vaccine rollout, and a bear case for disruptions to the vaccine rollout and geopolicatical potential issues. I am assigning a 40% probability for the bull case, 40% for the base case, and 20% for the bear case to arrive at a S&amp;P fair value of 3600 though 1H21. In 2H21 we start to look to 2022 estimates and feel we can approach $200 EPS with slight multiple contraction to 22X leaving upside potential to 4400 for year-end 2021.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU](https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU)\n\n* For 2021, the bottom-up EPS estimate (which reflects an aggregation of the median EPS estimates for CY 2021 for all of the companies in the index) is $169.20. For CY 2021, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 21.7% and revenue growth of 7.7%. The 6% trend growth rate since the 1930s would point to S&amp;P 500 EPS getting back to trend levels of $187 in 2022. An optimistic vaccine scenario would see S&amp;P 2022 EPS well above $200.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3](https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3)\n\n* The low rate environment impacts the multiple, and assuming the 10-year stays low, the Fed keeps rates at zero, and credit spreads stay firm, a valuation framework would put a trailing PE at 24X and forward at 21.5X for the current environment. The spread between the S&amp;P dividend yield versus the corporate Baa bond yield is near historical highs and the ERP (Equity Risk Premium) is very high by many measures. Assuming the spread between the dividend yield and IG corporate yield goes back to 2012-19 levels, it would point to 30%- plus upside for S&amp;P 500 valuations. Assuming some rise in rates as the spread narrows more from falling equity yields would point to 20%-plus upside. In 2021, policy support should remain in place to curtail risk aversion. Besides the risk of a credit crisis, concerns over a late-cycle overheating have been pushed further out due to the pandemic-induced recession and policy makers\u2019 increased inflation tolerance. When comparing relative attractiveness across asset classes, which ultimately steers a substantial part of investment flows, equity markets continue to look quite attractive. Since the beginning of 2020, real bond yields in the USA have declined by over 100 basis points, outpacing the decline in earnings yields (inverse of the price-earnings ratio), thus supporting higher valuation multiples. Currently the difference between the earnings yield and the real bond yield as a measure for the equity risk premium (ERP) is higher than the long-term average, suggesting that equities offer an attractive excess return over bonds. Although lower interest rates support higher multiples due to the increase value of future earnings, a return to normal could push long-term interest rates higher and exert downward pressure on equity valuation multiples.\n\n[Sector Growth Rates](https://imgur.com/a/IJPIPWW)\n\n**Analyst 2021 Predictions:**\n\n* Morgan Stanley: $3900 - After a year of big swings in valuations, 2021 will be about who can deliver on earnings. 2020 was all about beta and understanding how equity markets trade in and around a recession that handed us the fattest pitch we\u2019ve seen in a decade. 2021 will be much more about stock picking (alpha) and should favor those companies that can deliver earnings growth that isn\u2019t already expected or priced. MSCO prefers companies with earnings growth most tied to re-openings and an economic recovery and also favors small caps. Financials are also preferred due to positive upside skew on rising rates and better credit; Materials and Industrials on demand rebound, earnings leverage and inflation protection; and Health Care given its GARP characteristics and re-rating potential with fading political overhangs.\n* Bank of America: $3800 - Stocks have already priced in much of the expected recovery in the economy and corporate profitability, leaving just slightly more upside heading into next year. Even as investors ride a wave of vaccine-related optimism, potential negative catalysts abound. The recovery is intact and the world likely reopens in the 2H, but a lot of optimism is priced in already on vaccine/recovery. Vaccine execution risk, delayed fiscal stimulus and longer lockdowns are risks. But a few themes support stocks: the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield is 3x the 10-year yield, and S&amp;P 500 dividends are set to increase in 2021. And unlike bond yields, earnings are nominal and participate in inflationary upside \u2013 where inflation risks may be running higher, given rampant money-printing and a potential post-vaccine spike in demand. BAML picks value stocks over growth, cyclicals over defensives and small caps over large caps, given each of these groups\u2019 likelihoods to be disproportionately boosted by a post-virus economic recovery.\n* Goldman Sachs: $4300 - A vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. The economic reopening coming alongside a vaccine, in tandem with a status quo policy environment cemented with a divided government, will help push the S&amp;P 500 to 4,300 by year-end 2021 and then to 4,600 by the end of 2022. The forecast assumes that the Senate will remain under Republican control following the Georgia run-off elections in January, the economy will continue on a path toward a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, corporate profits will rebound, Fed funds rate will hold near-zero and the yield curve will steepen while the 10-year Treasury yield climbs only modestly.\n* Deutsche Bank: $3950 - Much of 2020\u2019s run-up in the stock market came with multiples expansion, as prices escalated despite a drop in earnings, as companies dealt with fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. Next year, as the economy recovers and a vaccine allows for long-lasting re-openings, earnings growth will rebound and multiples will de-rate. The pattern of the equity market recovery, bottoming halfway through recession and recouping most of its losses before it\u2019s over, has been typical but the continued run-up means valuations are high. In our reading, elevated multiples reflect increased participation of retail investors which we see as sustaining, but we expect the multiple to begin to de-rate. For 2021, a recovery in earnings \u2014 which essentially increases the denominator of the price-earnings ratio \u2014 should lower multiples. That said, an increase in companies\u2019 payout ratios as dividends and buybacks return could at least partially offset this. A gradual correction of overvaluation argues for the current overvaluation of 5 multiple points to diminish but remain significant at 3.6 points, putting the end-2021 multiple at 20.5X.\n* Jefferies: $4200 - Improving prospects for a vaccine, easy lending conditions and broader participation among cyclical and value stocks will help propel the stock market higher in 2021. November\u2019s historic stock market rally, led by cyclical and value stocks in the energy, financials and industrials sectors, reflected broadening equity strength beyond just big tech and software shares. That rotation is anticipated to continue into next year, helping push the broader market higher. Notwithstanding the second and third Covid-19 waves permeating the world, there is a palpable feeling that the global economy is resynchronizing with the household, corporate and government balance sheets expanding simultaneously alongside aggressive monetary policy. The much-maligned value and cyclical growth sectors are slowly making a comeback as inflation pressures begin to return. This rotation has been supported by a steepening in the yield curve and with growthier stocks trading sideways. Improved visibility towards a successful coronavirus vaccine, easier lending conditions, little evidence of deflation and a sentiment switch from growth to value will lift US bank shares through 2021. Rising global capacity utilization rates, firmer producer prices, improving world trade volume, booming housing/autos and a weak dollar are the perfect environment for the S&amp;P 500 Industrials. The S&amp;P 500 materials sector is blowing off in response to a weak dollar, higher commodity prices, an upswing in global manufacturing and a restocking cycle.\n* CSFB: $4050 - Our 2021 forecasts are designed to answer a simple question: what the future will (2022) look like in the future (end of 2021). From this perspective, we are forced to de-emphasize the near-term, focusing instead on the return to a more normal world. As we look toward 2022, the virus will be a fading memory, the economy robust, but decelerating, the yield curve steeper and volatility lower, and the rotation into cyclicals largely behind us. Since the stock market discounts future events, each of these prospects for further improvement down the line should translate into a higher S&amp;P 500 as investors price in these events.\n* UBS: $4100 - The vaccine-related developments that drove stocks\u2019 gains in November and early December have now been baked into market expectations, leaving vaccine distribution the next milestone for equity investors to consider in 2021. The key driver of U.S. equities will be the pace of vaccinations, similar to how shifts in mobility drove equities through the spring and summer. As people get vaccinated, they are likely to \u2018normalize\u2019 spending on areas impacted by COVID shortly thereafter. We see the rotation toward cyclical services spending and other COVID-hit areas as a key investment theme for 2021. UBS is overweight the consumer discretionary, industrials and energy sectors given that consumption and production will likely rebound next year. It downgraded materials and financials to Neutral. It is also Underweight consumer staples, utilities and REITs and Neutral on information technology, but overweight communication services and health care on still attractive growth relative to valuations. UBS maintained an upside case for the S&amp;P 500 of 4,400, which would emerge in the case of higher-than-baseline growth against a backdrop of still-low interest rates. However, in a downside case, the S&amp;P 500 could fall to 3,300, which would entail a weaker recovery and/or tighter financial conditions.\n* BMO Capital: $4200 - Heading into 2021, stocks are poised to keep reaping the benefits of the massive infusion of monetary support from the Federal Reserve, along with an anticipated additional round of fiscal stimulus. This constructive policy environment is likely to help push equities higher even as virus concerns linger for at least the first several months of the new year. Even with recent positive vaccine and treatment developments, the global pandemic and its unprecedented impact is unlikely to fade in coming months. As such, the massive fiscal and monetary response in the U.S. and around the world (also unprecedented) will likely remain in place to combat its negative economic impact for the foreseeable future. Such environments have historically supported continued stock market gains and we see no reason why 2021 will be any different. Aside from the global financial crisis, 2020 represented the swiftest quarter-over-quarter earnings collapse for the S&amp;P 500 where index EPS plummeted nearly 50% during 1Q, thus, we anticipate that 2021 has the potential to be one of the best years ever in terms of earnings growth, something we believe will also help to push stock prices higher. We remain optimistic and expect another year of double-digit gains as the economy and society slowly transition back to normal.\n* Barclays: $4000 - Markets are right to be optimistic about the global economic outlook in 2021, with growth returning and inflation rising but staying below central bank targets. Projected global gross domestic product growth of 5.6% in 2021, rebounding from a 3.6% contraction this year, with most Western economies reaching so-called herd immunity from Covid-19 in the second and third quarters of the year. Forecasts reflected the recent slew of positive vaccine results with efficacy rates exceeding expectations, which point to a significant boost for growth in the second quarter of 2021. Barclays also suggested the inflation outlook would not indicate any unwinding of current unprecedented levels of central bank support. Labor markets are recovering, but we are still at very high unemployment, so there is undeniably a lot of slack in the system. That means that when it comes to core inflation and the underlying drivers, to wage costs etc., that was unlikely to happen in the short run, meaning even next year. It would take several years really to come back. While Barclays anticipates a gradual improvement in inflation, it will not be significant enough to cause central banks to consider tightening their accommodative monetary policy stances. We have an environment whereby growth comes back, inflation stays relatively muted, and you have central banks continuing to support the recovery, and tightening is still far out.\n* Oppenheimer: $4300 - The S&amp;P 500 is likely to post another double-digit percentage gain in 2021 as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines underpins a lasting economic recovery. This outcome is based on six key assumptions: First, that the public will expediently accept and receive COVID-19 vaccines and second, that equity investors will discount the success of the vaccines in reversing the disruptions brought on by the pandemic. Thirdly assumes that at least one of the two Senate seats in the Georgia runoff election will go to a Republican lawmaker, thereby retaining their control of the Senate and reducing (if not necessarily eliminating) the risk that the Biden administration will eradicate the corporate tax reform act of 2017. Fourth, the Federal Reserve will continue its low interest rate regime in tandem with accommodative monetary policy, and fifthly, that congressional lawmakers will step in with another round of fiscal stimulus by the first quarter of 2021 at the latest. Lastly, that investor appetite will continue to tilt toward \u201cstocks that favor diversification and both growth and value segments of the market in a relatively low interest rate environment that favors equities, real assets and other asset classes over fixed income for intermediate and longer-term objectives. The vaccine rollout is arguably the most important in determining the trajectory of the S&amp;P 500 next year. Ultimately the stock market is broadly dependent on economic growth to drive revenues and earnings across the sectors.\n* JP Morgan: $4400 - Investors are entering 2021 against a confluence of market-positive events, including improving prospects for widespread vaccinations and sustained economic reopening, gridlock in Washington and accommodative central bank policy. Given the COVID-19 crisis, vaccine distribution is likely the linchpin event. But even with widespread vaccine availability still months away, optimism over early vaccine efficacy data has already sparked a rally among stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic. The equity market is facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years. After a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing. We expect a \u2018market nirvana\u2019 scenario for equities with the melt-up continuing into 1H21, driven by earnings recovery and multiple expansion. Much of next year\u2019s stock market rise is likely to come at the beginning of the year, as lingering uncertainties over vaccine distribution, the results of the Georgia senate race and additional monetary and fiscal stimulus start to dissipate. While the broader backdrop should still remain constructive in the second half of next year, by then the market will have likely priced in close to a full recovery and investors may start to expect a gradual shift in central bank forward guidance away from the current exceptionally accommodative stance.\n* BTIG - $4000 - Global synchronized growth underpinned by central bank ease and a Washington which sees Election 2020\u2019s decidedly mixed outcomes as a catalyst for cooperation (spend, it\u2019s necessary) and centrist government (no tax hikes) results in a Redistribution of Wealth consistent with the 2003-06 synchronized reflation period where Value outperformed. Growth, Small Cap outperformed Large Cap, and International equities outperformed the S&amp;P 500.\n\n**Gold:**\n\n* [Monthly](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GLD/TUbcSBg2-GLD/)\n* Gold had a solid year in 2020 gaining more than 20% as a long base breakout that triggered in June 2019 continued to play out higher and reached its measured move objective while the rally briefly broke above 2011 highs before pulling back. If we look at Fibonacci extension targets of the 2011-2015 correction GLD has upside targets at $207 and $220. The 2018-2020 rally has Fibonacci retracement support levels at $162.5 and $152.5. Gold rallied in 2020 on economic uncertainty and a flight to safety and has pulled back in Q4 with the greater optimism for 2021 taking hold. On an allocation basis, Gold may be losing some of its luster as a store of value with the momentum seen in Bitcoin , although that has not been seen to this point with global gold ETF inflows topping a record in 2020 as a way to diversify portfolios and hedge against inflation. However, November saw the second largest outflow on record. In 2020 the lockdowns resulted in a 5% decline in global output, so the supply-side is expected to rebound in 2021. Gold prices should be supported by inflationary pressures, a deep fiscal deficit and a weaker USD. Goldman sees Gold reaching $2300 in 2021 as recovery from the coronavirus-related recession fuels higher inflation next year. Further fuel could be added from a recovery in demand from India and China.",

Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day\n\nWe also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again &amp; continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small &amp; mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil &amp; Gas companies.\n\nYesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more &amp; more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it\u2019s one of the best for long-term investing.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED\u2019s Beige Book.\n\nWhile in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it\u2019s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&amp;A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production &amp; airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it\u2019s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.\n\nWe also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell &amp; hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell &amp; hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It\u2019s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services &amp; selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It\u2019s seems a good &amp; interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.\n\nIn the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK\u2019s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren\u2019t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan &amp; others.\n\nWe also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain. \n\n \ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "I haven't invested since August, and their haven't been any dips in the market since early November. Even then, it was a small dip and the market shot up 800 points or so for the next few days. The market also seems to not be making any sense because every time the unemployment numbers are increasing the market shoots up.\n\nIt's mainly due to injections of liquidity from the fed reserve. But, at some point the house of cards has to fall. A lot of these companies that are going up are IPOs that solely went up because of niche markets that would not have been as big if the coronavirus had not have happened ex: peloton, zoom, some cloud stocks etc. Now it's hard to even find a stock under $100 because the whole market has been overflooded with newby investors, liquidity, and activist hedge funds that are trying to keep retail and manufacturing relevant that is keeping the blue chip stocks propped up as well. \n\nWith that said, at these prices is it still worth it to buy a couple shares of these overvalued firms like Zoom, Netflix, Amazon, Peloton, Tesla etc. \n\nLook for another IPO that may or may not go up? Draft Kings, Air bnb, Snowflake, beyond meat, rackspace, etc\n\nOr just wait it out logically like Buffett used to say in one of speeches be patient and only buy something if you know you can hold it for 10s. However, the more I feel I'm waiting the more I feel like I'm just letting my money sit doing nothing and I'm losing out on opportunity cost. These values just make no sense though, and every IPO that comes out sees even higher percentage gains than the one before it. The regular blue chip stocks that are steady like Microsoft, Visa, Proctor and Gamble, Walmart etc that seem like the best companies profit, revenue, and management wise don't rise up in value near as much as some poorly invested startup IPO in a niche market that has negative earnings every quarter. It just makes no sense. \n\nSo, basically is it still worth it to invest in 2021, or should we all just sit out and wait for it to drop like how much higher can it go?  \nAnd if so what makes for better investments in our current times blue chips that are less worrisome, tech companies, solar/renewables, or IPOs?",

So suffice to say I have noticed the obsession this sub has developed for PSTH and come with information on what I believe is gonna quickly become Ackman's #1 target: Plaid. \n\nWhy had Plaid never come up as a target before?\nWell, up until a couple of hours ago, Visa had an agreement to buy plaid for about $5b. The DOJ was trying to stop this merger and, low and behold, they won and the agreement was terminated. \n\nOkay cool, but why plaid?\nPlaid checks all of Ackman's boxes. Unicorn- check. Fintech- check. Huge growth- check. High barrier to entry and strong competitive position- check. Oh also, Ackman hates that he missed out on buying a piece of Visa in the past so what better way to fill that hole than with Visa's sloppy seconds?\n\nTbh, I'm too busy to write out the dozens of reasons why this is the perfect target but it's pretty obvious once one looks into Plaid and Ackman's criteria. The only reason why no articles have been written speculating such is because the merger was only terminated a couple of hours ago.

        "selftext": "#I warn you that this will be quite the long read, but one that you will hopefully thank me for.\n\n\nAnother day, another EV play. TSLA and NIO are both examples of EV companies that have capitalized on the gains resulting from being early to the party for electric cars.\n\n\nAwesome. But there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet, and that this company has a first-mover advantage on (just like NIO and TSLA did): **The medium-heavy duty vehicles.**\n\nToday, I present you with an opportunity to be early to this party featuring the sleeping giant that is:\n\n#LION ELECTRIC ($NGA)\n\nIt is currently trading under the SPAC ticker $NGA with a merger completion set for the end of Q1. \n\n**That\u2019s right, by buying 1 share of $NGA right now, you are effectively buying 1 share of Lion Electric. For anyone who wants to better understand SPACs, I highly recommend a quick search on Investopedia.** \n\nLet me preface this post by saying that [Lion Electric](https://thelionelectric.com/en) has been working on their vehicles, battery technology, and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the [largest fleet of electified school buses](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:~:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.) on the road in North America as we speak. \n\n#[Here is the link to their investor presentation where they are already forecasting a positive EBITDA by the end of 2021. Highly recommend skimming over it, but I will highlight the main points later on in the post for yall anyways.](https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf)\n\n\n\n#*So why haven't I heard about this \"Lion Electric\" company?*\n\nSimple answer: it's a Canadian company located in Quebec. No company outside of America or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits and subsidies in Quebec are great, but other than that you are right. The good thing is that it ain't gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in [Michigan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html) where it delivered the state's first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the [merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination) with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).\n\n\n\n#*So, why should I care?* \n\n\n**Because Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care.** \n\n\nNews silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on 'silently' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a slimy PR team. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). \n\n**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** \n\nAnd, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla's truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon's facilities, and most importantly they are ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. [See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.](https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8)\n\n#*And what about Joe Biden?* \n\n**Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) over the next 4 years**\n\nNO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), [where the Co-chair of Biden's Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). Their client from Twin Rivers Unified School District went as far as labelling Lion's electric buses as the **[Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses]**(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StpnGrItO4E&amp;t=45s). \n\nI\u2019m sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? [A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not compare their revenue projections to Lion's past the year 2021, as they would've admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) \n\n\n**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion's revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra's entire revenue in 2025.**\n\nAnyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be providing buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.\n\n\n\n#*Why should I be buying NOW?*\n\n**Because tomorrow may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**\n\nJim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TODAY most likely](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this it takes off. NGA is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going to pump Lion to the best of abilities on Mad Money, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. \n\n**How do I know $NGA will get pumped so hard?** The CEO of Lion featured on a [local news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I'm sure quite a few of you won't understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy will wreak havoc in the market. \n\n**Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.**\n\n\n\n#*But why should I pick Lion Electric over all the other EV stocks that get spammed in here?*\n\n\n\n**Because Lion Electric offers much more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes**\n\n\n\n\u00b7 There are currently 7 different [trucks and buses](https://imgur.com/L1cu6oS) **available for purchase**\n\n\n\u00b7 They already have **300+ vehicles on the road** today with over \n  6mil miles between them \n\n\n\u00b7 Multi-year deal agreement for **Amazon** to purchase up to \n  2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger \n  and more lucrative opportunities afterwards\n\n\n\u00b7 **CN (huge Canadian transporter)** recently Purchased 50 \n  trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later\n\n\n\u00b7 **Government-backed**: [Canada's prime minister Justin \n  Trudeau supports the company](https://imgur.com/xoJ9Kze), \n  while nationalized companies like Hydro Quebec and SAQ have \n  purchase agreements in place that provide a strong foundation \n  for Lion's business\n\n\n\u00b7 **Produce their own batteries:** on top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is \n  building a facility to and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale \n  production, set to be completed in 2022\n\n\n\u00b7 **V2G technology** ready for the batteries, and implemented \n  into their school buses\n\n\n\u00b7 Deals with **BMW, ChargePoint, Nuvve, and Romeo Power**\n\n\n\u00b7 **[8 NEW vehicles](https://imgur.com/dFFTczt)** to be produced between 2021-2022 \n  including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks\n\n\u00b7 [USA expansion](https://imgur.com/wFbrle5) completed by \n  2022, will give them a **\"Made in America\"** image\n\n\n\u00b7 NKLA *obviously* had to [scrap their deal on the table with Republic Services](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/23/tech/nikola-garbage-truck- \n  canceled/index.html) to \n  provide them with up to **5000 garbage disposal trucks** just a \n  few weeks ago.

        "selftext": "Hi Guys, \n\nSince I'm in the Canadian investor sub for the past few years and it is the closest group that would be in a similar setting (In canada, personal finance / investments) I thought I'd post this here.\n\nMy wallet was stolen from my truck last night and in it were :\n\n* 1x Company Credit Card (VISA) provided by my job for gas expenses on the company vehicle\n* 1x Personal BMO Credit Card\n* 1x Personal BMO Debit Card\n* Driver's license and healthcare card (PITA to retrieve new copies specially during COVID)\n* 100$ in cash\n\nAs a wrap-up, this morning at 5:45 AM the bank sent me an E-mail message alerting me of suspicious activity which I only saw at 9AM when I got up. Curious I logged into my bank account to find money was spent on my personal credit card AND on my debit card at two local corner stores that are within 5km of where I live. This made me automatically slip a coat on to confirm my wallet was removed from the truck and that a mess was made of other papers in the storage compartments. I had all cards confirmed cancelled and new cards posted to me.\n\nSince I don't get direct alerts for the company VISA, I called and was able to confirm 6 transactions were made also at local corner stores, some purchases were made TWICE at the same corner store on the same card. \n\nAll the purchases are between 85$ and 98$ (PAYPASS probably trying to keep the limit below 100$)\n\nI have personally called some of these corner stores to inform them that purchases were made there with stolen cards and have made an official file and declaration with the police.\n\nIt seems rather peculiar that someone can spend over 800$ at different gas stations / corner stores within an hour or so what type of purchases are most likely made? Gas? 800 Liters of gas? I'm looking to pick you guy's smart brains and see if I can help these stores and the police with any clues to look for, I especially would like these types of people to get caught and not get away with it.\n\nSince all these transactions (Total of 8) were made within stores(5-6 stores) that probably all have camera surveillance and I have most of the \"timestamps\" on the transctions + the police is involved, has anyone ever had any luck catching thieves by going through this process?\n\nWay to start 2021  ! Happy New Years to all and thanks for reading!",

        "selftext": "I see a lot of people being bullish on chinese EV companies. Almost the majority of opinions I read/hear will say \"buy buy buy\". I saw some red flags recently and I have decided to make my own research. I wanted to make a fact-based, data-backed analysis and try to predict where this thing is actually going.\n\nI found out some interesting things - TLDR: I don't agree with the strong bullish sentiment around these stocks right now.\n\nAfter quite some gains, it can be difficult to part with these stocks, but taking profits looks like the safe thing to do when it comes to these companies. In fact, all three are highly valued: XPeng trades for 2021 projected revenues of more than 15 times. NIO for 11 times 2021 revenue and Li for about 10 times 2021 sales. Additionally, for at least a couple more years, neither will have significant profits [according to analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nio/analysis?ltr=1).\n\nSeveral business, government, and market threats are also tough challenges for Chinese EV firms. Chinese state subsidies are dropping and may expire, while in China, competition for EVs is getting fierce. In addition, a recent bill passed by Congress aims to delist Chinese firms whose accounting methods are not up to U.S. requirements.\n\nThen, the recently arrived Covid vaccinations could make the process of taking the market's attention away from high growth stocks and directing it to businesses which were the most damaged by the spread of the virus only faster.\n\nI have also [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NNG1hm-9VM) about this, where I share my predictions and estimations and I add a few more red flags I have found in my research (all baked with data and facts, but I kept the video short and concise).\n\nWhat do you guys think about this? Are you feeling bullish or do you also share my sentiment?",

        "selftext": "* 76% of WSB who's still in GME collectively orgasmed yesterday as GME pushed to the stratosphere with the stock soaring as high as 90% during intraday high. Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of \"only\" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).\n\n* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).\n\n* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.\n\n* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its \"no time soon\" given economic situation.\n\n* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.\n\n* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into \"value\" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).\n\n* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is \"in control\" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.\n\n* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).\n\n* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.\n\n* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none cuz I was lazy and enjoying gains.

        "selftext": "Seems that the excitement (and concern) has subsided about the tax implications of SPACs that might be a PFIC.  I have spent the last couple weeks digging into the topic and share the conclusions that I settled upon for myself.\n\nObligatory disclaimer: I am not a CPA. I am not a (tax) lawyer. I am not any kind of financial adviser. I am an electrical engineer.  To you, I am also a random person on the internet.  This post contains my opinions on the matter - which the IRS might agree or disagree. Use this information as you might - but, I ***would recommend*** that you verify the information in your own manner.\n\nThe TL;DR summary:\n\n1. It is easy to determine if a SPAC is **not** a PFIC - look at the S-1 filing to state an US incorporation\n2. Form 8621 reporting is **not required** if you held a (potential) PFIC for less than 30 days\n3. Otherwise Form 8621 reporting **is required** \\- there are 3 methods: QEF, mark-to-market, excess distribution.\n   1. You have to fill an individual Form 8621 for *each* PFIC\n   2. Requires paper filing\n   3. These methods are listed in increasing tax burden (ie. excess distribution is the most punitive) - however more information is required to decrease the tax burden\n4. If you bought a PFIC position and completely sold this PFIC position in a single tax year (ie. held the position in 2020 only), then you still have to do a Form 8621, but it is simply an excess distribution that is taxed as ordinary gains (or losses)\n5. If you cross a tax year boundary, then you need to make a timely election (QEF or MTM) to avoid punitive taxation at the highest marginally rate plus interest.\n\nI have nearly completed a program that will fill a Form 8621 for each of my PFICs based (search the SEC reports, categorize my holding, generate the completed form).  I plan to pay someone to review my forms, but I figure if I can do the leg work of filling these forms, then (hopefully) it will cost less.\n\nI hope to fully show in detail how I came to each of these conclusions.  Again - don't take my word - verify for yourself!\n\nFirst thing that I noticed in my study.  There are several postings online that discuss PFICs and how to file.  The tax code in regards to PFIC was updated in 2018 and several of the online posts pre-date this change.  The tax code change in 2018 mostly dealt with insurance companies, so in general it didn't change the impact on PFIC SPACs - however, I had to double check the tax code prior to 2018 with the latest version.\n\nLinks to the primary sources of information:\n\n* [Tax Code Section 1.1291-1298](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1291-0)\n* [IRS instructions for Form 8621](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621)\n* [Hodgen Law Blog (Multiple) Posts on PFICs](https://hodgen.com/category/pfic-and-cfcs/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContinue if you dare .... :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. It is easy to determine if a SPAC is** not **a PFIC - look at the S-1 filing to state an US incorporation**\n\nSimple process to determine if a SPAC is not a PFIC.  Go to [SEC Report](https://sec.report/) ; find the S-1 filing and search for the location of incorporation.  If this location is in the US, then the SPAC is not a PFIC, otherwise it *possibly* will be considered a PFIC.  If you are only checking a few tickers, then going to the web site is not too timely of a process to check.  However, I had a large enough list that I create a program to check these tickers for me.  Time permitting, I can check other tickers for folks - right now I'm only working on the one that I held in 2020.\n\nNo need to repeat the things that could or could not make a non-US incorporated SPAC a PFIC - this was discussed in detail around the new year in this sub.\n\nMy plan of attack for my 2020 tax filings is to assume any non-US SPAC is a PFIC and hope to be pleasantly surprised if any are not.  I emailed the investor relations for each of my non-US SPACs to see if they thought they would be a PFIC.  It's only been 10 days, but only 2 SPACs replied back: CRHC said they will be considered a PFIC but expect to be exempt via the \"start-up exemption\".  FTOC said they will be considered a PFIC but *will not* be exempt via the \"start-up exemption\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Form 8621 reporting is** not required **if you held a (potential) PFIC for less than 30 days**\n\nAccording to paragraph (c)(7) of [Section 1298-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1298-1):\n\n    (7) Exception for certain short-term ownership of PFIC stock. A shareholder is not \n    required under section 1298(f) and these regulations to file Form 8621 (or successor\n     form) with respect to a section 1291 fund (as defined in \u00a7 1.1291-1(b)(2)(v)) for a\n     taxable year when the shareholder -\n    \n    (i) Acquires the section 1291 fund in the taxable year or the immediately preceding \n    taxable year;\n    \n    (ii) Is a shareholder of the section 1291 fund for a total of 30 days or less during\n     the period beginning 29 days before the first day of the shareholder's taxable year\n     and ending 29 days after the close of the shareholder's taxable year; and\n    \n    (iii) Is not treated as receiving an excess distribution (within the meaning of \n    section 1291(b)) with respect to the section 1291 fund, including any gain \n    recognized that is treated as an excess distribution under section 1291(a)(2) as a\n     result of the disposition of the section 1291 fund.\n\nIn particular, line (ii) says that if you had the PFIC shares for 30 days or less, then you are not required to fill a 8621 Form.  \n\nFor the 2020 tax filing purposes, if you own a PFIC for 30 days or less between December 2, 2019 through January 29, 2021, then you do not need to submit the form.  Notice that it wraps around the tax year boundaries.\n\nThis means that if you bought a SPAC in the last week of December that might be a PFIC, then you could sell the position on Monday and remove your 8621 Form requirement.\n\nThere is another benefit of this exception clause - if you take on shares of a non-US incorporated SPAC and sell within 30 days, then you will not need to fill out a 8621 Form.  (Again, I am not a tax advisor, so this is an opinion on my reading of this language)\n\nNote, this interpretation is repeated by others: [here](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/people-organisation/publications/assets/pwc-united-states-pfic-guidance-provides-new-reporting-exceptions.pdf) [here](https://www.taxesforexpats.com/articles/expat-tax-rules/requirement-to-file-informational-return-form-8621-even-if-below-filing-thresholds.html) [here](https://virtualtaxusa.com/tax-tips/requirement-to-file-informational-return-form-8621-even-if-below-filing-thresholds/) [here](https://www.taxconnections.com/taxblog/final-regulations-clarify-exceptions-to-pfic-reporting/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Otherwise Form 8621 reporting** is required **- there are 3 methods: QEF, mark-to-market, excess distribution.**\n\n1. You have to fill an individual Form 8621 for *each* PFIC\n2. Requires paper filing\n3. These methods are listed in increasing tax burden (ie. excess distribution is the most punitive) - however more information is required to decrease the tax burden\n\nThe default taxation is excess distribution ([link](https://hodgen.com/pfic-excess-distribution-rules-same-year/)).  This needs to be avoided as you will be taxed at the highest marginal rate (regardless of your true tax bracket) and you have to pay deferred interest.  \n\nThe best method to prevent an excess distribution is to make a \"timely election\" to either the QEF or mark-to-market (MTM).  Also, opening and closing your position in a single tax year can avoid the punitive taxation.\n\nA timely election means that you fill the Form 8621 by time your tax filing is due in the first year of PFIC ownership.  I will focus on a MTM as it seems the easiest. It also requires less information than doing a QEF.  \n\nDepending on your tax situation, you might want to do the QEF since it can reduce your tax burden further; however, the PFIC needs to provide correct information to you in a timely manner. Both of which might not happen and might be in error and apparently it is hard to remove the taint of filling the Form 8621 incorrectly. \n\nQuoting from ([link](https://hodgen.com/pfic-excess-distribution-rules-same-year/)) again\n\n&gt; OK. Remember that. When you sell your PFIC stock, your gain is an \u201cexcess distribution\u201d and taxed as such, until you can find a reason to have it taxed in some other way. \n\n... we are trying to find some other reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. If you bought a PFIC position and completely sold this PFIC position in a single tax year (ie. held the position in 2020 only), then you still have to do a Form 8621, but it is simply an excess distribution that is taxed as ordinary gains (or losses)**\n\nGiven that most plays on a SPAC involve a short-term holding, this will hopefully be the clause that applies to most in this sub.  The assumption is that the holding was longer than 30 days and contained within a single tax year. \n\nFrom the Form 8621 Instructions [here](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621):\n\n    Portions of an excess distribution are treated differently. The portions allocated\n     to the days in the current tax year and the shareholder's tax years in its holding\n     period before the foreign corporation qualified as a PFIC (pre-PFIC years) are \n    taxed as ordinary income. The portions allocated to the days in the shareholder's \n    tax years (other than the current tax year) in its holding period when the foreign \n    corporation was a PFIC are not included in income, but are subject to the separate \n    tax and interest charge set forth in section 1291(c).\n\nThe second sentence says that the excess distribution in the current tax year is taxed as ordinary income.\n\nBut what about the separate tax and interest in Section 1291(c) - last sentence.  Okay, go to [Section 1291](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1291).  Paragraph (c) basically says to aggregate the tax increase from 1291(a)(1) by current tax year and prior to current tax year - very circular, but the point is that if you only hold the PFIC in the current tax year, then there is not additional taxation.  Again this [link](https://hodgen.com/pfic-excess-distribution-rules-same-year/) probably describes this point better, but I wanted to go through the Tax Code to convince myself (you should too!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. If you cross a tax year boundary, then you need to make a timely election (QEF or MTM) to avoid punitive taxation at the highest marginally rate plus interest.**\n\nThis topic deals with when you hold a PFIC across tax year boundary.  I am going to assume that 2020 was the first tax year in the position (because that is the case for me).  If you crossed the 2019/2020 tax boundary and you didn't submit a Form 8621 (correctly) with your 2019 return, then you likely have a headache ahead of you.  I am also planning to do a MTM as it requires the least amount of information.\n\nYou are not able to make a MTM on all PFICs - however, for SPACs traded on a market, you can do a MTM ... so pretty much anything considered in this sub.\n\nA mark-to-market election operates as if you sold you position on Dec 31st at 11:59pm and then immediately bought the position back on Jan 1st at 12:00 am.  **It is a pretend transaction**.  Effectively you are taxed on your position gains (or losses) that occurs in the current tax year relative to your adjusted cost basis.  In position year 1 the adjusted cost basis is simply your cost basis to open the position.  After the first MTM election, the cost basis is adjusted to the share price of the \"pretend buy back\".\n\nFor example, I bought AACQ for $10.02. The end-of-year close of AACQ was $10.63.  My MTM will show that I had a $0.61/share gain in 2020 which goes into the \"other income\" line of my return.  My adjusted cost basis on AACQ is now $10.63 for 2021.  I must track this adjustment - the $0.61/share gain is called the \"unreversed inclusions\".\n\nNow two outcomes can occur in 2021 when I sell AACQ - it will be either lower than $10.63 or higher than $10.63!  \n\nIf I sell higher than $10.63, then on my 2021 tax return, I must complete another Form 8621 where my gains will be taxed as ordinary in excess of $10.63.  Again, not an excess distribution because I will perform a timely MTM election of AACQ in 2020.\n\nIf I sell lower than $10.63, then we need to look at paragraph (c)(4) of [Section 1296-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1296-1)\n\n    (4) Character of loss -\n    \n    (i) Losses not in excess of unreversed inclusions. Any mark to market loss allowed \n    as a deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and any loss on the sale or \n    other disposition of section 1296 stock, to the extent that such loss does not \n    exceed the unreversed inclusions attributable to such stock, shall be treated as an \n    ordinary loss, deductible in computing adjusted gross income.\n    \n    (ii) Losses in excess of unreversed inclusions. Any loss recognized on the sale or \n    other disposition of section 1296 stock in excess of any prior unreversed inclusions\n     will be subject to the rules generally applicable to losses provided elsewhere in\n     the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. \n\nThe loss needs to first account for the unreversed inclusions from the 2020 MTM.  Basically, if I sell below $10.63 but not less than $10.02, the unreversed inclusions will cover those losses - resulting in an ordinary loss.  ... effectively I am *reversing* the *inclusion* of the gains into my cost basis due to the pretend transaction from the 2020 MTM election.\n\nHowever, if I sell for loss under $10.02, then, first, the unreversed inclusions are wiped away ($10.63 going down to $10.02).  Then any additional losses below $10.02 is a capital loss.  The length of my holding will determine if it is short-term capital loss or long-term capital loss.\n\n [Section 1296-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1296-1) provides several examples that you can review - here is one, they are pretty good examples to help with the intuition:\n\n    Example 5. Long-term capital loss treatment of losses in excess of unreversed inclusions.\n    The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that A sells his FX stock for $900. \n    At the time of A's sale of the FX stock on December 1, 2006, A's unreversed \n    inclusions with respect to the FX stock are $200. Accordingly, the $300 loss \n    recognized by A on the disposition is treated as an ordinary loss to the extent of \n    his unreversed inclusions ($200). The amount of the loss in excess of A's unreversed\n     inclusions ($100) will be treated as a long-term capital loss because A's holding\n     period in the FC stock for non-PFIC purposes was more than one year.\n\nOne aspect that can become tricky is when several purchases and sells occur at different dates and prices.  You must provide the accounting of these lots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Open issues in my research:***\n\nOption contracts - [Section 1298(a)(4)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1298)\n\n    (4)Options\n    To the extent provided in regulations, if any person has an option to acquire stock,\n     such stock shall be considered as owned by such person. For purposes of this \n    paragraph, an option to acquire such an option, and each one of a series of such \n    options, shall be considered as an option to acquire such stock.\n\nIMHO, the statement \"an option to acquire stock\" covers warrants and long call contracts.  Short call, short put, and long put does not give you the *option to acquire*; even though assignment of a short put will give you shares.  I will likely just treat this statement as a blanket on all option contract types.  But that is simply my unqualified assessment.\n\nAnother topic that I cannot quite resolve - *what happens when the merge occurs?*  For example CCH was a non-US incorporated SPAC that became UTZ (incorporated in US).  \n\nSay I bought CCH for $11, the last market price of CCH was $18 (just making up a number) and then I sold UTZ in December for $20.  Ultimately the realized gain in 2020 is $9 - which will be taxed as ordinary income.  However, do I fill a form 8621 and MTM the gain from $11 to $18 - then my adjusted basis for selling UTZ is $18 for a gain of another $2?  OR, does the fact that CCH via UTZ is no longer PFIC?  This is the last issue that I am trying to determine.\n\n**Closing thoughts (finally!):**\n\n* I don't think we need to be afraid of PFIC-possible SPACs\n   * It is not guaranteed that a non US-SPAC is a PFIC\n* If you hold a non-US SPAC for less than 30 days, then nothing special is required\n* If you hold a non-US SPAC only in one tax year, then the Form 8621 is 'easy'\n\nIf you made it to this point, then great and thanks for reading!

        "selftext": "This SPAC has not garnered much hype after DA was announced on 30 Nov last year. Now that we are in Q1 of 2021 and approaching the merger date in roughly 2 months time, the share price has been steadily advancing. I think that the current share price of $12.6 still presents a rather good risk-return profile in the short term to enter, mainly riding on the green energy wave. I have presented 2 plays for this SPAC at the bottom of this DD.\n\nMost have downplayed this SPAC due to its high valuation of $1.6B for just being a window company (non-EV) especially in a period where commercial real estate is taking a hit due to the pandemic. But I think precisely this is a good time to invest for the long term before the next boom. We might also have overlooked certain secular trends in motion that can provide some serious tailwind for this company. Now taking a deep dive into the company:\n\n# The Product\n\n&gt;\"View is the market leader in next-generation smart windows that use artificial intelligence and machine learning which will tint the glass to optimize natural light while controlling heat and glare, effectively eliminating the need for blinds/shades in the room. The smart glass enhances mental and physical well-being for occupants, creating smart connected buildings which reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\"\n\nBasically, they are the next-era windows maker for smart buildings. Think of your standard run-of-the-mill window glass panes. If you live in a tropical climate or countries with high sunlight hours, you would know that having a window seat in the noon is extremely uncomfortable and glaring. Even if the the blinds/shades were drawn down, the air-conditioning will still have to work extra hard to maintain the same room temp. By doing so, the building's energy consumption is higher = higher green house emission.\n\n*Processing img kz6m8gsggqa61...*\n\nWhat if you had a smart dynamic glass installed which will automatically tint the windows by tracking the Sun's trajectory? Aside from the glare protection from the tinting, the temperature in the room is also effectively maintained by blocking out solar heat, so the HVAC does not have to work overtime. What if this glass panel can also act as a transparent HD display for a suite of immersive work experiences?\n\nThe building window glass market is huge, having a $120 billion TAM in North America alone, and $1.2 trillion TAM in global glass consumption. Smart buildings are perhaps the key to the future of urban planning, due to the push for green innovation in smart cities that has gained momentum and will continue to do so under Biden's administration.\n\n**ESG/Green Wave**\n\nBiden administration clean energy plan to tackle climate change resulted in the rally of green/energy stocks recently. Tailwind can be expected from the green wave for View Inc. since their dynamic glass will help buildings attain **LEED certification** to become more energy efficient with the growing requirements from regulators in US and rising importance of ESG globally. View Inc. can help buildings reduce overall energy consumption and green house emission through **20% reduction in HVAC &amp; lighting consumption, with 10% overall peak energy reduction**.\n\n# Analysis of Product\n\n**1) Suite of Services -** They are not just a smart windows maker, but essentially a tech play as well. They have launched their suite of services in 2020 to complement the Smart Glass, comprising:\n\n1. *View Net* \\- Provides bandwidth power and data network that is the backbone to an intelligent building platform\n2. *View Immersive Experience* \\- Transparent see-through HD display on the window that is fully interactive with touchscreen capabilities.\n3. *View Sense* \\- Modules that provide the ability to measure and optimise light, humidity, temperature, air quality that cater to the well-being of occupants inside the building.\n\n[Transparent HD Display with 5G Network](https://preview.redd.it/ejqf6ukreqa61.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11729adffcdff43f94f7349d4c5909bed32347e6)\n\nWhat I like about the product is that its very modular and customisable. For the basic package you can just have the dynamic smart glass installed, with just the tinting capabilities. However, the infrastructure for other capabilities is already installed after the initial set up, which customers can choose to add on different modules (e.g. sensors/displays) and customise it based on their needs. This effectively sets up for repeat businesses.\n\n**2) Longevity** \\-You may be wondering about the longevity of their smart windows, since functionality will never be given due consideration if the product is shitty and fails to withstand the weather/time/pressure. If the smart windows are treated like consumables with the need to replace/maintain every few years, it will never be scalable. You may hear it from the CEO himself on how their team initially conceptualise the product and build it around a fundamental principle in mind - longevity. Therefore, the lifespan is similar to standard window glass with over **40-50 years of lifespan**.\n\nVideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaF21GtUcg&amp;ab\\_channel=GreenBiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaF21GtUcg&amp;ab_channel=GreenBiz) (watch from 12:30 onwards)\n\n**3) Durability -** Another point about why View Inc. glass is more durable than than other dynamic smart windows is because they are using an **inorganic ceramic material** as the nano-coating layer instead of organic material, which is the current industry norm. Even though organic material is cheaper to engineer, resulting in a cheaper product for their end clients, but the coating will be degraded by the heat from the sun which will make it less durable over time.\n\n**4) Market share** \\- Currently, they are leading the market with over 80% market share. In terms of economic moat, they have over **1k patents** (600+ currently, 300+ filed). This is a proprietary tech and after 12 years of R&amp;D, I think that they will be able to fairly sustain a huge competitive advantage over many other competitors, and effectively creating a high barrier to entry for new entrants due to the sheer amount of patents they possess.\n\n**5) Pricing &amp; Revenue** \\- Current revenue as of 2020 stands at around $31m with over $560m in  backlog orders (LOI signed). Although their dynamic window glasses cost upward of 50% more than standard window glasses, I think it's a highly differentiated product in which building owners can eventually charge a premium on rental leases = resulting in higher leasing revenues for them. One success case story is Civica Cherry Creek, an office building in Denver has managed to achieve the highest weighted average rental rates out of any office buildings in Denver city after switching to View's glass.\n\nOf course, I anticipate a huge inertia in the beginning where the mass market will put up resistance to adopt this product. However, overtime, combining the economies of scale in their factories to bring down production costs (higher gross margins) and rising demand globally arising from a proven track record, I can foresee exponential growth for this company in the long term. They are expecting revenue growths to be around 127% CAGR over the next 5 years, which I personally think it's possible but the exponential growth will not happen till 2023 onwards, since they need the initial two years for market entry into more markets/sectors.\n\n6) **Investors** \\- Early prominent VC funding include Corning and Softbank. However, I wish to point out that in recent SEC filings, **GIC Investment** (*Singapore state-owned sovereign fund, owned by the Government of Singapore*) initiated a 10% stake of $50 million in CFII last week, and an additional $200m PIPE investment today. Let me tell you why I'm so bullish about this. Singapore is a highly developed and urbanised country located in South-east Asia with a myriad of high-rise buildings/skyscrapers, tropical climate with plenty of sun activity all year round. Although N.A market is huge, but usually buildings in states with most sunlight activity e.g. California/Arizona will constitute the main bulk of customers. Let's imagine if the product is able to break into the Asia market, or even into South-east Asia with tropical climate zones, the revenues would be insane. GIC obviously conducted their DD as they won't screw around with state-owned money. They know the growth potential of this proprietary tech once this hits the market big time, and perhaps even a business arrangement to bring this product into Singapore? Other players will likely not stand a chance, with the exception of China.\n\n7) **Ability to scale**:\n\n* Current projects are only in the commercial space which has taken a huge hit due to the pandemic. With the ongoing trend in WFH, the residential market is essentially a cash cow for milking, especially against the backdrop of demand for healthy home working environment. In light of this, the CEO said in an interview that he has **already completed 50 residential projects** (this wasn't published as it's still in the works) and he is developing a product for residential market **this year** to target contemporary homes. LINK: [https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/view](https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/view) (from 10:45 onwards). The convergence of WFH trend and smart homes will definitely be a huge play, even more so than commercial. Does it reminds you of Netflix's Black Mirror? Transparent displays are certainly a sight to behold.\n\n*Processing img 908m94rkeqa61...*\n\n* Given the ubiquitous applications with glass, possibilities are not limited to just smart buildings. In fact, one really strong partnership with great potential would be to license the proprietary tech to EV car makers. **Incredible synergy can be found in the future of electric vehicle glass display**, where car window panels can function as a smart display with vehicle integration + auto tinting capabilities. In fact, the **entire transportation industry** could be disrupted by this tech, think of your Buses/Rails/Subway/Cruises and how smart glass display could reinvent the future of Advertisements in commercial transportation, and how fast would they jump on this bandwagon if they are able to monetise this new piece of glass.\n* Other uses across different sectors include the **hospitality industry** (airports, hotels, resorts) and **healthcare sector**, like hospital wards windows.\n\nFYI, they have piloted their product in 3 different US airports, namely SFO, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Boston airports.  After retrofitting their Smart Glass in the airports, results were rather stellar with an actual increase in concessionary sales, energy cost savings, as well as longer dwell time in such areas.\n\nCase study for DFO airport: [https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/dfw-airport-dynamic-glass-pilot-research-study\\_0.pdf](https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/dfw-airport-dynamic-glass-pilot-research-study_0.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear Case/Downsides**\n\n* Glassdoor rating of company seems poor with management woes at the executive level, and there were reports of View Inc laying off their staff sometime in April 2020. I think that internal turmoil would be detrimental and could impede their growth in the future.\n* Current earnings of $31m in 2020 does not really justify the valuation of $1.6b (much speculation is on future growth potential).\n* They have a current minimum order of $1M, which will not sit well with smaller commercial buildings or residential market. This will result in them losing market share gradually to their smaller competitors who can cater to such clientele.\n* The biggest risk to their Intellectual Property is that it is not universal i.e. it does not have an international protection. Patents are territory rights, so even though their tech is protected in US, I expect proliferation of copy cats in other countries like \\*coughs\\* China. They may register for IP in China as well, but let's face it, its not exactly fool-proof and Chinese companies operate differently in China. Although there will be imitations, but I believe that View's level of R&amp;D is extremely strong after 12 years in operation. Other copy-cat Smart Glass companies would unlikely be able to achieve the same level of product as View, thus ensuring levels of product differentiation.\n\n**The Play**\n\nWith the merger expected to complete by Q1 of 2021 (2 months time), I expect CFII to pop closer to merger date based on the lifecycle of SPAC companies, perhaps in the $14-$15 range. But once it reaches ATH right before merger, it will probably be a good time to sell, as once post-merger happens and downside cap is removed, it will most likely fall below $10 or even lower as the industry is very CAPEX- intensive. In addition, I think that the commercial space is likely to remain sluggish in the near term, which will push the price further down. It will also likely burn more cash in the process, since you have to bear in mind that any new futuristic tech adoption is an extremely long and arduous process.\n\nRevolutionary tech like iPhones/Tesla did not pick up from the get-go after it was introduced to the market, and it took several years before they saw some real results. This is probably a good time to accumulate your positions while its being massively hated on, and believe in the conviction that 1) they are the market leader with a wide economic moat, &gt;1k patents and ability to scale up while bringing down costs. 2) secular ESG trend with Biden's green plan will provide good tailwind for the sector at least for the next 4+ years, in which their policies will likely benefit the industry. 3) multiple uses applications are HUGE with amazing potential for licensing/partnership plays in EV/hospitality/healthcare sectors. I have strong conviction in the long term that it is going to be a multi-bagger if you keep accumulating the dips post-merger.\n\n**TLDR**: In short, buy now for the pre-merger pop and sell right before merger. Following a post-merger sell-off, accumulate on the dip and ride on for the long term in the next few years.\n\n*Positions: Warrants @ $2.4*\n\nLink to investor presentation: [https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/View-Investor-Presentation-High.pdf](https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/View-Investor-Presentation-High.pdf)",

        "selftext": "I'm no investing expert, but I listened to those who are and here are some conclusions (please correct me where I'm wrong).\n\n- With current frothy market valuations we have less expected future returns from the market. That's just maths. (The higher the asset is valued, the less future return you can expect from it)\n\n- In recent interview **Charlie Munger** says next decade we will be getting **lower returns**. **Ray Dalio** shared similar view.\n\n- If **hyperinflation** happens (unlikely, but some conspiracy theorists do claim it can be the case) stocks might rise against USD, but purchasing power will fall, so stock investors will still be left behind.\n\n- Investing in speculative SPACS, TSLA valuations, TikTok/Youtube investing channels, Robbinghood WSB gamblers, margin traders: all symptoms of an ecstatic market. Could go on for a few years still, but overall these are signs or overheated market.\n\nLost decades have happened before and surely will happen again and time is about right. (What would magically make this time different?) \n\nBut how do we **PROTECT** ourselves against this and even **THRIVE** during a lost decade?\n\nI assume we have no ability to time the market (good for you if you have).\n\nOne conclusion is **DIVERSIFICATION**.\n\nBut apart from a **diversified total world stock index**, where can we put our money?\n\n- **Bonds?** The yields are low and if yields are increased bond indices will fall.\n\n- **Real estate?** Yes, real estate will indeed keep up with inflation, but it is not that easy to purchase for average investor, not liquid and also has risks like increased taxes, amortisation, upkeep, geopolitical risk for people living in potential warzones, etc...\n\n- **Gold?** Not an income producing asset. Maybe 5% of portfolio?\n\n- **Bitcoin.** Also not an income producing asset, but makes more sense than gold. But again, normally you would invest 5% MAX in something so speculative.\n\n- **Cash?** Will be eaten up by inflation. Pretty much losing money by doing nothing.\n\n- **Value stocks?** Probably the answer, since historically statistically value stocks have returned more than growth stocks (yes it sounds like a paradox, but statistics prove it). Relevant video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt_CvL3k\n\n- Here is **THE PROBLEM** if you want to invest in value stocks. You have to have ability to pick them. But why go through all the learning if you can just outsource it to Warren Buffett and buy Berkshire Hathaway?\n\nOne reason might be that you have **advantage** over Berkshire Hathaway by being able to pick value stocks in **smaller market cap markets** which are inaccessible to BRK due to their size.\n\nProblem is  - due to **information abundance** value investing strategies are **public information** and therefore already **priced in** at least partially. As a value investor in 2020 you have less chances of outperforming the market compared to value investor in 1950s. Any dude in slums of India can watch Sven Carlin, read intelligent investor and decide to become a value investor, so there are serious doubts that average, common investor from reddit will be able to outperform.\n\nThere are a few more reasons to consider Berkshire: by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger passing away in next decade most people assume Berkshire will suffer, but in fact, I think the **OPPOSITE** will happen: **Berkshire will PUMP**.\n\nBecause markets do **the opposite** of what normies think will happen.\n\nWarren Buffett dies -&gt; Berkshire repurchase their stock -&gt; normies realise that the Berkshire can function very well without WB and that his knowledge has been fully passed on to those in charge -&gt; normies rush into Berkshire. Berkshire outperforms S&amp;P during next decade.\n\nRealistic or stupid?\n\n**TL:DR version:** Value stocks historically return more than growth stocks and since lately value has been lagging behind and since we are bad stock pickers, shouldn't we just buy Berkshire Hathaway?\n\nWhat am I missing? What other options do normal investors have? I'm not talking about billionaires who can buy sports teams and so on, but normal people on reddit.",

        "selftext": "Sup Folks, Fred here with another post on spacs. Seen we have a lot of new members in this community, it's time to in depth explain, what a spac is, and why companies are using spacs to go public ( en mass ) these days.\n\nFor a more in depth analysis with examples check out my video on this topic :\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR0JIu9vWFtA5l2Y3jZe4GPCo3id0S5s99xWLquDQXCWzC86UxdXwZEcjU4&amp;v=OaW1FMhIL24&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR0JIu9vWFtA5l2Y3jZe4GPCo3id0S5s99xWLquDQXCWzC86UxdXwZEcjU4&amp;v=OaW1FMhIL24&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nIn Summary :\n\nCatalyst Number one : Virus Strikes in Feb 2020. very bad time to be alive as a growing company right. --&gt; private investors don't want to invest in new opportunities, they want to preserve current portfolio's = only logic. so March/ april 2020, the private market dried up. No money there for companies. **Alternative : going public**\n\nWays to go public:\n\n*( note here : In my opinion, the more options, a company has, the better market we will have, as companies can make an educated decision on how to go public. They can chose the way of going public that would benefit them the most )*\n\n**1) Standard IPO--&gt;**lengthy process 18 months + high cost basis )\n\n**2) Direct listing--&gt;** lengthy process 18 months + company evaluates themselves + low cost basis)\n\n**3) Spac --&gt;** Fast process ( 4-6 months on average + accurate valuations + high cost basis )\n\n**4) reverse merger** ( we will leave this as is , as it's not a frequently used mechanism )\n\n**Why are we seeing more spacs on the market, and why are more and more comapnies choosing spacs to go public?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**General spac construction :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jk42lovm70b61.png?width=1574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47a3e13945b46b5e3b05064a52c8d94a16e56a5c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sponsors advantages ( pipe &amp; spac )**\n\nSimple :\n\n* The people setting up these spacs \" the sponsors \", make millions of dollars of a company going public through their spac, regardless of the company doing well afterwards ( despac timeframe )\n* More and more quality companies, are choosing spacs to go public, due to covid cash flow issues. It's a neccesity for them to survive, these investor are jumping on them, because they see the potential.\n* Unlike a traditional ipo process, the sponsors can set up meetings with the boards of these companies and educate themselves on the exact value this company offers and what their future plans include. **Companies can pitch their forward projections and investors can look into and evaluate them= key**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Company going public through a spac advantages**\n\nSimple:\n\n* Like mentioned earlier : fast process with correct valuations.\n* These meetings with spac boards, are also beneficial for them. --&gt; they can see who is running the spac ( **MANAGEMENT OF A SPAC IS KEY**), what is the history and field of expertise of the guys running the spac, are they well connected in the sector, can they possibly guide us ,to what we, as a company want to achieve in the future.                                                                                                       *note --&gt; most of the time 1 or 2 guys of the spac board will come onto the board of the new company to guide them futurewise. So the target company wants to have top notch guys in a specific industry on their board.*\n* They get a lot of cash both from the spac as from the pipe ( see picture above ), result is always a de-spaced company with a lot of cash on the balance = key for future growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion : Since March/ April 2020, more and more companies are choosing the spac way as it saves them from a lenghty and costly ipo process. More and more investors are willing to put in money into spacs, as they see quality companies choosing for spacs as the way to go public. Spacs will remain popular in the years following, the only thing that can stop us from making money is bad companies going public through a spac ( For example, Jeffrey's hotdog stand, valuated at 1.5 billion ) , the sec will in turn try to intervene and regulate this market, so let's hope we avoid the nikolas of this world and make more bank.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Markets face a big week of news, with stimulus at the top of the list  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/markets-face-a-big-week-of-news-with-stimulus-at-the-top-of-the-list.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets will stay laser-focused on the prospect for more fiscal stimulus in the busy week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Politics and politicians are likely to continue dominating the headlines, as Democrats seek President Donald Trump\u2019s removal after a mob of his followers took over the Capitol Building on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; But it is stimulus that should get the most attention from investors, who are betting the new Democratic majority in Congress will move quickly and that it could consider a package of $1 trillion or more.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose to record highs in the past week, boosted in large part by the idea of a bigger stimulus package.\n*****\n&gt; With Democrats now in control of the Senate and House, the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden is expected to deliver an even bigger stimulus package than had been expected with a divided Congress. Biden said Friday the total will be in \u201cthe trillions of dollars.\u201d The election Tuesday of two Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, shifted control of the Senate to Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; While disturbing, the temporary assault on the Capitol Building did not ruffle markets, and the removal of Trump is not expected to receive enough Republican support to succeed with just days remaining in his term. Biden is scheduled to be sworn in on Jan. 20.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is willing to look through that chaos, but not through this anticipation of faster and bigger stimulus,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings, data ahead\nIn the normal business of markets, fourth-quarter earnings season begins with the rollout of big banks\u2019 reports Friday, when JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on tap. There is also a long list of Fed speakers including Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled for a webcast from Princeton University Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, CPI inflation data is released Wednesday and December\u2019s retail sales are reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index will be important, and although it is expected to show muted inflation, markets have begun to price in rising expectations in the bond market. One bond market inflation measure, the 10-year breakeven, went as high as 2.1% Thursday, meaning investors expect that to be the average level of inflation over the next 10 years.\n*****\n&gt; But strategists said little will matter but stimulus, which economists expect will ease the impact of the surging virus on the economy. The U.S. reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid in one day for the first time Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market may also begin to pause as soon as the coming week, as the virus surge continues and investors worry vaccines are being too slowly deployed,\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou feel like this recovery rally is going to run out of legs,\u201d Hogan said. He said that with the S&amp;P 500 up about 16% since Nov. 4, investors may begin to think it is getting ahead of itself.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat could be next week\u2019s business to contemplate. You\u2019re likely to take some sort of breather,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said there\u2019s a level on the S&amp;P 500 that could be a turning point for the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,824 Friday, up 18% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a chance we could be hitting 3,900 and that\u2019s a key level for markets,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThat\u2019s the level where people are looking for a local top. That\u2019s a level where we could be repelled. It\u2019s a number where if we blast through it, it would be good but if we don\u2019t break through it, it could start the correction. It\u2019s a binary risk.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But even if there is a pullback, Lee expects the S&amp;P 500 to reach 4,300 by year end. \u201cI think what the stock market is saying is we\u2019re going to get a really good economy this year,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season should be a positive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUncertainty has plagued everyone, so the certainty that comes with earnings is good for stocks,\u201d said Lee.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/C0LIthO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/naBACT7.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3qF2U4y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WfEELCq.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUvCcqT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/99vHejZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ABV4hoR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OWCbndT.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/PrdtNkQ8/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/sfYjV27r/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/hv1cMCcj/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Cyclicals Climb, Defensives Decline\n\n&gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, cyclical sectors are leading the way higher in 2021 as Energy, Materials, and Financials are all up around 5% or more compared to the S&amp;P 500's gain of a more modest 1.65% YTD. That outperformance has led to some sharp moves in the relative strength lines of several sectors. As shown below, the Materials sector and Financials have both seen sharp moves higher in their relative strength lines versus the S&amp;P 500. For Materials, this has been part of a broader trend of outperformance (upward trending line) that has been in place over the past year. For Financials, prior to this most recent upswing, the line first began to trend higher in the late Fall but then took some pause in December. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Health Care, and Industrials have also made moves higher, albeit more modest than those of Materials and Financials.\n\n&gt; As for the other sectors' relative strength lines, there have been some sharp moves in the opposite direction. Starting with what had been market leaders at various points of the past year, Communication Services and Technology are perhaps some of the most notable negative reversals. For the former, the relative strength line has generally moved sideways over the past year, but since mid-December, the line has been on the decline with one of the most dramatic legs lower taking place in the past week. Tech was a consistent outperformer in the first half of 2020, but since the summer that outperformance has faltered. The sector's relative strength line peaked and has been trending sideways since the start of September and the move so far in 2021 has brought the line down towards the low end of the past few months' range. As for other sectors, Real Estate, Utilities, and Consumer Staples have been trending lower for the better portion of the past year, but with cyclical sectors flying, the relative strength lines of these more defensive sectors have made new lows this week in dramatic fashion.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-RS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sector Breadth Strong\n\n&gt; Several measures of market breadth have been showing strength recently as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. Over 80% of S&amp;P 500 stocks trade above their 50-DMAs, more than half are overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA), and over 20% of S&amp;P 500 stocks reached new 52-week highs yesterday. Additionally, shorter-term breadth as measured by the 10-day advance-decline line has also been strong. Pretty much across the board, every sector's 10-day A/D line has tipped into overbought levels. That doesn't apply to only Consumer Staples and Real Estate which have more modest readings, though breadth for these sectors has still been positive recently. At the moment, Materials, Health Care, and Financials are the most overbought sectors by this measure. Overall, the sharp moves higher in the 10-day A/D lines does flash a warning sign for the very near term that things are running a bit hot.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-10-day-AD.png))**\n\n&gt; As previously mentioned, several sectors are reaching new 52-week highs, and given breadth has been strong to match, cumulative advance-decline lines are confirming the moves higher. As shown in the charts below, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Industrials, Materials, as well as the broader S&amp;P 500 all closed at 52-week highs last week and so too did those sectors\u2019 cumulative A/D lines. While price did not close at new highs, Tech, Financials, and Communication Services also all saw new highs in their cumulative AD lines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-cumulative-breadth.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Off to Strong Start to 2021\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Russell 3,000 is already up 5.24% year-to-date after just four trading days. And to think, major indices were down ~1% on the first trading day of the year this past Monday. Below we highlight the average YTD performance of stocks by sector in the Russell 3,000. Remember, the Russell 3,000 contains large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps, and it covers roughly 98.5% of all US-traded market cap. As shown, Energy stocks have jumped out to the strongest start to the year with an average gain of 13.26%. Materials rank second with a gain of 9.1%, and then Industrials, Financials, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary are all bunched together with gains between 5% and 6%. Technology stocks -- last year's big leaders -- are 'only' up 4.34% on average so far in 2021, while the Real Estate sector is the only one that has averaged declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/sectorsavg.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at Industry Groups, while Technology as a whole is underperforming a bit, the Semiconductor group (which are part of the Tech sector) is up big with average YTD gains of 9.4%. Autos are also performing very well with a gain of 9.2%. Thank you Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/r3kgroups.png))**\n\n&gt; There are already more than 600 stocks in the Russell 3,000 that are up more than 10% year-to-date. That represents 20% of the index.\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the top-performing stocks so far in 2021. Usually, it takes weeks or months to see YTD gains like these, but we've gotten here in just four trading days. 3D Systems (DDD) ranks first with a gain of 119%, followed by Atomera (ATOM) at 70%, ViewRay (VRAY) at 59.5%, Arcturus (ARCT) at 54%, and Akerna (KERN) at 52%. We don't fault you if you have never heard of these names!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/beststocksytd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Equity Winners and Losers in 2020\n\n&gt; 2020 was a good year for stock investors despite unprecedented challenges.\n\n&gt; After being down more than 30% at the March 2020 lows, the S&amp;P 500 Index ended the year with a solid 18.4% total return. Last year marked the first time the index ended a year positive after being down at least 30% during that year. Gains were driven primarily by the emerging economic recovery taking hold, bolstered by massive stimulus, and the remarkably fast COVID-19 vaccine development that encouraged market participants to begin to price in the end of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; We take a look at some of the asset class and sector winners and losers in 2020.\n\n&gt; Massive growth outperformance. The growth style of investing had one of its biggest runs ever relative to the value style in 2020, benefiting from better positioning for the pandemic, superior earnings growth, and balance sheet strength. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the major growth indexes returned over 30% while the value indexes produced mid-single-digit gains. The technology sector was the biggest driver of growth outperformance (about 60% of it), but the consumer discretionary sector\u2014led by Amazon, one of the biggest stay-at-home stocks\u2014also outperformed the broad markets and value indexes by a wide margin last year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical January Trading: Mixed Results since 2000\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s mixed market performance with mega-cap tech shares declining while other major indexes moving higher is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. The only difference is it has usually been tech moving higher while other areas of the market retreated. Since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a0a002cdd46e852712841fbd1688c132/24a9987a98ef15dd-ec/s500x750/ba4983415f1eddedf6687d8d793c86b9c732f497.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xqhdHaoXUw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NXQuP7o.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WjsRkdd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qrT91FG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/O2aSUyP.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mitgWeG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xWZfXGx.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vplnuuc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oCqgrUS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qKlnVyr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mfw4byl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "Greetings to all who read this,\n\ntoday I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**\n\nIntro to QS: \" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*\n\n\u00b7 Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)\n\n\u00b7 Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)\n\n* \u201cQS Stock Risk:\n\nThis stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be \"very high risk\". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.\n\nOur recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.\"**\n\n\u00b7 Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.\n\n\u00b7 Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.\n\n\u00b7 Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u00b7 More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).\n\n\u00b7 We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.\n\n\u00b7 While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \\-- approximately $808 million.\n\n\u00b7  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.\n\n\u00b7 Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that \"subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.\"\n\n\u00b7 While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.\n\n\u00b7 Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.\n\n\u00b7 The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*\n\n## \u00b7Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants\n\n\u00b7 Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants \u201cwill become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*\n\n\u00b7 Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.\n\n* Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms.\n* Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares. Among the top 15 include the likes of:\n\n1. Porsche automobil Holding, with 19.56% ownership,\n2. Khosla Ventures LLC, with 9.76%,\n3. Capricorn Investment LLC, with 6.71%\n4. L. Doerr , with 5.59% and\n5. Jagdeep Singh with 4.84%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Next, I filtered through a Google search, focusing on news involving QS or its shareholders. This is what I found:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* NEW YORK, Jan. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxinmXVVLrJDxKXZ51kUy069jt6KYCVWfxv-xmrrVleGnnjI41ZIjHtVkE7V1tBU-F7u6qoBkkbZq2k4sxaA3WGwbEZTD6Y14D4iXLD4nmgqDb) announces that it has commenced an investigation of QuantumScape Corporation (\u201cQuantumScape\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: QS) on behalf of investors concerning the Company\u2019s possible violations of federal securities laws.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* On January 4, 2021, *Seeking Alpha* published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape\u2019s solid state batteries that make it *\u201ccompletely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.\u201d* Specifically, it stated that the battery\u2019s power means it \u201c*will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving.\u201d* As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive, *\u201cthe power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower.\u201d*\n\nOn this news, the Company\u2019s stock price fell almost 40% during intraday trading on January 4, 2021.\n\n[**Wolf Haldenstein**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxilkDLpHhrmI0w9pWxLiwZxzgbfa0LW6wu-ssajWNDjgU-zgz7CpsCaXj9SXd2mcPUg==) has extensive experience in the prosecution of securities class actions and derivative litigation in state and federal trial and appellate courts across the country. The firm has attorneys in various practice areas and offices in New York, Chicago and San Diego. The reputation and expertise of this firm in shareholder and other class litigation has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have appointed it to major positions in complex securities multi-district and consolidated litigation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* MILWAUKEE, Jan. 4, 2021 /Newswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating possible securities fraud claims against QuantumScape (NASDAQ: QS) resulting from inaccurate statements QuantumScape made regarding its business operations and prospects.\n\nClick here to learn more about the investigation: [http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3025642-1&amp;h=1038669832&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).\n\nThe investigation focuses on whether QuantumScape properly disclosed the significant limitations of its solid-state battery products in order to be acceptable for real world field electric vehicle performance. Specifically, according to a Seeking Alpha research report, QuantumScape's solid state battery products (i) last only for \"260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving\", (ii) have a daily range of only about \"75-100 miles at full capacity in winter temperature conditions\", (iii) will charge only to 5% in 15 minutes rather than 80% at 15 minutes in winter conditions, and (iv) will have an energy density lower than competitors.\n\nIf you wish to obtain additional information or have information about this investigation of Splunk, please contact X....\n\n[http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3025642-1&amp;h=1038669832&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).\n\n**Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:**\n\n[https://archive.vn/Thdc8](https://archive.vn/Thdc8)\n\nFor anyone willing to dive deep enough, I recommend having a look through their patent applications on Google Patents here: [https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1)\n\nAlso, a quick Google Scholar search on solid-state lithium batteries, should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there. Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.\n\nI also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, check out r/QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Tl;dr:\n\n* Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future.\n* But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.\n* Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.\n* There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.\n* People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.\n* In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.\n* Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to c.b.a.t (mods have banned because of market cap), another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause c.b.a.t to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \\~$9. I am personally going long both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYours truly,\n\nNathMcLovin!",

        "selftext": "First, at the top, for those of us here who can't read... TSLA  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nOkay, I need you guys to listen, and listen good because I am going to go over a lot of already known public information about TSLA that somehow the gummy bears here keep forgetting, or just are not accounting for.\n\nTSLA is more than a car business, it's more than a solar power company, and it's more than a tech company.  TSLA has the absolute best long term solution for solar power roofing on the market right now when factoring in maintenance costs, power bill savings, and all installation.  Clean energy over the next few years is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in general because of the movements the USA will make in order to promote clean energy as a country, and the world as a whole will follow.  This means that there will be lots of new properties being built with solar panels, and there will be lots of people who are doing roof repairs swapping to solar panels.  TSLA already has factories in multiple countries, and has the infrastructure to quickly scale up to meet demand, which we have seen back with their model 3 production ramp up, and now with their massive funding, they should be able to do so much more effectively this time than the last.  TSLA will make a lot of money this year, next year, and onward off of their solar panels alone, and they will likely sell very well with the 25 year TSLA warranty in conseration.\n\nSolar market recap/summary:\n\nTSLA has the best solution, competitive pricing for premium roofing, and long term performance because of the 25 year warranty.\n\nTSLA has factories in most of the world already, and is able to scale up really fast in order to meet rapid demand as the demonstrated with the model 3.\n\nNow, that's just the beginning, FSD will have a massive impact when they achieve it because they will no longer be taking market share just from the car industry, but also from uber/lyft/grubhub, etc.  Elon has said before that they want to eventually have enough cars in production to roll out FSD taxi's.  They said initially, they will leave the steering wheel for user override, with the intention of eventually having enough of the roads being self driving cars, and the software being mature enough to remove the steering wheel (we'll see about it, I'm not one to go against papa Elon, but I don't know if people would be okay with that in the next 5 years +).  Elon also said in the same conference, that he wants to allow existing Tesla owners to be able to lend their cars back to Tesla to let them be a part of the FSD taxi service with all profits going to the owner of the car instead of Tesla, which will give them a faster ramp up time in every area because Teslas are popular enough, and the need for extra income is always there, like you retards know.  \n\nSo, to summarize all of this, Tesla isn't a car company, or a solar company, or whatever kind you can think of because Tesla is really just something we haven't seen before, and it will continue to grow, and amaze us in how much of the world they will be able to profit off of.\n\nThis is also why we don't need to worry so much about Tesla competitors in this sense because they are so far ahead of the curve that they aren't playing in a fair fight.  Tesla is done with cars, papa Elon wants to get to a point where nobody owns a car, and everyone uses the Tesla-Express.  This will cripple the insurance business for individual car insurance, since only people who own cars will need it.\n\nThis post is getting long, and so I won't get into all the other upsides of their batteries, and charging stations, but I will say that the upside is just as massive.\n\nGranted, at a certain point papa Elon said this robo-taxi would be ready in 2020+, I would expect it to be ready numbers wise 2022-2023, and infrastructure, and regulation hurdles in production 2024-2025.  I am not saying that TSLA will be uphill constantly on this trip, and that there is not a bubble, but what I am saying is that all of those things accounted for, the entire upside of the company, in terms of it's impact to the world, and how much the world will eventually rely on it, the price is far under where it will be, and this will be competing in the same scale as Amazon within no time (relatively speaking).\n\nTLDR:\n\nTSLA has massive unaccounted for potential on their robo-taxi, and solar roofing future, and even if we are in a bubble, TSLA will eventually be a name everyone knows by name because they own, or use one of their products.  TSLA \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will get better at writing these, I need my IQ to drop a bit more from WSB before I can get some real quality out.\n\nThanks guys.\n\nSources:  \n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1249210220200550405?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1249210220200550405%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\\_&amp;ref\\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caranddriver.com%2Fnews%2Fa32159871%2Ftesla-robo-taxis-still-coming-2020%2F](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1249210220200550405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1249210220200550405%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caranddriver.com%2Fnews%2Fa32159871%2Ftesla-robo-taxis-still-coming-2020%2F)  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1nDnnv\\_Og](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1nDnnv_Og)",

        "selftext": "So this company is starting to get quite a bit of traction so wanted to do a legit DD on this - the ticker symbol is CPSH. It's a company called CPS Technologies and their main product is AlSiC, which is a proprietary patent protected component that goes into transportation vehicles (electric/hybrid), wind turbines, aerospace products (YES EVEN NASA IS USING THIS FOR THEIR MARS ROVER) and army vehicles/armors, etc. \n\n**Below is what's used for transportations:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wrooyxn07b61.png?width=1075&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0d3e1ef0e8ca49a3acc89515f0bed83ea9f6d7d\n\n**This is for wind turbines:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1f2djjp07b61.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7880aa1b1c8cf1672be6aa4154ecf9d50c8dcf78\n\n**Automotive**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qrso43r07b61.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=249fb3680eb85b5dcb8ec52f8b802537ebaa46ad\n\n**Aerospace:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfysj0gt07b61.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d181c424e3c0c013d15661063788e22e45a42e12\n\n**Armor:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0evzyrv07b61.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e24943ba9991c4d80cbb0ac81d19c798ea6539c9\n\n**Defense electronics:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1rsshdx07b61.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3578727f59cce2d7d47e973773ac0ecdfeca59ae\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the list goes on and on... all this to say, this stock might actually be a jackpot. It's literally the key supplier that's plugged into the entire $2 trillion market ecosystem boost that's about to happen. I almost see this as an ETF of its own plugged into so many different industries and applications that'll moon under Biden's administration. This also has gotten the attention of Deadnsyde ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-EvW57Xoo&amp;ab\\_channel=Deadnsyde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-EvW57Xoo&amp;ab_channel=Deadnsyde)) which builds even more credibility. \n\nIt has gone up a bit but this has much more room to run. Combined with tomorrow's announcement, I can see this easily hitting $20-30 in the near term, and even higher by eoy. \n\nFor those wondering, here are the financials:\n\n* No debt\n* Positive operating profit (unlike some of those penny stocks that are bleeding money every year and have poor financials)\n* Taken from Q3 2020 results transcript: \" Today, we announced revenues of $4.5 million and an operating profit of $253,000 for the quarter ended September 26, 2020.\"\n* What's shocking is that their full year revenue was struck heavily by COVID AND two of their major customers experiencing black swan situations but they STILL experienced positive growth compared to 2019. \n\nDon't miss this chance guys. Get in while you can when it's below $10!!",

        "selftext": "[Previously, on Guess the Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ksvib2/guess_the_company_5_ticker_trivia_due_diligence/)\n\nHi fellow kids, I'm back again today with yet another DD where I reveal the ticker at the end rather than the beginning.\n\nLet's see how quickly you can figure out which company this is:\n\n\\-This NYSE listed company is trading at the same level as where it was 1 year ago, gaining 80% since its lowest point in March 2020\n\n\\-This company has a 5 year average return on capital of 6.1%, compared to its industry's average of 0.91%.\n\n\\-Based in New York, this company was founded by Henry Wells and William Fargo\n\n\\-As of the last report, this company has $46b of total debt\n\n\\-This company recently drew the attention of federal investigators who are looking into whether it has been using \"misleading and aggressive sales tactics\" to sell its products\n\n\\-With over 100 million customers, this company facilitates over $1 trillion in revolving credit annually\n\n\\-In 2016, this company lost an exclusive partnership with a multinational corporation to Citigroup.\n\n\\-Losing this one single partnership COST this company about 10% of its revenue!\n\n\\-This company currently pays a quarterly dividend of 43 cents\n\n\\-Its largest shareholder Berkshire Hathaway inc owns approximately 18% of this company\n\nHave you made your guess yet?\n\nIf your guess was &gt;!WFC (Wells Fargo &amp; Co), you would be wrong! !&lt;\n\n&gt;!The correct answer is actually AXP (American Express Co.). Outlook for AXP: AMEX is becoming more and more aggressive with its sales tactics to coerce business owners into accepting their product while at the same time sticking to its modus operandi of charging 50% higher merchant fees than its competitors Visa and Mastercard on the basis that AMEX cardholders are perceived as affluent. According to American Express, AMEX cardholders average 60% higher income than non-AMEX cardholders. This statistic is probably skewed by the fact that Warren Buffet has been carrying an AMEX card since 1964.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!With e-commerce and alternative payment options on the rise, physical charge cards are going to become a thing of the past. Amex's business model which revolves almost entirely around collecting merchant fees is on shaky grounds.  TLDR: Boomer stock, no thanks. OPTAP: $120!&lt;\n\nDisclaimer: I do not hold any positions in this company. This is not financial or investment advice.",

        "selftext": "First, to reduce any confusion, the company will be referred to as Papa John's and the person will be referred to as Schnatter.\n\nI was joking about the idea to take over Papa John's with some of my friends yesterday to get Schnatter back in control of his company, and when I started doing my research I actually liked what I saw purely from an investment standpoint. This post will have two main parts: how we can get Schnatter his job back and also how we can easily make money on PZZA. We'll do the money stuff first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chart**\n\nAs of writing this, PZZA is currently trading at $94.10 and the ATH is $102.25. It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH. It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average, so there is no resistance until ATH. This is great for options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6klbqs2u4a61.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a797b3678678bd167818ee455dcde4d49f6e4512\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, I suspect that PZZA could be forming a cup and handle pattern. If this plays out, the price target would be (ATH + (ATH - Bottom of Cup)), which is about $131.38. However, we won't know if this is a cup and handle until it happens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umhvpr1ou4a61.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b468ffd791469758f0679d390c4b6d72cad01a35\n\nEven if the pattern fails, a delivery pizza restaurant is a pretty safe place for your money to be during the pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other Numbers**\n\n[Target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PZZA/research-ratings) of $104.50 with a high of $116.00. I think this is low going off the chart.\n\n[31 million shares](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) float. I know that's a lot, but Schnatter already owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile).\n\nGuys, it's take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company, which should help PZZA stock even more. As you will see, ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position.\n\n**Why Schnatter Left**\n\nIn 2017, he made a controversial comment about how the [NFL player protests were hurting Papa John's sales](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/22/572779230/papa-johns-ceo-steps-down-following-controversial-remarks-on-nfl) because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. I don't want this to get political, but this is essential to talk about. Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors. Fast forward into 2018, where Schnatter was reported to have [used a racial slur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/?sh=376e4e6e4cfc) in a meeting and it was recorded. Then, he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company (besides for shareholder).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Schnatter's Fight for Innocence**\n\nEver since both of these allegations have surfaced, Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA) Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast (I know many people don't care for them, myself included, but those opinions don't change what Schnatter says in the interview) where he explained why both allegations were false. Regarding the NFL drama, Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue. [His exact words were,](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/ex-fbi-director-clears-papa-johns-founder-of-racial-bias-slams-clearly-inaccurate-media) \"*The NFL is hurting, and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner\u2019s satisfaction, NFL leadership has hurt Papa John\u2019s shareholders.\"* In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur, former FBI director Louis Freeh, wrote a [report](https://papajohnschnatter.report/read-the-report) where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur, he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism, and when he said the word, he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him. There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released. The first part includes him using the slur and the context, and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how \"they got him\" and they needed to get it to the press right away. This is all according to the H3 interview. It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him, and the company seems intent on keeping it secret, showing that they are likely hiding something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sales are Slumping**\n\n[Sales are decreasing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221441/papa-johns-total-revenue/#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20Papa%20John's%20worldwide%202007%2D2019&amp;text=American%20pizza%20restaurant%20franchise%20Papa,seeing%20a%20decline%20in%20revenue) every year since his role as been minimized. It's as simple as that. They are in no way a failing company, they are just making less money than they were.\n\n*Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61...*\n\nIn addition to slumping sales, in the [H3 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA), Schnatter claims that Papa John's total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased. He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality. In my personal experience, I can say the quality at my local Papa John's has decreased over the past couple years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why Schnatter Can Fix This**\n\nSchnatter is more devoted to Papa John's than most CEOs (after Karp and Elon), even though he technically doesn't work for them anymore. As I said before, he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants. The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales. Who else still puts effort into a company after they've been fired from it? Also, this is just speculation, but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What we can do**\n\nIt's simple, buy shares! If we buy enough shares of PZZA, we (along with Schnatter) can become the majority shareholder of the company. There are [just over 31 million shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) and Schnatter still owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile), or 3.88% of the company. If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again, we can easily call a shareholder meeting, vote out those who wrongly accused him, and put him, back in charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Historical Implications**\n\nSchnatter has long been touting \"The Day of Reckoning\" but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened, if it is multiple events, or what it will be specifically. If we can accomplish this, WSB would go down in history (it already has) again for giving a man his company back... and we will make money in the process. We can be the day of reckoning!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is This Legal?**\n\nYes, it is perfectly legal. This would technically be a hostile takeover, which is legal, but we can just call it something else. Besides, I'm pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nPZZA chart shows easy money, Schnatter is innocent of accusations, only he can bring Papa John's back to its former glory, and we can be the ones to do that. The Day of Reckoning is here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPZZA PLTR GME SPCE ICLN TSLA \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso if I misspelled \"Schnatter\" anywhere I'm sorry.",

        "selftext": "Here is a link to a court case from 7 years ago where I got most of my DD from, between SolarMax v it\u2019s former CFO (which SolarMax allegedly fired for whistleblowing on its shady dealings): https://www.helmerfriedman.com/docs/McCaffrey-SolarMax-Complaint.pdf\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hXWAjqX.jpg\n\n-SolarMax allegedly faked sales numbers by buying SolarPanels from a Chinese company and then selling it back to the same Chinese company\u2019s US subsidiary\n\n-SolarMax originally wanted to IPO for just $16m... \n\nhttps://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/72762/Solar-energy-company-SolarMax-Technology-withdraws-$16-million-IPO-plans-to\n\n-Instead, now it\u2019s getting $300M from ALAC.. a Chinese SPAC that was nearing expiry and had to merge with somebody. Anybody. So that the founders can get their payout. \n\n-SolarMax allegedly had approximately 47 shareholders at the time of the case, many of which were using SolarMax as a way to obtain a green card via the EB-5 immigration Visa. \n\n-The EB-5 immigration and visa program is notorious for being subject to abuse and fraud. Indeed, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the USCIS have jointly issued an Investment Alert in which they warn potential investors \u201cabout fraudulent investment scams that exploit the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as \u2018EB-5.\u2019\u201d \n\n-SolarMax cherry picked the best 12 months from Sep 30 2018-sep 30 2019 and still only had $57m of sales to show. This is not a new emerging company. SolarMax has been around 2008, they\u2019re not gonna get much better than $15m of sales a quarter. And that\u2019s if they\u2019re not faking those sales by shipping stuff from China to sell back to the same company that sold it to them in China. \n\n-according to this filing, ALAC only has $15m left in the trust https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1748621/000121390020035974/f10q0920_albertonacq.htm\n\n-How the f is this company valued anywhere near $300m??????\n\nThis SPAC is riding on nothing but green energy hype IMO it\u2019s full of red flags. I\u2019d be surprised if this stock even holds at $10 after merger let alone $14.90\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to hold ALAC thru the merger, all I can say is best of luck to you and this link might come in handy later: https://www.rl-legal.com/cases-alberton-acquisition-corporation\n\nTLDR: SolarMax fired its own CFO for uncovering faking sales and abusing the EB5 immigration program.\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t have any positions in ALAC. This is not investment advice.",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019m not sure to flair this as DD or discussion as I\u2019m not sure myself, first time posting here.\n\nI know this stock hasn\u2019t been talked about for some time here, but I\u2019d like to know your opinions.\n\nAtm I might be drunk so definitely ask for clarification. Shoot it down ifI\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m ok with that. Failure is part of the learning process.\n\nAt the moment it\u2019s pretty clear that the ARM deal, as the P/E of 115 would suggest, probably in a relatively rational market is one of the few things that would justify its current value. \n\nAnd as some of us would know from a few months ago, this deal can\u2019t go through without the approval of the Chinese and Europeans, the biggest being of course the Chinese.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know why the takeover is a big deal: ARM is a British company who controls the biggest share of patents on IP cores: \u201ca reusable unit of logic, cell or integrated circuit layout design\u201d acoording to Wikipedia, so they\u2019re makig their revenue by selling their patented chip designs, thus being integral to a huge part of the semiconductor industry. \n\nWhat people fear is that this would mean a near-monopoly in this semi-conductor industry by Nvidia: e.g. ARM delivers around 90% of the smartphone chips. Given the fact that Nvidia is trying to grow in the data centre and AI development sectors, ARM is pivotal in this. It would be like getting a scientist in Civilization V: a huge boost in comparison to their competitors, of which INTL consistently underperforms and AMD is still not yet on the level if it comes to GPU\u2019s.\n\n\nGiven the fact this would give Nvidia a lot of power in China: ARM has a joint venture in China and being a US company they might not trust this deal carries a big risk. Even though Softbank, ARM and Nvidia were confident that this deal would go through the 18-month paperwork that is this takeover, but since Jack Ma has been gone missing, things might look different.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people here saying it\u2019s the CCP being butthurt, but I\u2019ve got a different view of it, and I thought it was the Washington Post that thought the same: the CCP wakes up to the danger that the big tech and data companies provide as they present a enormous threat to their power. Being dependent on Western technology and Biden still willing to continue the hard line (albeit in a more subtle way) of Trump towards China the stance towards US companies doesn\u2019t change. The stance of the CCP towards tech companies in general might. And thus the initially already unsure deal becomes even more unsure, as the Brits fear that the takeover will lose jobs and knowledge in their country. \n\nI\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on this: how has the Jack Ma incident changed the CCP\u2019s stance on technology? And how does it affect the Western companies? There might still change a lot in the temaining 15 months but I myself do expect a harder line towards Western tech companies in China. I\u2019d love to hear your arguments against and for.\n\nBull case: I\u2019d say they\u2019re leading in some very potential big industries and they are very able to convert that lead: the competition is still far away. With ARM they will consolidate this.\n\nBear case: When looking at the P/E it\u2019s overvalued and potential upside is priced in and it seems that due to the wait of the approval the stock atm is going sideways, and there might be resistance against the deal. I\u2019ve not mentioned it earlier but also the Europeans don\u2019t seem too happy with this, not to mention China which I did mention.\n\nI hope you\u2019ve become any wiser of this, questions or sources do ask.\n\nFor those who ask positions I\u2019ve been owning 2 shares since June/July bc I\u2019m poor.",

With a fancy app on your phone you can see your blood sugar live, instead of heaving to puncture yourself with a needle and draw blood. \nIt checks all the boxes: a disruptor, under the radar, huge TAM (80 billon+), healthcare tech, and a SaaS model with huge marins. The nice thing about the company is that they have a low market cap, they are CE certified and started selling their product in Germany, Ireland and the UK in Q4. In the slideshow they say they are already making revenue in these countries, so I expect a nice surprise when earnings come around. \nFDA approval is expected at the end of 2021. Competitors are big pharma, but because NMRD focusses only on their sugarbeat product, I believe that this gives them an advantage. \n\nAlso: they match up to their competitors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mujq9_wDOw  \n\nProfit margins are also very nice with a subscription model and data collection.

We serve industries, energy and gas companies with leading hydrogen technology. Our roots date back to 1927, and since then, we have had a proud history of  development and continuous improvement of hydrogen technologies. Today, our hydrogen solutions cover the entire value chain from hydrogen production technologies to  hydrogen fuelling stations, enabling industries to transition to green hydrogen, and providing all fuel cell electric vehicles with the same fast fuelling and long range as fossil-fuelled vehicles \u2013 without the emissions.\n\n**Why am I interested?**\n\n2020 has been an accelerant to the move into greener, more sustainable energy. EU wants to be carbon neutral by 2050, China by 2060 and soon the US (once Biden is in power) will also want to be carbon neutral by 2050 + Biden\u2019s $2 trillion infrastructure and renewable energy plan.\n\nMost people believe that battery power is the future. In my opinion it is, but not on its own. Current battery tech is limited often in range, we are in the works of inventing new types of battery (Look at Quantumscope) however, before they are commercially available on large scale, cost efficient is still years away.\n\nHydrogen is nothing new. Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements on planet earth meaning access to this type of renewable energy is basically infinite. By using electrolysis, Hydrogen can be produced from water and renewable energy. However, green hydrogen is becoming more and more affordable to produce, meaning that start to finish no CO2 is emitted and we are nearing in this decade large scale green hydrogen production.\n\nMultiple projects have been started in the EU over the last two years and I believe this trend will continue on, also in line with carbon neutral plans of at least two large nations in the world.\n\nApplications for hydrogen are very broad\n\n\\- Industrial use (Examples: oil refining, ammonia production, steel production)\n\n\\- Transportation (Limited low carbon fuel available as present; Hydrogen opportunity// Fuel cell costs also important)\n\n\\- Buildings (replacing natural gas, direct use for boilers or fuel cells)\n\n\\- Power generation (leading for storing renewable energy; can be used to increase power system flexibility; ammonia can be applied in coal power plants to reduce emission)\n\n**Why Nel ASA?**\n\nQ3 Highlights\n\n* a screenshot of Q3 ER presentation should be here, but not allowed to add image\\*\n\n\\- World\u2019s largest electrolyser company.\n\n\\- \u20ac242 million cash (enough to cover R&amp;D and burn rate).\n\n\\- Excellent group management with experts from varied industries.\n\n\\- 3-Yr revenue growth 74.05% // 5-yr 112.19%.\n\n\\- Revenue has improved YoY since 2014, not yet profitable but close too.\n\n\\- Entered MoU with Iberdrola to develop green hydrogen plant in spain. Capacity 200MW. Operational 2023.\n\nIt is not necessarily a play which seems safe at the moment, as financials are not positive yet, however are improving, I am holding this stock till at least 2025. They also have enough cash to cover operations. In the annual report they do mention that once they are in a position to pay dividend they will, however that is not the play here. I have been vested in this company for over a year and I strongly believe in it. The company is growing steady, more and more projects in the backlog, awarded multiple government grants over the last 6 months. It is a renewable energy play for the coming decade (imo)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost Recent Contract:\n\n\\- EverFuel Contract for Fredericia Hydrogen project \u2013 20MW electrolyser to be delivered in 2021 and fully operational mid-2022.

        "selftext": "Hi r/securityanalysis, I am trying to become better at researching investment ideas and here is a piece I recently put together. I would love some feedback and a discussion on your thoughts on it. \n\n**The Situation and Company Background**\n\nAffirm is a leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) provider that allows consumers to have the flexibility to pay for their purchase over a period of 6 weeks to 48 months with merchants that have added Affirm as a payment option. The company is expected to trade under the ticker \u201cAFRM\u201d and start trading next Wednesday with price talk around $38/share, which equates to an equity value of around $9.2B. This is a severely lower valuation than other fintech peers such as Afterpay, Square, and Shopify. We believe that AFRM should be valued at least $20B to $30B using a conservative FY23 EV/Sales total company comp of 13x compared to Afterpay at 18.3x, SHOP at 28.1x, and Visa and Mastercard around 16x. \n\nThe company mainly operates in the United States, and as of September 30th, has already partnered with over 6,500 merchants and has 3.9M active consumers but recently acquired PayBright, a Canadian based BNPL provider. Affirm generates most of their revenue through fees charged to merchants when a customer uses the BNPL option at checkout. Additionally, the company generates revenue through simple interest charged to consumers that have chosen to extend their payment options beyond the interest-free payment length. Merchant fees range from 2 \u2013 3% while APR ranges from 0 \u2013 30%. Additionally, the company earns fees through customers who utilize a virtual debit card, gains on loans sold to third-party investors, and servicing fees on loans managed by Affirm. \n\nIn FY20 (June end), Affirm saw +92.7% revenue growth to $509.5M, with $256.8M in merchant network revenue (50.4% of revenue) and $186.7M in interest income (36.6% of revenue). Additionally, active customers grew +76.9% to 3.62M active users and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew +77.0% to $4.6B. We note that Affirm is currently reliant on one merchant, Peloton (PTON) for their revenue as the partner accounted for 28% of FY20 revenue and the top 10 merchants accounted for 35% of revenue. \n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\nWe believe that Affirm will be the dominant BNPL provider in the future in the United States that will benefit from increasing usage of BNPL at checkout. We anticipate Affirm\u2019s recent partnerships with e-commerce platform Shopify (SHOP) and payment company Adyen (ADYEN.AS) will help drive a flywheel effect to allow Affirm to establish itself as the dominant BNPL provider in the United States as both platforms will help bring additional merchants and consumers onto the platform. We expect the Shopify partnership to help capture a differentiated market that is underserved compared to competitors Afterpay and Klarna. With the addition of Shopify, hundreds of thousands of vendors can now add a BNPL option seamlessly which will allow Affirm take market share, which will further drive the flywheel effect. \n\nWe also believe that Affirm provides a better product suite than competitors from the perspective of both the merchant and consumer. Affirm\u2019s product provides more flexibility on payment term length compared to its competitors, offers virtual debit cards to allow consumers to use Affirm at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm, and a no fee and competitive high-yield savings account. Additionally, Affirm charges substantially lower merchant fees. Together, we believe merchants are more likely to choose Affirm when deciding on which BNPL company to implement, which will further compound the desirability of implementing Affirm as their consumer and merchant base grows.  \n\nFinally, we anticipate Affirm to serve a Millennial, Gen Z, and Gen X population that has not adopted credit card usage like their older generations. Their generations are more accustomed to online shopping and utilizing digital payments but have built a distrust in traditional credit due to seeing their older friends and family negatively impacted during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n**Comparable Company Analysis and Valuation**\n\n[Comp Sheet](https://imgur.com/CLgDfsK) Source: Factset, and [Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) indicate a fair value of $20B to $30B equity value compared to IPO pricing of around $9.2B. This is another severely underpriced IPO that is poised to pop on the first day of trading. \n\n**Buy Now Pay Later Background**\nAffirm offers a new alternative way that people can transact. Consumers have been utilizing different methods to trade for goods and services since the dawn of man. Transactions have originally started through bartering for different items and goods and evolved into using coins made from precious metals as accepted methods of payment. In a more modern world, we have moved to utilizing paper currency and coinage, and more recently, into credit/debit and digital wallets. The way people shop has also significantly evolved throughout time. Gone are the days merchants carried their wares across different towns. Although we still have outdoor markets much like Greek agoras in 1,000 B.C., we have evolved in the way we pay for goods and services at markets. Local stores and department stores, which dominated the way consumers shopped in the 19th and 20th century, are in a decline. Now, we are entering a new period in how consumers shop; online. With this revolution, we can see continued shifts and advancement in the way people pay and we believe the \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d option is the innovation that has the potential to upend the traditional credit/debit card market.\n\nAffirm will become the second largest publicly traded BNPL provider, behind Australia\u2019s Afterpay. The BNPL payment option is an alternative way for a consumer to pay for product by providing flexibility regarding payment terms and is a point-of-sale (POS) loan.  Although the BNPL payment method is still miniscule compared to traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, accounting for approximately 1% of e-comm sales in 2019, Worldpay\u2019s 2020 Global Payments report expects penetration to increase 3x to 3% of e-comm sales utilizing BNPL by 2023. In EMEA, the payment method is already more established and accounted for 6% of 2019 e-comm payments and Worldpay expects it to reach ~10% penetration by 2023. Market research company eMarketer estimated that U.S. consumers spent $590B on e-comm in 2019. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the first 3 quarters of 2020 had 16.3% of retail sales ex-auto penetration through e-comm, compared to 12.5% in the same period LY, and e-comm dollars spent grew +34.2%. With the pandemic reshaping how consumers shop and accelerating the growth of e-comm sales usage and spending, we believe that BNPL usage could potentially beat Worldpay\u2019s estimates. \n\nAnother key piece for Affirm\u2019s success relates to their credit risk model. Unlike a traditional credit card where a consumer is approved for a credit limit at the time of application, Affirm provides a credit limit in addition to analyzing risk at the transaction level and can approve/reject purchases at the time of purchase. The company\u2019s risk model has allowed them to approve 20% more customers compared to other competitors while still limiting delinquency and default rates. Additionally, their 36-month delinquency rate is more than 50% lower than the credit card industry average of 2.5%, with a rate of 1.1%. We also estimate that AFRM\u2019s net charge-off rates are also about 50% lower than industry average, ending FY20 with 1.8% of loans charged off compared to the credit card industry average of 3.7% in the same period. Although traditional credit card companies can lower a consumer\u2019s credit limit at any point in time, they are often slow to react as their algorithms rely on antiquated methods such as credit scores, transaction history, and credit usage. This indicates credit card algorithms are utilizing data that could be older than a month to make credit risk decision. Affirm\u2019s proprietary risk model has brought the credit risk model into modern times with real-time economic data in addition to SKU level data to assess risk more advantageously and at a transactional level.\n\n**Why Affirm?**\n\nAlthough Affirm is not the only BNPL provider in the U.S. and was not the first provider, we believe that Affirm\u2019s product suite is superior compared to competitors such as Afterpay and Klarna. Currently, Afterpay only lets consumers split their purchase into 4 interest free payments split in 2-week intervals across 4 payments, spreading payments across 6-weeks. Klarna\u2019s product is essentially identical. Affirm allows consumers to split their purchases monthly for up to 48 months, with most interest free periods ranging up to 12 months. Additionally, we believe Affirm is more compelling for the retailer to utilize because the merchant fees charged are substantially lower (2 \u2013 3%) vs. Afterpay (3 \u2013 6%) and Klarna (up to 5.99%). Affirm also offers a virtual debit card, which lets you use your Affirm account to pay at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm as their chosen BNPL provider. \n\n[Affirm vs. Competitors](https://imgur.com/tVivw6t) Source: Company websites\n\n**How Can Affirm Continue to Grow and Improve?**\n\nAffirm is Still Missing Multiple Pieces to Become the Dominant BNPL Provider. Although we are bullish on Affirm\u2019s long-term prospects and impressed with their current progress, we believe there is still room to improve. We believe two key components of a dominating alternative payment company are still missing, and once implemented, can accelerate new user adoption. (1) Affirm needs to implement a rewards program, similar to traditional credit cards and Klarna\u2019s \u201cVibe\u201d rewards program. Affirm highlighted most of their users have the ability to pay for their purchase in full but prefer the financial flexibility of splitting payments. We believe Affirm\u2019s users are financially responsible consumers and may face hesitation to utilize the BNPL option vs. a credit card as there is no rewards/cash back offering at Affirm. We expect Affirm to offer a rewards program in the near future, which would impact profitability, but would help drive customer acquisition in the long-term. (2) A physical card that allows the user to utilize Affirm\u2019s BNPL option in retail stores could help drive additional GMV growth. The card would be programmed to follow the merchant\u2019s current agreement and timeframe of repayment that the merchant and Affirm have already agreed too. However, if the card is used at a non-partner merchant, AFRM would allow the card to be used as a 0% APR credit card with repayment term lengths determined by their proprietary credit risk model. Recall that a credit card was used to pay in 40% of in-store transactions, and we believe a physical card can help complete AFRM\u2019s product suite. We also believe the card can help bring Affirm on equal footing with competitors that have partnered with substantially more merchants as consumers can use the Affirm card online with any merchant.\n\n**The Bears**\n\nAffirm is in a distant third place with 3.9M active users in the U.S. as of September 30, 2020, trailing Afterpay\u2019s 6.5M active U.S. customers and Klarna\u2019s 10M customers in the same period. Additionally, Affirm currently has 6.5k active U.S. merchant partnerships compared to Afterpay\u2019s 13.9k U.S. partnerships and Klarna\u2019s 235k+ global partners. Lastly, Affirm lags both competitors in GMV. Affirm saw $5.3B in TTM GMV compared to Afterpay\u2019s $11.1B AUD and Klarna\u2019s $35B+ USD from January to September 2020.  We do highlight that Affirm is the leader in average GMV/customer at $1,359 compared to Afterpay at $991 and Klarna at $412, which we believe is due to high exposure to PTON and other higher-AOV retailers.\n\nAffirm is still heavily reliant on Peloton (PTON), but we believe they have a symbiotic relationship. PTON offers Affirm as an option to finance equipment at 0% APR for up to 39 months. Our field checks and PTON\u2019s 10-K indicate that substantial portion of PTON equipment purchases are financed through AFRM. AFRM also disclosed that 28% of FY20 revenue came from their PTON partnership. A big critique of AFRM\u2019s business model is that they are too reliant on one merchant for their revenue. We believe that this could pose a risk in the intermediate future, but analysts expect PTON\u2019s performance through FY2021 (June 30-end) to remain strong. PTON recently reported an explosive 1Q (Sept-30 end) with +233% revenue growth but +281% growth in their connected fitness segment, which is the segment that recognizes sales of their Peloton Bike. \n\n[PTON Connected Fitness Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/734f82O) Source: FactSet and PTON\n\n**Still Undervalued Excluding PTON**\n[Still valued at $22B excluding PTON revenue](https://imgur.com/M5aoT3p) Source: My estimates from backing out PTON revenue contribution\n\n**Valuation**\n\nWe use a blended valuation to arrive to a $94 implied value/share, which provides +147% upside to the high end of the IPO price talk of $33 to $38/share. Our valuation is based on a 75%/25% blend of a multiples-based analysis on FY2023E and a DCF model. Our EV/sales analysis assigns a 16x multiple on merchant network revenue, 12x multiple on interest income revenue, and a 2x multiple on servicing income, virtual card revenue, and gain on sale of loans. This provides a total company EV/sales multiple of 13x FY23 estimates. This is lower than APT\u2019s 18.3x FY23 EV/sales multiple, which we believe is justified due to AFRM\u2019s revenue mix that is more concentrated towards interest income revenue, lower GMV, fewer active customers, and high reliance on one merchant. However, AFRM is a fast-growing alternative payment company that is growing share in a fast-growing industry, has strong partnerships that we believe will help drive growth long-term, and a strong leadership team with successful experience in the internet/payment space. For DCF, we use a WACC of 10.9%.\n\n[13x FY23 EV/Sales Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) Source: FactSet, and [10 Year DCF Analysis](https://imgur.com/dItAhab) Source: My estimates\n\n[Finally, a more conservative sensitivity table indicates ~$73 valuation with a very conservative EV/sales multiple and lower 3-year CAGR assumption.](https://imgur.com/4FAtFHA) Source: My estimates\n\nNote: All ideas are my own and I will be buying the IPO on Wednesday. This does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any security discussed.",

        "selftext": "Several years ago, I was first introduced to the idea of psychedelics for mental health because I followed the work of Jordan Peterson, author of the 12 Rules for Life book that was popular a year or two ago. Before listening to his segment about it, I like many others thought of psychedelics merely as a means to get really high and hope to have fun. I hadn't ever tried them.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MnqXlmLGuc&amp;ab\\_channel=TheArchangel911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MnqXlmLGuc&amp;ab_channel=TheArchangel911)\n\nI now have personal experience with Psilocybin. I'm curious how many on this reddit heard of psychedelics for mental health in a similar fashion, and/or how much of a crossover there is on this sector with those who are also familiar with the work of Peterson (or even the work of Carl Jung, from which Peterson draws much inspiration).\n\nIt seems to me like those interested in depth psychology and the contents of the subconscious are more prone to interest in the application of psychedelics.

Lightning eMotors manufactures powertrains, complete vehicles, and charging solutions for the zero-emission medium-duty commercial market. The company was founded in 2008 and has a manufacturing facility in Loveland, Colorado. There are already 120 vehicles on-road, 1500 vehicles on order. 100% of 2021 and the majority of 2022 are already contracted. They hold a 50% market share in[ class 3 to class 6](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tmguide/tmg_2013/images/figurec-1.jpg) electric vehicles. The ticker symbol will change to $ZEV (cool ticker symbol) upon merging which is set tentatively for mid-February, 2021.\n\nProduct and Business\n\n* All commercial vehicles are built in 2 stages - OEM \u2192 Upfitter (Upfitters are responsible for decking out the trucks based on customer\u2019s requirements. An ambulance truck\u2019s interiors are different from a telecom providers\u2019 truck) \u2192 Customer.\n* ZEV is in the business of manufacturing complete vehicles (based on chassis from OEMs), electrifying the existing fleet (this is basically removing the combustion engine and making it fully electric), charging stations, fleet management software, and financing the purchase orders.\n\nKeyPoints\n\n* A lot of interest has been towards companies like Hyliion, Rivian , Canoo, Arrival. Yes, they look really nice and sleek. But it presents a huge problem for fleet operators - The vehicles have not been tested to be able to depend on them and there is virtually no service partners or services network in the US. If a rearview mirror breaks down, it might take a week or more to receive them. Any downtime is loss of revenue for fleet operators. As ZEV orders its chassis from OEMs like GM, Ford, Hino, Isuzu, and Navistar, they are able to receive spare parts in a matter of hours if not days. Also, the warranty from OEMs carries over as well. This is a huge advantage that ZEV will have over other companies entering this space.\n* Last-mile fleets run 8 classes of vehicles from multiple OEMs (no OEM offers everything). ZEV is the only supplier today that has class 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and Fuel cell trucks/vans. Ford, Rivian, and Arrival have announced Class 2 EVs only. ZEV operates in a niche segment where it does not make business sense for OEMs to channel investments into. The Class 3 and above commercial segment is characterized by low volumes and diverse operational requirements.\n* ZEV can build/assemble about 15 Class 3 and 4 powertrains and vehicles per week right now on a single 8-hour shift. The coaches take a lot longer as they are much more complicated and not yet as automated (but much higher price). This production capacity only equates to less than 4K class 3 and class 4 vehicles. They need serious cash to be able to expand their manufacturing capacity to build 25k vehicles by 2025.\n* More eyeballs on the[ Amazon vehicles in San Diego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1KURWf74o&amp;feature=youtu.be) provided by ZEV. One should remember that Amazon will never be able to source their entire fleet from a sole operator including Rivian. The pie is big enough to be shared by several players in this space.\n\nRisks\n\n* Execution risk as they try to expand their manufacturing facility to 750,000 sq.ft which is only currently at 250,000 sq.ft.\n* GigCaptial3, the SPAC sponsor does not seem to be bringing anything valuable to the table. They seem to be really good at providing 'SPAC in a box' type service, which in this case is perfect for ZEV as they are basically looking for more cash infusion and do not have to worry about all financial and regulatory concerns in going public.\n* As more competitors enter the space in the next 2 to 3 years, it could be a little harder in differentiating.\n\nConclusion\n\nRead Google Doc for full conclusion please because the images are not loading properly on reddit when I copy and paste them over",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I came across this company called National MI holdings (NMIH). This looks like a rare undervalued company in this expensive market, its a small cap company, far away from the Wall Street spotlight, the price has not recovered to the pre-pandemic levels yet and is still offering an interesting discount to its fair value. With the housing market getting higher because of low mortgage rates, these companies will potentially benefit.

        "selftext": "**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    \n    \n# Analysis:    \nHappy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I\u2019m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I\u2019ve bought outright calls. Here is what I\u2019m seeing with Apple: \n    \n## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    \nWhat kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter do to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here\u2019s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    \n    \n## The \u201csuper cycle\u201d rumors appear to be true.    \nAs a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn\u2019t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a \u201csuper cycle\u201d of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I\u2019ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     \n    \n[Here\u2019s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush\u2019s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   \n    \nHere are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don\u2019t read around here.    \n&gt;\"Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds \u2026 **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,\" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    \n    \n&gt;Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a \"stretch goal\" in the mid-80 million range.    \n    \n&gt;Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is \"north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards \u2013 an eye popping figure)\" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    \n    \n&gt;**\"We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.\"**.   \n    \n[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   \nNotable quote:    \n&gt; That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    \n    \n    \nIt\u2019s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    \n    \n## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   \nIt\u2019s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it\u2019s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   \n    \n## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.\nSee further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201crisks\u201d sections.    \n    \n    \n\nApple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here\u2019s a Barron\u2019s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    \n\n    \n    \nApple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that\u2019s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn\u2019t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you\u2019re \u201callowed\u201d to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. \n   \n\nThose are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn\u2019t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   \n    \n## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace\nI can\u2019t track down the things I\u2019ve read here and there on Twitter and I\u2019m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple\u2019s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    \n    \n## App sales are crushing it.   \nThanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     \n\n## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     \nThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that\u2019s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. AT&amp;T may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d for them.    \n    \nApple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     \n    \nIt is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.\n    \n# RISKS\n**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    \nI don\u2019t know.  Based on the reports I\u2019ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn\u2019t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn\u2019t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand}.(https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     \n    \n    \n\n**Macro factors causing a crash**.    \nA lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don\u2019t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it\u2019s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    \n    \n\nI\u2019m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    \n    \nAs we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late \u201821 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it\u2019s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don\u2019t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. \n    \nA much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.\n\n**Bad subscription numbers**    \n\nIf subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn\u2019t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. \n\n**Sales could have cratered in October**    \n\nSales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I\u2019m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don\u2019t really know what October sales look like.\n\n**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    \n\n[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that\u2019s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.\n\n##  Technical Analysis   \nI don\u2019t believe in technical analysis. Charts don\u2019t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person. \n\n## Fun rumors    \nI\u2019m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that\u2019s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn\u2019t really my cup of tea, but if it\u2019s yours those are two things to consider. \n\n## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    \nI\u2019m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn\u2019t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent \u201cto the moon\u201d meme stocks) with limited float. (That\u2019s not to say those aren\u2019t great companies or great trades. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019).\n\n\n## My positions: \nI\u2019m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you\u2019d expect.    \n    \nI have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 APPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that\u2019s going to sit there for the next two years.\n\nBut I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     \n    \nThis puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.\n\n## How to get rich\nI intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don\u2019t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    \n    \nI intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.\n\n## Criticism    \nIf you think I\u2019m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I don\u2019t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If I\u2019m wrong, I want to know it. \n\n## The Most Important Factor    \n\nThis ain\u2019t my first day around here, and I know that DD is absolutely useless without rocketships, therefore: APPLE TO THE \ud83c\udf19  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.     \n\n\n\nGodspeed, fellow autists.",

TSLA and NIO are both examples of EV companies that have capitalized on the gains resulting from being early to the party for electric cars.\n\n\nAwesome. But there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet, and that this company has a first-mover advantage on (just like NIO and TSLA did): **The medium-heavy duty vehicles.**\n\nToday, I present you with an opportunity to be early to this party featuring the sleeping giant that is:\n\n#LION ELECTRIC ($NGA)\n\nIt is currently trading under the SPAC ticker $NGA with a merger completion set for the end of Q1. \n\n**That\u2019s right, by buying 1 share of $NGA right now, you are effectively buying 1 share of Lion Electric.** \n\nLet me preface this post by saying that [Lion Electric](https://thelionelectric.com/en) has been working on their vehicles, battery technology, and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the [largest fleet of electified school buses](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:~:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.) on the road in North America as we speak. \n\n#[Here is the link to their investor presentation where they are already forecasting a positive EBITDA by the end of 2021.

No company outside of 'Murica or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits in Quebec are pretty fucking insane, but other than that you are right. The good thing is that it ain't gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in [Michigan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html) where it delivered the state's first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the [merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination) with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).\n\n\n\n#*So, why the FUCK should I care?* \n\n\n**Because fucking Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care, idiot.** \n\n\nNews silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on 'silently' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a PR team full of slimy fuckers. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). \n\n**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** \n\nAnd, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla's truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon's facilities, and most importantly they are already ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. [See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.](https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8)\n\n#*And what about Joe Biden?* \n\n**Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) over the next 4 years**\n\nNO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), [where the Co-chair of Biden's Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). Allow me to show you what the Lion Electric buses look like, and what their clients think of them, highlighted by [this dude](https://youtu.be/StpnGrItO4E?t=46) from California  labelling them as the **Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses**. \n\nI\u2019m sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? [A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not mention Lion in the peer comparison section, as they would've admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) \n\n\n**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion's revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra's entire revenue in 2025.**\n\nAnyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be shitting out school buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.\n\n\n\n#*Why should I buy RIGHT FUCKING NOW?*\n\n**Because tomorrow may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**\n\nJim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TOMORROW](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this shit fucking takes off. It is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going the pump the shit out of Lion tomorrow, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. \n\n**How do I know $NGA will pump so hard?** The CEO of Lion featured on a [local news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I'm sure none of you idiots understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy will send this shit to the moon and beyond \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a. \n\n**Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.**\n\n\n\n#*But why should I FUCKING pick Lion Electric over all the other EV stocks that get spammed here?*\n\n\n\n**Because Lion Electric offers much more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes**\n\n\n\n\u00b7 There are currently 7 different [trucks and buses](https://imgur.com/L1cu6oS) **available for purchase**\n\n\n\u00b7 They already have **300+ vehicles on the road** today with over \n  6mil miles between them \n\n\n\u00b7 Multi-year deal agreement for **Amazon** to purchase up to \n  2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger \n  and more lucrative opportunities afterwards\n\n\n\u00b7 **CN (huge Canadian transporter)** recently Purchased 50 \n  trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later\n\n\n\u00b7 **Government-backed**: [Canada's prime minister Justin \n  Trudeau supports the company](https://imgur.com/xoJ9Kze), \n  while nationalized companies like Hydro Quebec and SAQ have \n  purchase agreements in place that provide a strong foundation \n  for Lion's business\n\n\n\u00b7 **Produce their own batteries:** on top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is \n  building a facility to and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale \n  production, set to be completed in 2022\n\n\n\u00b7 **V2G technology** ready for the batteries, and implemented \n  into their school buses\n\n\n\u00b7 Deals with **BMW, ChargePoint, Nuvve, and Romeo Power**\n\n\n\u00b7 **[8 NEW vehicles](https://imgur.com/dFFTczt)** to be produced between 2021-2022 \n  including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks\n\n\u00b7 [USA expansion](https://imgur.com/wFbrle5) completed by \n  2022, will give them a **\"Made in America\"** image\n\n\n\u00b7 NKLA *obviously* had to [scrap their deal on the table with Republic Services](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/23/tech/nikola-garbage-truck- \n  canceled/index.html) to \n  provide them with up to **5000 garbage disposal trucks** just a \n  few weeks ago.

I am not ramping, I genuinely think this stock is a bargain.\n\n**DD**\n\nInternational EV manufacturers have enjoyed an incredible surge through 2020. TSLA is likely overvalued, NIO performance has slowed. There are likely to be a range of discrepancies in supporting industries where securities are undervalued. Undoubtedly, these industries will grow to meet the needs of EV manufacturers as governments set ambitious targets to halt the production of FF vehicles.\n\nRef 1: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425)\n\nRef 2: [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)\n\nAs manufacturing requirements for lithium rise (for EV li-ion batteries) demand is set to rise dramatically, and current supply is insufficient. As such, there are likely to be a range of lithium mining/exploration start-ups that will do astonishingly well in months and years to come, despite the fact lithium as a commodity has fallen in price. Moreover, as lithium is now in a dip, it is an excellent time to buy into the industry. Lithium Americas Corp &amp; others have already done well, but I'm looking to buy in far lower for a larger % return.\n\nRef 3: [https://www.ft.com/content/b9395e8c-9321-4351-b98d-a664b1e99b03?sharetype=blocked](https://www.ft.com/content/b9395e8c-9321-4351-b98d-a664b1e99b03?sharetype=blocked)\n\nRef 4: [https://twitter.com/KodalMinerals/status/1334435246872399873/photo/2](https://twitter.com/KodalMinerals/status/1334435246872399873/photo/2)\n\nI draw your attention to Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE AIM), a British firm headed by Aussie Bernard Aylward, who comes to the firm with high repute. KOD is a mining &amp; exploration company currently developing a project in Bougouni, Mali, with a whopping 350km\u00b2 of potential mining operations, expecting to haul ***1.94 million tonnes*** of lithium over 8 years, with an ***estimated 1.4bn revenue***. The company is currently sat at a **hilarious market cap of \u00a312m, trading at p0.01/share.** Cast that against the MCs of their competitors (probably 10x undervalued). The project is in large part funded by Suay Chin, an enormous player in the Chinese lithium market.\n\nSource 5: [https://kodalminerals.com/project/bougouni-lithium-project/overview-highlights/](https://kodalminerals.com/project/bougouni-lithium-project/overview-highlights/)\n\nSource 6: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg)\n\nIn my opinion, the current market valuation remains low as KOD awaits a mining permit from the Government of Mali, expected soon. I anticipate that as the permit is granted and project action begins, KOD will shoot. This is caveated by the fact the time to build the project will likely be in excess of a year, perhaps closer to two years - but the share price will hopefully grow once they gain publicity, at this point I would consider them relatively unknown.  They also hold gold mining permits in Mali and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire which will shore up the share price. Definitely worth a look at. \n\nDisclosure: I am in 295k KOD shares at p0.08.",

        "selftext": "*DISCALIMER: If you want to learn about this in more depth and want to verify my claims, this is a link of a TED conference from a seasoned enviromentalist who explains these issues in details (*[*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w)*), but for the purpose of wsb, I will keep this post nice and short and focus on what really matters: money. Also english is not my native language, so forgive any errors*\n\nIn the last few years there's been a lot of speculation around the shift to renewables. A lot of people are bullish on solar, wind an EVs and are very bearish on big oil companies. I'm going to explain to you why **the government(s) shift to \"clean energy\" and the recent oil crisis  is actually very bullish for big oil in the medium to long term**.\n\n# Renewables cannot exist without oil\n\nBasically as it turns out, **current tech for solar and wind sucks big time**, and it probably will for decades to come. Not only they are nowhere near as enviromentally sustainable as nuclear power (because they need lots of terrain,  use 20x more resources than nuclear fission power plants, and there are recycling issues), but most importantly, these green plants depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing, so **they can only run and produce energy about 30% of the time.** The key here is that there is no real efficient way (no, pumping and dumping water is not efficient) to have these plants running without coupling them with fossil fuel burning regular plants, beacuse otherwise the electric power grid would be a mess. **So the real reason that all these oil companies are fine with the government shifting to green energy is that, to run this utopia of solar panels, wind turbines, and EVs, you'll still need their oil**. In fact, these companies are the ones that are lobbying politicians (in particular democrats, in the US case), persuading it to pursue this \"green\" bullshit instead of going with real less harmful choice, which is regular old nuclear energy. \n\n# The 2020 oil price shock benefits BIG oil companies in the long run\n\nThe oil price disaster in march might cause a short term problem with oil companies, but **BIG oil companies rubbed their hands**. Maybe the small oil companies or the ones with lots of debt can face problems and go out of business, but **the GIANT with a healthy balance sheet can survive the crisis and have even more market share**. You have to think about this as if oil companies were coffee shops. During corona, many closed and never opened again becaus eof bankrupcty, so the ones that had lots of cash available before the big hit, the big players like Starbucks, will benefit when there is full or partail reopening of the economy.\n\n# Oil demand will not shrink that much\n\nIf people knew that **oil is not just used for powering engines**, they probably wouldn't have such a negative outlook on oil demand. Guys, oil is fucking used to build anything that is made out of **plastic**. Even to make some **medications** you need stuff that comes from oil. To get all the useless shit that the west buys from India and China, you'll still need oil to power **container ships** that sail the ocean. Once this corona shit is over, people will still buy plane tickets to go on vacation. Sure, maybe business trips will take a permanent hit and there be slightly less demand due to the transition to \"green\", BUT, as we said earlier, green still needs it .... and we are still not adressing the elephant in the room: there are massive **emerging markets economies** growing in the worild today, a lot of second and third world countries that will still rely on oil for their initial growth for decades. These countries will offset the loss of demand from developed nations. Shit, general commodities prices have been skyrocketing recently. You wanna jump on steel gang and not on oil gang? The only way oil prices fall from here is if OPEC shits the bed.\n\n# The play\n\nAs long as this obsession for and complete ignorance and denial on how to solve climate change continues, and as long as the goverments of the west are corrupt and cannot see that they need to boost nuclear power and public transportation instead of solar, wind and EVs, big oil companies with a heathy balance sheet will be fine in the next decade. **Many oil companies are trading at or below book value, with massive dividend yields**, it won't stay like this forever. Do yourself a favour and be long on **RDS, XOM, BP, TOT, CVX and maybe even the italian E**. Saw a lot of hedge funds buying **OXY** in the past few months for some reason. Either buy shares, and if you are a brave man use leverage. I wouldn't advise options on this one since we don't know when the catalyst for the rally will come, and one of the main points of the play is to get that juicy dividend. If you just need to use options, use LEAPS for the love of god. I expect a return of AT LEAST 20% on teh shares alone, maybe even a lot more.\n\n**TLDR: shift to solar and wind will actually benefit supermassive oil companies with healthy balance sheets that can weather the current crisis**",

        "selftext": "TLDR: I am long and bullish on AST Spacemobile (\u201cSpacemobile\u201d) which is merging with the SPAC $NPA.   The risks presented by this investment are, for me, heavily outweighed by many factors including: \n\u2022\t Two billionaires and a KKR Partner on Spacemobile\u2019s Board of Directors, indicating possible investment from private equity \n\u2022\tMassive investment from key technological partners like Vodafone, Samsung, Rakuten, AT&amp;T, American Tower, and others.\n\u2022\tDue diligence process during the transaction adding another layer of examination of Spacemobile\u2019s intellectual property, including patents \n\u2022\tExtremely conservative valuation NPA used to price the deal, allowing room for significant upside while the $10 floor minimizes pre-merger downside.  \n\nThere have been plenty of prior DD posts on NPA/Spacemobile, including [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/khpzpg/ast_spacemobile_npa_invest_in_the_mobile_space/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kn8rhg/some_deep_digging_on_npa_astscience_endtoend/).  My goal isn\u2019t to regurgitate the same information \u2013 if you want to know why Spacemobile doesn\u2019t compete with SpaceX, click the links \u2013 but to look through the preliminary [proxy](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1780312/000121390020044208/prem14a2020_newprovid.htm) filed by the company on December 23, 2020 to assess new and key information and apply that information to identified risks of investing in Spacemobile.   Here are my thoughts.\n\n\n**Key Learning #1**:  Spacemobile has a strong connection to KKR, the behemoth global investment and private equity firm.  \n\nOne of Spacemobile\u2019s post-merger Directors is Richard Sarnoff, a partner Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, otherwise known as KKR.   From his [bio](https://www.kkr.com/our-firm/leadership/richard-sarnoff):  \u201cRichard Sarnoff (New York) is Partner and Chairman of Media, Entertainment, and Education for KKR\u2019s Private Equity platform in the Americas, and serves as a member of the TMT growth equity investment committee. From 2014 through 2017, he served as Managing Director and Head of the Media and Communications industry group, leading investments in the Media, Telecom, Information Services, Digital Media and Education sectors in the US. \u201c\n\nThere\u2019s a lot there, so I want to break it down.  First, Sarnoff is a Partner at KKR, meaning that he is at the highest tiers of the firm \u2013 he\u2019s a heavyweight, not just some guy that works there.  Second, what is KKR\u2019s TMT private equity fund?  They describe it [here](https://media.kkr.com/news-details/?news_id=72baa1dc-1526-40db-a93c-b55c06b4474b) as \u201cfocused on generating strong returns for investors by investing in market-leading, high-growth companies.\u201d  Importantly, they also state that the fund \u201cseeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk.\u201d\n\nNow, we do not know whether KKR has directly invested in Spacemobile (they don\u2019t have disclosure obligations unless their ownership percentage is greater than 5%, I think) nor do we know that the TMT fund has invested.  But we do know that the person that was the head of the TMT fund for the Americas for and is still a member of the investment committee will sit on the Spacemobile board.  His presence makes it very possible that KKR has invested, though again that is not known.\n\nThere\u2019s another big reason why KKR\u2019s connection to Spacemobile matters: KKR has three very large investments in companies that provide mobile broadband.  Specifically:\n\u2022\tHivory: this is the the largest independent telecoms tower company in France and third largest European tower company.  KKR has a [49.99% stake](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181218005696/en/Altice-and-KKR-Announce-the-Creation-of-Hivory) in the company, which used its portfolio 10,000 cellular towers to \u201cpartner with all mobile operators to develop their coverage\u201d in France and \u201cseek to contribute to the development of French technology infrastructure and innovation, supporting telecom players on the eve of the \u2018New Deal\u2019 for French mobile and 5G roll out.\u201d  Basically, KKR has a huge mobile broadband investment in France/Europe.\n\u2022\tTelxius: KKR bought a 40% stake in Telxius in 2017 for 1.275 euros ($1.55 billion today).  Telxius [owns](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telefonica-m-a-kkr/telefonica-to-sell-up-to-40-percent-of-telxius-to-kkr-for-1-3-billion-euros-idUSKBN1600K8) and operates over 16,000 telecommunications towers in five countries.  , \n\u2022\tJio: Just in 2020, KKR [invested](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/kkr-invests-1-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/) $1.5 billion into a 2.32% stake in Reliance Jio Platforms, a top Indian telecom operator.   As the Techcrunch article notes, \u201cIndia has emerged as one of the biggest global battlegrounds for Silicon Valley and Chinese firms that are looking to win the nation\u2019s 1.3 billion people, most of whom remain without a smartphone and internet connection.\u201d  \n\n**Why this all matters**:  \n\u2022\tSarnoff\u2019s presence is a huge validation of the Spacemobile technology and business model.  People like Sarnoff with huge investment experience do not give their credibility to crappy, vaporware companies.  \n\u2022\tOne of the key risks I have seen discussed is that setbacks or delays could result in Spacemobile not having enough cash to fund Phase I.  KKR is a HUGE potential resource if additional financing is eventually needed.  \n\u2022\tPhase I for Spacemobile very likely includes India \u2013 see here \u2013 so KKR\u2019s presence on Spacemobile\u2019s board and investment into a massive Indian telecom means they have an already-existing connection to the incredibly large and lucrative Indian market not to mention Europe (through Hivory), and Latin America (through Telxius and Adrianan Cisneros).\n\n\n**Key Learning #2**: There are also multiple billionaires on the Spacemobile Board\n\n\n\u2022\t**Hiroshi \u201cMickey\u201d Mikitani**: he\u2019s the Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Rakuten, Inc.  He\u2019s worth about [$6 billion](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/102215/top-8-billionaires-living-japan.asp) and has a multi-billion dollar [investment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jsimms/2019/04/10/japans-richest-2019-hiroshi-mikitani-aims-to-disrupt-japans-telecom-industry-with-rakuten-mobile/?sh=3d24fe7a3a6d) into making Rakuten Mobile a dominant player in Japan.  Per the proxy, he\u2019s also going to remain a 15.5% shareholder post-merger (assuming no redemptions) and, like all insiders, has agreed to a one year lockup of his shares.\n\u2022\t**Adriana Cisneros**: CEO of the Cisneros Group, a privately-held media, entertainment, digital advertisement, and real estate.  According to Forbes, the Cisneros family is [worth](https://www.forbes.com/profile/gustavo-cisneros/?sh=79ba3283733d) over $1 billion.  Notably, the Cisneros group (led by Ms. Cisneros\u2019 father at the time) rolled out satellite television service DirecTV in Latin America in the 1990s.\n\n**Why this matters**: The presence of multiple billionaires tells me that Spacemobile has strong connections to liquidity if it\u2019s needed, and those players in turn have strong connections with financial institutions.  Spacemobile should be able to leverage those connections to raise debt (particularly in this low-interest environment) or use other means to facilitate financing if necessary.\n\n\n**Key Learning #3**: The diligence done in the transaction included a deep dive into Spacemobile\u2019s intellectual property\n\nSpacemobile believes that its 836 patent claims (as of December 1, 2020), which include proprietary and innovative satellite technologies, create a high barrier to entry and leave no competitors to Spacemobile.  The company itself has stated that it cannot publicly explain how the technology works or it would give away its competitive edge, which many potential investors (including myself) see as a significant risk.  \n\nHowever, we do know that NPA hired Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), one of the top law firms in the country, to do due diligence for the deal.  According to the proxy, that diligence included:\n\u2022\tReviewing documents in a \u201cvirtual data room\u201d including Spacemobile\u2019s intellectual property (patents)\n\u2022\tIntellectual property database searches\n\u2022\tConference calls with AST Spacemobile\u2019s management and NPA \u201cto discuss AST\u2019s patent portfolio in order to diligence AST\u2019s claims relative to AST\u2019s market competitors\u201d\n**Why this matters**:\n\u2022\tLawyers aren\u2019t scientists, but the fact that Spacemobile\u2019s patents were looked at closely by very smart people with various science degrees (as IP have lawyers) during diligence, in addition to the scientists at Vodafone/Rakuten/American Tower/Samsung NEXT, is another sign that the technology is legit\n\n\n**Key Learning #4**: The valuation used to price Spacemobile is VERY conservative\n\nBefore the deal was finalized, the NPA Board of Directors met and considered whether they should go forward with the merger.  Their entire thought process, including the benefits and risks they considered, are laid out in the proxy.  At the end of the meeting, \u201cit was the view of the Board that AST was an attractive target company and the proposed transaction contemplated a conservative valuation of AST.\u201d  Certainly a self-serving statement, but helpfully they laid out the exact comps they used to come to that conclusion for us to see.  In short, since \u201cno single company conducts business that is identical to AST,\u201d they compared Spacemobile to a bunch of different potential comparable business including:\n(i)\tsatellite (Iridium)\n(ii)\tspace tourism (Galactic)\n(iii)\ttelecom (T-Mobile, Verizon)\n(iv)\tcable (Altice, Charter Communications)\n(v)\ttowers (American Tower, Crown Castle, SBA) and \n(vi)\thigh growth SPACs (Hyliion, Lordstown, Desktop Metal and Luminar). \nThey then took the enterprise value of each of these companies and divided it by each company\u2019s projected 2021 EBITDA (or 2024/2025 EBITDA for space tourism and high-growth SPACs) to get an EBITDA multiple for each:\n\n**Company Name / Multiple**\nIridium Satellite LLC / 16.7x\nVirgin Galactic / 33.5x\nT-Mobile  8.3x \nVerizon / 7.3x\nAltice USA, Inc. / 9.8x\nCharter Communications, Inc.  / 11.8x\nAmerican Tower International, Inc.  / 21.7x\nCrown Castle International / 23.9x\nSBA Communications Corporation / 26.3x\nHyliion Holdings Corp. / 3.5x\nLordstown Motors Corp.  / 4.1x\nDesktop Metal, Inc.  / 13.3x\nLuminar Technologies, Inc.  / 24.4x\n\n\nThe deal here values Spacemobile at $1.4 billion (assuming $10/share price), meaning its projected $1.014 billion EBITDA in 2024 gives it a 1.4x multiple \u2013 substantially lower than all of these.  To me, **that is an EXTREMELY conservative valuation** and why I think this company and its share price is poised to substantially increase.  Moreover, NPA\u2019s board also noted that a 13-15x multiple, \u201cwhich NPA\u2019s management selected based on their professional experience and judgment,\u201d would give Spacemobile a value of somewhere between $7.6 and $8.8 billion.\n\n**Why this matters**:\n\u2022\tNPA\u2019s valuation at $10/share comes in drastically below every comp that was looked at by the NPA board and that exists.  If you use those multiples, NPA\u2019s share price should be $25 (Hyliion multiple) or $239 (Vergin Galactic).\n\u2022\tNPA\u2019s board considers 13-15x (and after an annual discount of 20%) to be the appropriate multiple for the industry, which would lead to a $7.6-$8.8 billion valuation.  That implies a share price of $54 to $62 (if my math is right).   \n\u2022\tPre-merger, there is a $10 floor to common shares of NPA.  So, with NPA closing today at $12.69 per share, there is a ~21% risk (assuming a fall all the way to $10, which is highly unlikely) for a return of somewhere between 2-5x.  I personally think that is a very favorable risk/reward scenario and expect the stock to climb substantially from now until the merger, expected in late February/early March.\n\nDisclosure: I am long 50k commons and 45k warrants",

        "selftext": "Gamma is a measure of risk for options, and reflects the rate of change in delta for a $1 change in the underlying asset price. In other words, gamma represents what happens to delta as the underlying asset moves. Because it represents the change in delta as the underlying price changes, Gamma can be used to determine the magnitude of movement in an options price for a corresponding movement in the underlying.  Gamma is an essential part of derivatives pricing, and is very useful when it comes to more complicated strategies of risk management. \n\nGamma is always positive for long options and negative for short options. This means all owners of options have positive gamma, regardless of being long or short the underlying asset. This also means that long option buyers benefit the most from gamma, as for every $1 movement in favor of the position, like a $1 increase for calls or a $1 decrease for puts, the opportunity for profit increases. This is because as gamma increases, so does delta, and meaning the profit per dollar increases as well. Furthermore, if the underlying asset moves against a position, like decreasing in price for calls or increasing in price for puts, gamma causes delta to decrease, causing lesser losses. \n\nAdditionally, like theta and delta, gamma varies based on an options strike price and expiration. Gamma increases as an option approaches expiration, and decreases as an option becomes deeper in or out the money. The closer the strike price is to the underlying asset price, the higher the gamma, meaning at the money options have the highest gamma. Gamma is highest when the option is at the money, and decreases as the asset price moves away from the strike price. \n\n**How is Gamma used?**\n\nGammas mainly used to analyze delta, as it shows how delta will change with different movements in the underlying asset price. This, in turn, allows for risk mitigation, as an options price can be analyzed for a variety of different situations. \n\nIn other words, by looking at  gamma, you can tell how much delta will change when the underlying asset\u2019s price changes, which allows for a rough estimate of an options price for different movements in the underlying. \n\nAdditionally, gamma can be used in more advanced methods of portfolio management. When delta hedging, gamma must be taken into account due to its impact on delta. As a quick reminder, delta hedging is a technique that minimizes delta so underlying price movement has little effect on a position. Delta neutral positions utilize this concept of delta hedging. Delta neutral positions have a delta close to 0 so underlying asset movement causes little change in the positions. This requires a neutral or near 0 gamma, which ensures the delta hedge remains effective even with more drastic price movement in the underlying asset. \n\n**An example with Gamma**\n\nLet's look at an example of gamma and its relation to delta.  If a call option has a delta of 0.25, and a gamma of 0.05, a $1 change in the underlying asset price will result in delta changing by 0.05 (which is the gamma value). As always, this is assuming no other factors change. If the underlying asset\u2019s  price increased by $1, the delta would go up to 0.30. Similarly, if the underlying asset price decreased by $1, the delta would go down to 0.20. As we discussed before, gamma is always a positive value. This can be confusing when it comes to options like long puts, so let's look at another example.  If a long put has a delta of -0.25 and a gamma of 0.05, then a $1 increase in underlying asset would cause the delta to go to -0.20, while a $1 decrease in underlying asset price would result in delta going to -0.3.\n\n**The math behind Gamma**\n\nWe know delta to be the first derivative of the option value V with respect to the underlying asset price S.\n\nAdditionally, we know that gamma represents the rate of change of delta with respect to changes in the underlying asset price. This means that gamma is the second derivative of the option value with respect to the underlying asset, and the first derivative of delta with respect to the underlying asset price. \n\n**Wider applications of Gamma**\n\nGamma helps represent the concept of convexity, which states that as the price of an underlying asset changes, the price of a derivative (like an option), does not change linearly. Instead, its change depends on the second derivative. \n\nIn mathematical terms, convexity represents the second derivative of the output price with respect to an input price, as does gamma in regard to derivative pricing. Convexity is most commonly used in reference to bond pricing and bond yields. \n\nConvexity = 1 / \\[bond price x (1+y)2\\]\u03a3\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Gamma represents the relationship between underlying asset price and delta. \n* Gamma varies depending on an options strike price and expiration, with at the money options and options closest to expiration having the highest gamma. \n* All long options have positive gamma, and all short options have negative gamma. \n* Gamma can be used to measure the magnitude of price movement for an option when the underlying asset changes, due to its relationship with delta.",

        "selftext": "Sup fellow degenerates? Are you curious about how the government is going to steal your tendies or, more likely, if all of the losses from your degenerate yolo trades can actually help you at all? Well lucky for you, Papa is here to provide a basic overview of the tax process in FAQ style. Fair warning, no DD here and there will be a *TL;DR* so you can now scroll and ignore my labor of love. *This is 100% not legal advice and is intended for general educational purposes.*\n\n***Section One: For those with tendies***\n\n**Q: What is tax?**\n\n**A:** Google it.\n\n**Q: What types of tax are associated with stonks?**\n\n**A:** While not an inclusive list, the traditional tax types you will run into will be: 1. Long Term Capital Gains (\u201cLTCG\u201d); 2. Short Term Capital Gains (\u201cSTCG\u201d); 3. Long Term Capital Loss (\u201cLTCL\u201d); 4. Short Term Capital Loss (\u201cSTCL\u201d) (*applicable to 99% of you*); and 5. Dividend tax treatment.\n\n**Q: What is the difference between long term or short term?**\n\n**A:** Gain/Loss is long term verses short term based on, you guessed it, the duration of time you owned the qualifying investment. Over twelve (12) months is long term and under twelve (12) months is short term.\n\n**Q: Is my option long term or short-term gain/loss?**\n\n**A:** You most likely trade FDs, it\u2019s short term. \\* Semi-joke, but unless you owned the option for over 12 months, *e.g.*, leaps, then it is short term.\n\n**Q: Why does long term v short term matter?**\n\n**A:** Simply put, long term gain receives more favorable tax treatment as policy rewards longer term investments. While LTCG is tax at 0-20% effective rate based on your individual income, STCG is treated as ordinary income and is taxed at whatever your effective rate is. Therefore, it is at a great advantage of someone with either large amount of gain (no one here) or high income (also no one here) to hold investments longer to receive LTCG tax treatment.\n\n**Q: How do dividends factor into this?**\n\n**A:** Depends, if your also invested into stonk occasionally certain stonk will pay out dividend payments. These dividends are either \u201cqualified\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d dividends. Without going in-depth into the corporate tax law, \u201cqualified\u201d dividends are treated at LTCG rate whereas ordinary dividends are treated as STCG = ordinary income.\n\n***Section Two: For those without tendies***\n\n**Q: I fucked up; can these losses be used for anything?**\n\n**A:** Thankfully the tax code knew people like us would inevitably try our hand at white collar gambling, and, unlike our degenerate sports betting cousins, the tax code has tax benefits for losses the first question is: do I have a net loss and, if yes, is my loss short term or long term? If you do have copious losses, good news they are deductible but there are limits.\n\n**Q: Ok, obviously I have losses\u2026 how do I deduct them?**\n\n**A:** Losses on your investments are first used to\u00a0offset capital gains\u00a0of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain. And finally, if you have more losses than total gain, you can utilize the losses deduct up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year.\n\n**Q: Bro, I yolo\u2019ed and have way more than $3,000 of losses, what now?**\n\n**A:** Luckily, or unluckily, you are allowed to carry forward the losses indefinitely utilizing $3,000 each future tax year until you\u2019ve expended the loss.\n\n**Q: What if I still have questions or need help with some other legal matter?**\n\n**A:** You should consult with a professional \\*cough cough\\*\n\n*TL;DR* **File your taxes and consult with tax professionals**. I represent taxpayers across the country before the IRS and several northeastern state tax authorities and would like to see as many of you avoid dealing with them.\n\nSource References: See Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7\u202f 1222; 1211; 1212; 316; etc. and please consult with tax and legal professionals.\n\nThe above is intended to provide generalized financial information designed to educate a broad segment of the public; it does not give personalized tax, investment, legal, or other business and professional advice.

        "selftext": "WARNING: 8TH GRADE READING LEVEL REQUIRED FOR MATERIAL\n\n# Intro/Disclaimer\n\nyeah its long as fuck, but read for tendies. If its too long suck a bear dick and move on. This is real analysis of the business model, not just a bunch of emojis. It is so long because of the niche field it is operating in and how a lot of key points are not understood well by the WSB community. This company really is a diamond in the rough and a great way to play future trends with less risk as you're not picking winners. Its the \"picks and shovels\" play of electrification and renewable energies. I'll explain the realistic case for how this company is soon going to be running the best tendie mine for decades to come.\n\nThis is my second DD post on now $MP, formerly $FVAC, and i'm back to discuss the developments of the company since my pre-merger post and add some further analysis about the valuation of the company and its future. **There has been too much really shitty DD** from both bulls and bears **on this company**where very few people on here have a real understanding of this company, their business model, and the future.\n\nFirst - read my original DD post in order to have a decent understanding of the backstory cause I'm not about to type out all that shit again or explain what I've already written. Read that first then come back:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac\\_dd\\_evchina\\_tension\\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac_dd_evchina_tension_play/)\n\nThat post discusses mainly international tensions and the role REE's but this one i'll speak more on the business case of this company and how even without geopolitical tensions it is a true tendie mine.\n\nSecond - no I'm not a bag holder Ive been in since it was a pre-merged SPAC my average on my shares is about $14 and my LEAP is far far ITM and no I'm not selling any of them. Also, as i referenced in the post I work in a very similar field and interned in college at a mineral mine in the refining aspect as a chemical engineer, so while I'm not an expert at this I have more insight than the average retard and I am trying to give out tendies before the boomers take them from us. I will try my best to explain the business model of a mining company and why this company is the most unique and interesting way to get tech company level growth with the associated free cash flow while not having to be anywhere near as innovative. Ill discuss a lot of the bear arguments for this company as well and try to de-bunk them as most don't really hold water once you look into them the slightest bit.\n\n# Background of NdPr\n\nWhile the company produces as basket of Rare Earth, the plant is aiming to focus on NdPr and other permanent magnet materials in order to play the trend of EV's and electrification. These magnets are extremely important for so many technologies due to how Electric motors work. To put it simply, at current technology the only way to convert electricity to motion or the only way to convert motion to electricity relies on permanent magnets. Im not gonna try to explain more than that because I too am retarded but if you don't believe me or want to learn how watch this  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWulQ1ZSE3c):\n\nyeah i know you didn't watch that video, but just imagine you did and now believe me.\n\nHowever, because it works both ways BOTH electric motors AND electric generators rely on this technology. This is key for understanding how NdPr is the best way to play both the trends of electrification AND renewables. First, electrification is most embodied by the rise in EV's in the future, and while that is predicted to be the fastest growing segment of NdPr demand it is foolish to not to account for other evolving technologies reliant on electric motors as well. Robotics will be a huge growth market and electrification of other industries will rely on NdPr permanent magnets. The other massive growth opportunity for permanent magnets is through renewable energies. Wind energy (and possible future motion based energy harvesting tech like tidal energy) work through harvesting mechanical motion and turning a generator to create electricity. Wind power doesn't work without electric generators which don't work without magnets. In addition, wind tech is advancing down a path to require even more magnets due to improvements is Permanent Magnet Direct-Drive (PMDD) technology from the current Gearbox doubly-fed induction Generator (DFIG). Essentially what that means is the new technology will take out the gearbox currently used in wind mills and replacing them with more efficient direct driving technology allowing more mechanical motion into electricity. These new generators require stronger magnets, thus more magnetic material. Read more about that [here](https://www.goldwindamericas.com/pmdd):\n\n**TLDR**: They mine mainly permanent magnet materials that at current scientific understanding CANNOT be replaced due to their unique electromagnetic properties.\n\n**TLDR on the TLDR**: Special Rocks no replacing. Need special rocks.\n\n# $MP's expansion plans\n\nA lot of bears like to bring up the fact that $MP is still reliant on China to do their refining and they're correct... for now. Currently they mine on site and refine to REE concentrates which they then send to china to refine into Rare Earth Oxides (REO's), which then get send to become metal alloys and then finally to magnets. Currently is the only location in the world to refine past concentrate material so $MP is forced to send their material there, but that is why the went public. The intent of them going public was to raise funds in order build an on-site REO facitility, which is scheduled for completion in 2022 and is already started. They already have enough cash on hand to furnish this upgrade as they had over $500M on hand at the end of Q3, and they also are a cash flow positive company already before even moving downstream. There are EV infrastructure plays with much worse valuations and years away from breaking even on cash flow, yes I'm talking to you $QS bagholders... that tech is unproven and there are so many battery competitors in a field where there WILL be a winner\n\nWhy would they want to move downstream when they're already profitable??? Because the further downstream they go the higher margins they earn and the more tendies they can mine for us. Refining raw materials to useful materials is a value adding process and thus creates more value for the company that does it. Once they complete this expansion they plan on going to stage 3 of their business model, the ability to build magnets and other final products of REE's in America. They have not decided/disclosed their plans for this, whether it is through construction of an onsite facility, an acquisition, or a joint venture, but it is in the plans. This is expected to come online around 2025 and when the insane cash flow can begin for the company. I don't have any reason to doubt the validity of their intention as its just a continuation of the business model they are currently implementing and the majority of the corporate rhetoric is related to \"mine-to-magnet\" and \"restoring the REE supply chain to America.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for the company? as they move further and further downstream they will increase their margins from this action alone, but it gets even better. This can be shown in their in-house calculations of their 2023 adj. EBITDA target of $252M\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 7eiobfp84f961...*\n\nit is important to note that those numbers are from the current step they are taking right now in building the REO refining facility. Adding further downstream capabilities will only cause that EBITDA value to grow as margins improve, but next I'll discuss where their margins will improve from EVEN MORE.\n\n**TLDR**: downstream expansion is a way to increase margins and therefore free cash flow for the company.\n\n**TLDR of TLDR**: Special rock get more special. Get more tendies for special rock.\n\n# Business model of mining companies and why $MP has insane growth potential\n\n*\\*\\*\\*This is the most important part of this long ass post, if you read one section, then read this\\*\\**\n\nA big disconnect on a lot of DD in this sub and analysis elsewhere is the economics of how a mining company works. A mine is by definition a COMMODITY PLAY, which I know is not as exciting as a tech company, BUT it will experience tech sector growth for a period of time and then experience a period of time in which develop into a cash cow business reaping huge dividends for shareholders.\n\nWhat i mean by a commodity play is through the economics of how a mine operates. Given a mine at a fixed production volume, the costs on a year in year out basis are relatively similar. What i mean by this is the cost $MP to mine and refine into concentrate will be the same no matter the price of their product. However, the revenue they receive is dependent on the market price of their product, which is what varies the most. An easy way to describe this is through taking a look at their Q3 2020 financial results presentation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ijzcpgmc4f961...*\n\nThat value of Production cost (at the current stage of just creating REE concentrates) will realistically stay the same as that value is from the cost of labor, energy for machinery, administrative costs, etc. While these numbers will vary from quarter to quarter these are costs not predicted to experience rapid growth and this is what is important to realize. It costs roughly the same amount of money to pay someone to blast ore, dig it into dump trucks, pay operators to refine into ore, etc. Don't trust me, look into how steel companies operate, like this sub's favorite $MT. The revenue they receive is dependent on the price of REE's, which is NOT PREDICTED TO BE FLAT. Here is the historic graph of Neodymium from 2011-current:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q1ytv5ch4f961...*\n\n\\*\\*If you are an investor in $MP (which you should be) this is an important website to pay attention to because understanding the market dynamics of their product is important to understanding the valuation of this company. \\*\\*\n\nAllow me to disect that graph a little bit:\n\n1st Peak: From the aftermath of the supply shock from 2010/2011 from the Japanese Navy and Chinese fisherman story i discusses in my previous $FVAC post i linked above. China lowered exports by 40% and the price shot up drastically as industries across the world tried to gobble up as much NdPr as fast as possible in order to ensure their production lines. That was then followed by china flooding the market and selling back that backlog. that caused prices to fall off a cliff and ended up taking molyorp out of business. I'll discuss the Molycorp saga later more in depth and the differences of them and $MP.\n\n2nd Peak: This peak (late 2017) is from the Trade war trump caused with china and is another good explanation of the correlation between REE's and geopolitics i discussed in my last DD post. The middle 2019 peak is again the trade war heating up again.\n\n3rd peak: where we are now. This is from the increased tailwind of EV adoption, more from asia and Europe than the US **and** because china has been threatening to use REE's as a political tool again, which again i referenced more in my last DD post.\n\nHowever going forward if you want to predict the amount of revenue MP will earn its important to understand the market dynamic and I'd like to discuss why the price is geopolitics aside predicted to steadily increase at a very fast rate. MP, like any other commodity play, relies on the supply-demand dynamic of the sector, and REE demand growth is on track to far outstrip the supply growth. This will result increased prices per ton, but MP's costs stay the same. This is the beauty of the company, as the price goes up their margins go up too! MP and market analysts predicted over a 100% growth in NdPr magnets in the next 10 years:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img v0ta2r1l4f961...*\n\nDon't believe that metric? check this more in depth one:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 7kjnncgn4f961...*\n\nThis graph shows most important metric as it shows that the world at current rate is not scaling up to meet demand. THIS GRAPH INCLUDES CURRENT PLANNED EXPANSIONS INCLUDING INCREASED RECYCLING. What does this mean?? There is a huge mismatch in projected demand and supply and if you don't know what that will mean then ask your wife's boyfriend about supply-demand graphs from their economics class. The result will be massively increased prices of permanent magnet materials because the world will not be able to mine and refine enough to satisfy demand, so they will be able to increase their prices. BUT AS I SAID EARLIER, MP'S COSTS PER TON WILL REMAIN THE SAME. So what is the gist of this coupled with MP moving toward downstream expansion? MP's margins will increase incredibly from a double whammy of moving downstream AND supply-demand imbalance. Now what does that mean for you?? that means $MP has a very realistic and conservative path toward becoming a company with RIDICULOUS free cash flow.\n\nWhat does that mean for MP? That means that the company will be raking in cash and will be extremely flexible due to their balance sheet. They will be able to expand operations or acquire competitors in order to increase their market share and production volumes OR they will be able to transition into a boomer dividend company that will pay you tendies each year. They could do either of those very easily because the company HAS NO DEBT. In fact, $MP ended Q3 2020 with $507M CASH on hand to finance their future expansions. Okay, i know dividends are boring but the market will begin to price in that future dividend potential and give your calls many tendies along the path to pricing in their dividend power.\n\n**TLDR**: Supply demand imbalance (with geopolitical tensions as a wild card) will result in insane free cash flow in the future for this company.\n\n**TLDR of the TLDR**: People want more special rock more than can make special rock. People give you more tendies for special rocks.\n\n# Why Supply won't be able to scale up as fast\n\nA very important assumption in my analysis is the inability for supply to scale up as fast as demand and I'd like to explain this more in depth as it is the crux of this DD. This is where my experience in mineral refining is valuable as I can weigh in on this aspect. Over time there will be more suppliers that come into the business and we are seeing that already, however this is where the timetables of that come into play. Simply put supply can't go up because companies will be slowed greatly due to the time it will take to get up and running and the incredible amount of upfront capital needed before even starting up the mine. If a company is interested in getting into the field there isn't a fast path in because the companies can't just decide to go into the business and then go to the \"REE refining machinery store\" and buy the equipment and have them get set up. All the machinery in chemical manufacturing plants (REE refining counts as chemical engineering so hear me out) has a long path in order to reach the optimum design. Ill outline the gist of this here:\n\n1. Lab Scale Testing: This is laboratory scale testing in which very small batches are prepared testing different procedures and methods in order to find the optimum refining process for the goals of the operation. This is when the deciding of the catalysts, solvents, additive chemicals, etc is done in order to decide **what to do** to the ore to get the best product.\n2. Pilot Plant Design and Testing: This step in the design process is designing and building a small scale model of machinery to run the process decided upon in lab scale testing in order to determine different operating conditions, determine control points, etc. This is when different tests and procedures are determined and also a proof of concept to begin economic calculations for designing the next step.\n3. Full scale design and building: This is when the full size, real-deal machinery is designed and constructed. But again, there is not \"REE refining manufacturing store\" to get much of this machinery. Refining plants are custom designed (minus certain machinery like pumps and basic ass shit like that) and custom built. These are custom designed, custom fabricated large scale machinery designed in every aspect from material, area, volume, and depth in order to lower manufacturing costs while also allowing for 24/7 continuous operation. The 24/7 operation aspect is important because it is why the machinery is designed so meticulously. The most economic operations are ones that require little down time and little maintenance and a lot of work is put in to optimize this aspect. That means it takes even more time to produce.\n4. Permitting and Certification: Now at this point the company is years into the development of REE refining, but they still can't start operating despite the entire operation up and running. In the US, now the lovely and very fast government gets to come in. Mining and refining operations don't operate under OSHA rules and procedures, they get to operate under OSHA's much meaner, expensive, and safety prone brother, the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Government inspectors have to come in and permit and certify EVERY PIECE OF MACHINERY, inspect every single moving part and permit them, and do a shit ton of other stuff for the government to allow you to begin operations. Now due to the stimulus bill's provisions toward stimulating REE capabilities in the United states I assume that MSHA will be (or already has been) told to prioritize REE companies and they will probably be fast tracked, but even fast tracking them will take a lot of time. In addition EPA has to come in and sign off on the environmental plans of the company and probably even more government entities will have to come in to sign off on stuff that was past my exposure when I interned in the field.\n\nNow you've seen how long it would take to get up and running, but another constraint worth mentioning is who does these? Larger Chemical or mining companies (Dow, DuPont, Chemours, BASF, etc) looking to enter the field probably have their own design teams that would be able to do it in house. Smaller, non-conglomerate entities would have to hire a chemical engineering design/consulting firm to come in and do the designing, write the procedures, and train the production engineers and operators. That means there is some decent intellectual constraints as to how many people have the know-how to design at the rate needed to scale up.\n\n**Here is what is important,** any entity trying to enter the sector will have enormous upfront costs in buying the land, designing the plant, buying the machinery like excavators, dump trucks, pipelines, pay employees well before starting due to training on the machinery. Im not sure the exact amounts of money needed but it would easily be in the 100s of millions at least. Then once all that upfront capital is sourced, plant designed, people trained, etc the operation would take YEARS to get out of all that debt and achieve meaningful positive cash flow. It is only a matter of time for $MP to have significant domestic competition, but by the time these operations could begin operating $MP will be so far ahead in production and have a significantly stronger balance sheet than these companies could have. **$MP will remain years ahead of any other domestic competitors**, even though competition will come.\n\n**TLDR**: At current outlook supply growth won't match demand growth and even if more competitors pop up to compete it'll take years to start operating and even more years to match $MP's ability.\n\n**TLDR on the TLDR**: Not enough people finding special rock. More people want special rock than can get special rock. They pay more for special rock.\n\n# $MP's competitors, both domestic and international\n\nA large argument that bears like to make is that competition is coming in the US, and they are 100% correct.... but it won't matter because AGAIN this is a commodity play, not a tech company. They make magnets, their revenue will depend on the price of their product. Buyers from this are not looking at $MP like you would look at $TSLA vs. $NIO or apple vs android where you could argue one is better than the other or consumers will adopt one over the other. There isn't brand recognition, increased utility, or consumer favorites in magnets, they're fucking magnets. Think about it like another commodity, lumber. If you go to $HD to buy some wood you aren't staring at two different planks of the same type of tree and picking one because of which timber company felled it or which milling company milled it. You just buy lumber and go home because it is wood. A timber company isn't outright threatened by another timber company popping up, as long as the demand-supply dynamic in the market stays the same the first timber company is unaffected. That is why it won't matter WHEN more domestic and international competitors pop up. As long as demand outstrips supply then commodity companies will make more and more money. Now I am not trying to bullshit people so I'll discuss the international and domestic competition, but Ill explain more in depth why i don't give a shit about them.\n\nDomestic: The ticker that cannot be named due to it being banned. If you take a look at that company it is a Uranium producer that is going to re-purpose machinery onsite from uranium production to REE production and they have successfully done pilot plant level processing. However if you analyze their production numbers you'll see that the scale they plan on producing is not quite at the level $MP will. They plan on refining 15,000 tons of ore per year with an estimated 55% REE concentration, which leaves an estimated 8,250 tons of REE per year, of which 22% is NdP (all their numbers not mine), which leaves annual production of 1,815 tons/yr. These numbers are pretty good and I do own a stake in this company because I like the potential, but its scale is not quite the scale of $MP. $MP is predicting a run rate of 6,075 tons/yr of NdPr, so yes the banned ticker is a decent competitor but its only predicting to be 1/3 the size of $MP annual production volume. A downside of the banned ticker is that they still are focusing on Uranium production so its not a pure REE play, but Uranium has a pretty decent bull case for the future so i don't want to slander that ticker too much. However, again, these are commodity plays, $MP having competition, even domestic, doest really affect their business plans or bull case. Additionally, the banned ticker is sourcing its ore rom Chemours' location in GA, but getting milled in Utah, so this is a long term inefficiency to consider as well that $MP won't have to worry about once their stage 2 REO mill is complete. the banned tickers financial health is pretty decent, but its market cap is $516M at close 1/4 which is just slightly above amount of cash on hand $MP had at the end of Q3 2020, $502M. That company is more of an investment opportunity than a competitor, if its even worth investing in.\n\nOther emerging domestic competitors: [link to article explaining them all](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-rareearths-projects-factbox/factbox-rare-earths-projects-under-development-in-u-s-idUSKCN2241L6) Im not going to go deep into each one but you can see that many are slowed down to the process I explained above about how expensive and time consuming it is to reach operational status. These companies will be coming online, but won't be profitable for a while and won't be able to provide the same returns to investors for even longer.\n\nInternational competitors: Lynas Corp. This is an Australian mining company that has also received pentagon funds to improve the non-China production capacity. They trade over the counter and are a real deal competitor and also worth investing in but their growth potential isn't as clear or easy as in the US. They have pentagon funding more so out of desperation by the pentagon to get more production in the western world than loving to invest in an Australian company. In the future I would imagine a lot of this government support will go toward US based companies.\n\nInternational competitors: all the china ones. yes they produce the largest amount of material in the world and do it the cheapest but this is the result of none to very little environmental protection. Once the supply chain can go \"mine to magnet\" many companies will look to diminish their exposure to chinese companies to ensure their supply chains are not at the whims of the Chinese government. In addition, $MP is the cleanest REE mine in the world and a lot of environmentally conscious companies will want to support clean mined REE's and once domestic production is high enough there could be regulations passed to further incentivize purchasing domestically produced REE's.\n\n**All these companies were included in the forecast of supply in 2030. Even with these companies coming online $MP is still positioned for incredible returns.**\n\n**TLDR**: Yes competition is coming, but there is already competition. Its also a commodity play so its not facing replacement or redundancy like many other growth markets\n\n**TLDR on the TLDR**: Others find special rock. Your special rock still worth many tendies. You still get many tendies.\n\n# Why this is NOT molycorp 2.0\n\nThe most common point of argument against this company is that people bring up the fact that the mine $MP operates used to be run by Molycorp, which went bankrupt. However if you read into that transaction it really isn't that scary. Molycorp did go under but this was in a period of price instability and they were not running as good of an operation. Molycorp operated during the 2010-2011 peak of REE's when china restricted supply. Molycorp stock went up a ton in addition to their revenue and thus they decided to invest in milling capabilities to create REO's (I know this is $MP's plan but don't get scared yet). Because of US EPA restrictions it was wildly expensive and at bankruptcy they had $1.7B in investments into capital projects to improve their refining capability, but the subsequent REE price collapse when china \"turned the taps back on\" to the world supply caused them to not afford operation. The site then changed hands back and forth until it was [bought by $MP's current management for $40M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molycorp). They then invested in it after literally buying for less than pennies on the dollar and got it up and running more efficiently than before. Last quarter Q3 2020 they ran 3.2x the REE concentrate production volume than Molycorp ever did:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s25.q4cdn.com\\/570172628\\/files\\/doc\\_financials\\/2020\\/q3\\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/c53c5a8w4f961.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d9f65cad202807588fe516b399ca954cef08a)\n\nThey got to buy over $1.7B worth of investments for $40M and have proven they have turned those investments into operating profit. In addition, previous operations prioritized Cerium production for FCC catalysts. $MP has transitioned the goal product to be NdPr as it has much better growth potential to give it long term possibility. In addition, the market climate Molycorp operated under was not as forgiving as now. Back then there wasn't the tailwind of increasing EV adoption, or the rise of other high tech growth sector reliant on REE's. Molycorp was too early and inefficient to win in the market and didn't have anywhere close to the amount of governmental support for the industry. There is bipartisan support on all levels, i mentioned this a bit in my last DD post, but since then - and this is big and shows the scale of gov support- [THE LAST STIMULUS BILL HAD $800M IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING DOMESTIC REE PRODUCTION](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/miners-laud-800m-rare-earth-fund-in-omnibus-bill-61939620)! Molycorp didn't have anywhere close to this level of government support. And again, the pentagon invested $9M into $MP to help fund their REO mill because the pentagon views the ability to refine REO's as a matter of national security.\n\n# Discussing Concerns about Biden Presidency\n\nPeople who say this shit clearly have no idea what they are talking about. Biden (or his puppet masters but who cares money is all green) has said he supports REE mining multiple times [source](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B). His team knows their big environmental initiatives rely on REE production and that domestic production is important to keep American industry at the whims of China. Yeah Trump was more hawkish with china but lets not act like a democratic presidency is going to let china walk all over the US or that Biden and other democrats will stop their push for EV's and clean energy. REE's are a cornerstone piece to so many of Biden's plans there is no way he turns his back on this company.\n\n# Discussion of Shenghe Resources and China and their relationships with $MP\n\nThe one real concern that people have is their partnership with Shenghe Resources where Shenghe has agreed to buy all $MP concentrate through 2021 and shenghe is a stakeholder in $MP. Many view this as a negative, but i think it should be seen as a good way to ensure survival in the gap between now and the final magnet production. A big issue would be if China chose to stop importing the MP concentrate, which would give MP no customers. Since this would adversely affect Shenge it makes it less likely and also the fact that MP produces 15% of the world's REE concentrate it would hurt the supply in china, which is huge. In fact, China removed their 25% tariff on importing REE material, read this [source](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2104418-china-to-remove-import-tariff-on-us-rare-earth-ores) as it also shows how china is buying up all the concentrate they can. Japan has the capability to go from REO to NdPr magnet as well so if china ends up fucking MP, starting in 2022 when their REO site is in operation then they will be able to sell their REO to Japanese companies to bridge the gap before they have their own magnet making capability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s25.q4cdn.com\\/570172628\\/files\\/doc\\_financials\\/2020\\/q3\\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/fnvxv8415f961.png?width=2494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a5db04a13d3e1c32d0f20de57b0f291e5b841a)\n\nChina is not likely to fuck MP and stop buying their concentrate as it will hurt china's wallet and ability to produce goods while only increasing the US government support for going mine to magnet domestically. China realistically views their dominance as ending at some point now, but they know they will still be able to control the market because of their scale regardless of whether they buy MP concentrates or not.\n\nAlso, if Shenghe doesn't buy their concentrates then they forfeit their stake in MP. they wouldn't be allowed to sell them on the market, the shares would just disappear, so it would effectively be a massive stock buyback and as long as the REO mill is complete then they just sell to Japanese magnet makers.\n\n# Mine Life discussion\n\nTheir S-1 states that at current proven reserves they have about 47 years of mine life left. That can be grown from drilling and exploration of more mineable material, which they stated they plan on doing. in addition, if they for some reason don't find more mineable ore on their land and don't buy more land with ore, then they could simply refine ore from other mines as the real cost barrier isn't the digging out of the ground, it is the milling.\n\n# TLDR\n\n$MP will to the moon over the next few years.\n\nPostions: shares for virgins and LEAPs for chads.",

However, you don\u2019t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein\u2019s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I\u2019ll tell you how.\n\n\n**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [\u201cThe Path to Palantir\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more \u201cartificial\u201d than \u201cintelligent.\u201d Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human\u2019s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to qualify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computer\u2019s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. \n\n\n**Software &amp; Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**\n\n\nHeres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you haven\u2019t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesn\u2019t you stay out past 8 PM, even when she\u2019s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, he\u2019s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computer\u2019s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parent\u2019s basement, but that won\u2019t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, \u201cfour in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.\u201d](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but i\u2019d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.\n\n\nEssentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it\u2019s \u201cacquisition contract\u201d stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they don\u2019t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they haven\u2019t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. \n\n\nRemember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually.

By 2019 SpaceX had filed for 42,000 satellites but are accused of trying \u201cto drown the ITU in studies so they can go ahead and operate Starlink under FCC sharing rules while ignoring the ITU first to file rules\u201d ([https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968](https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968)) At this point I believe that funding methods were being discussed and the possibility of a Starlink spin off was proposed. \n\nFebruary 6, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell expresses this sentiment at the JP Morgan event. I think it was still only speculative and Musk would basically refute this March 9 at the Satellite 2020 conference saying he was thinking about it \u201czero\u201d. In August SpaceX reported raising $1.9 billion in private funding. This plus funding series J though M equals around $3.2 billion.([https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds](https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds)) \n\nBy the end of September Musk tweeted \"We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.\"\n\nDid something occur between March and September that changed zero to probably? Bill Ackman\u2019s SPAC Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH) IPOs July 22. A blank check company with $5-7 billion to spend, specific acquisition requirements, and marketed as \u201cthe most investor friendly SPAC in the world.\u201d Despite no announced target, there are substantial investments by Guggenheim, Baupost, Soroban, etc. ([https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional))\n\nIn October, Momentus announced it will go public through a reverse merger with Stable Road. Their partnership with SpaceX and backing by Prime Movers Lab establishes a tenuous connection between Musk and Ackman as well as aligning interests.\n\nIn December, after reports that SpaceX was seeking funding to double its valuation to $92 billion, Musk coyly responds \u201cIncorrect.\u201d The following day u/Mobiledead posts a screenshot of Bill Ackman following SpaceX on Twitter. \n\nWhen I read the PSTH=SpaceX speculation I wrote it off as being as likely as Subway or Pornhub. But when I looked into the timeline of the various threads, there were some stars that seemed to align for Starlink. Bill Ackman was offering the right amount to help complete Starlink\u2019s constellation. The $5-7 billion could fit the 10-20% minority share he intended to acquire with the SPAC depending on how much of SpaceX's valuation is derived from Starlink. Ackman would take the largest SPAC to date and bring internet connection to the entire world cementing his legacy as an investor and an activist. Musk would be able to stop funneling money from his true passion with SpaceX, the Mars mission. And most importantly even small retail investors would see astronomical returns. \n\nThe main argument against Starlink, in my opinion, is Musk\u2019s prediction of an IPO several years in the future and his tweet cautioning investors about SPACs. ([https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009)) My counterargument: He says a lot of shit on Twitter. Although Starlink does not fit every acquisition criteria, we know Ackman was in talks with AirBnB at one point and they are missing some of the acquisition criteria as well. I don't think that Starlink is the most likely candidate for PSTH but I no longer think that it is entirely impossible. This is purely speculation and I'm sure there are things I've missed. If there's something I'm misunderstanding feel free to correct me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR  PSTH = Stripe",

Musk predicts that by the end of the year, Tesla's cars will be able to navigate both surface streets and freeways, allowing them to drive between any two points without human input.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, the cars will be \"feature complete,\" in Musk's terminology, but will still need a human driver to monitor the vehicle and intervene in the case of a malfunction. But Musk predicts it will only take about six more months for the software to become reliable enough to no longer require human supervision. By the end of 2020, Musk expects Tesla to have thousands of Tesla vehicles providing driverless rides to people in an Uber-style taxi service.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, Musk seems to believe that once Tesla's cars become \"feature complete\" later this year, they will be 90 percent of the way to full autonomy.

        "selftext": "tl;dr: buy ACES, TAN and ICLN July calls at any strike, and/or buy shares. Dem trifecta will force these up bigly\n\nThese tickers have nothing to do with clean energy, the underlying technologies or companies and everything to do with political situation in the US.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9z54wmj9xa61.png?width=868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b05e63aae5750ba75bd9485d58ad49135f337d8\n\nIf we take a look at ICLN\u2019s historical chart, it appears to have peaked in 2008! But how is this possible, I thought clean energy was invented in 2015 you say?? You see, in June of 2008 the a barrel of [West Texas Intermediate](https://imgur.com/a/jIggkVb) (WTI) spiked up to $147 and then down to $32 in December 2008.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[WTI \\($\\/barrel, not adjusted for inflation\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b035d7440b567a06b2c5e2385c63eb7e1ccaa81b)\n\n## The Oil Crisis of 2008\n\nSomeone could do a whole write-up on that topic, but basically, oil supply and demand curves are highly inelastic. If oil supplier A is blown up in a terrorist attack or nationalized in a socialist revolution, oil supplier B can\u2019t just drill a new well immediately. That\u2019s basically what happened in 2008, due to the political situations in several different countries in a short time period, oil production was severely disrupted and with increasing demand, this caused the spot price to soar.\n\nCoincidentally, BlackRock offered ICLN to the public for the first time in June of 2008, at the peak of the oil spike at $50/share. With the spot price of oil at insane levels, talk of \u201cpeak oil\u201d in the zeitgeist, democrats talking about addressing climate change head on with a cap-and-trade bill, investors suddenly were dreaming of the post-oil future. There was a lot of interest in investing in green energy companies. Who wouldn\u2019t want to buy shares in Chevron in 1897, right?\n\nWell, unfortunately for the retards that gobbled up whatever BlackRock was peddling, June 2008 was a bad time to go long on any security, as Lehman Brothers would file for bankruptcy in September which would create a global recession and swift fall in oil prices as demand plummets during recessions. With a barrel of oil cheaper once again cheaper than a keg of bud lite, green energy stocks plummeted.\n\n# Climate Change\n\nIn case you were eating crayons in grade school,  you see, carbon emissions are heating up the planet and it\u2019s creating an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires, severe snowstorms, tropical storms and the like. Even if you don\u2019t give a shit the polar bears or Australia\u2019s tourism industry or Florida, the extreme weather events are not ideal.\n\nSo let\u2019s solve climate change then? There is a big problem though. Actually solving climate change has this unfortunate effect of reducing the viability of companies in the O&amp;G sector, which means if passed, O&amp;G workers will lose their jobs.\n\nDoubly unfortunate for the democrats, O&amp;G workers are concentrated in a bunch of swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas etc. These states have entire cities where the local economy is entirely dependent on O&amp;G companies.\n\nYour average democratic primary voter though, does not live in one of those cities. Their general attitude can be (somewhat unfairly) boiled down to \u201cwe have to do this thing that\u2019s morally important to me, and we have to make some sacrifices, and you will have to lose your job and I will keep mine, but we have to make sacrifices, or the world will LITERALLY end by 2040.\u201d\n\n# The cap-and-trade bill of 2009\n\nThere is a quite straightforward solution to climate change: cap-and-trade. The idea is that every year government will offer permits to emit X tons of CO2 and sell these to the highest bidder. These will then be tradable assets. So it\u2019s a market based system, where the price of the permits directly reduce the competitiveness of fossil fuels when zero-carbon energy is also available.\n\nSo in 2009, Obama admin with Senate democrats came out with this plan to fix climate change, known as the [\u201cCap-and-Trade Bill\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act).\n\nCap-and-Trade was immediately unpopular among Americans, republicans and blue dog democrats seized on the opportunity to shit on Obama for his job-killing tree-hugging agenda, with hilarious ads such as this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&amp;v=xIJORBRpOPM&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&amp;v=xIJORBRpOPM&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nAs you can see in the ad, Joe Manchin eventually killed the cap-and-trade bill and West Virginia\u2019s coal industry was revived (no it wasn\u2019t, because coal isn\u2019t competitive with O&amp;G anymore).\n\nFrom here on out, a rift emerged amongst democrats and republicans, because the liberal democratic party primary voters DEMAND action on climate change while the electoral college and the senate punish action on climate change. So the issue these days is more polarized than abortion (actually).\n\n# Biden\u2019s Energy plan\n\nNow, the environment &amp; healthcare were and continue to be the top issues for the democratic base, including its most active voices. Biden may have lost some of these voters in the primary, but he brought them into his coalition in the general and won the white house.\n\nBasically Biden needs to throw some ~~red meat~~ vegan burger patties at the base.\n\nNow, Green New Deal doesn\u2019t include any mention of a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, I assume, because socialists hate market-based solutions that actually work. Instead it asks for a $100T in infrastructure spending.\n\nWith Joe Manchin still in the Senate, locked &amp; loaded ready to shoot cap-and-trade again, that\u2019s not happening anyway.\n\nBut as it happens, this green infrastructure spending isn\u2019t such a bad idea. Because infrastructure spending is popular across the aisle. It creates jobs, and does not directly destroy O&amp;G jobs. As we saw this year, the treasury can just sell trillions of bonds with no downside and JPOW will happily exchange them for real dollars.\n\nAnd the end goal of Democrats is to try to use that money to get a bunch of people in the Sunbelt and Texas employed in green energy, as an electoral counterweight to everyone employed in O&amp;G.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo Biden's plan will not include a carbon tax or cap-and-trade bill, or at least won't focus on it. Instead it will involve pumping trillions into green energy infrastructure with the goal of getting Americans across the Sunbelt &amp; Texas employed in Green Energy, as an electoral counterweight to all those employed in O&amp;G. Getting people dependent on green energy in swing states is the only path forward for democrats.\n\nIn other words, Biden will order Mama Yellen to sell trillions and trillions of Treasury bonds, which JPOW will happily exchange for real dollars, which will then be used to give fat government contracts to ICLN\u2019s holdings and beyond.\n\n# How to monetize this:\n\nICLN\u2019s holdings are only 34% US based. Which is less than ideal because Biden's platform includes \"Buy American\" and one of their political goals is to employ as many Americans as possible in green energy, so I expect them to prioritize American companies when handing out contracts. Though of course, if Biden is pumping a million trillion into solar, I can't imagine South Korean solar panel producers don't also get some of that.\n\nACES (another clean energy ETF) is 80% US and 20% Canadian, and TAN (solar focused) is 50% US. ACES is lower volume though and has fewer strikes so it's up to you, I think it's getting slept on here.\n\nAdditionally, if you don't already have enough exposure to TSLA through stock, options and ARKK, QCLN is another option similar to ICLN.\n\n# Positions:\n\n50 shares each of TAN, ACES. 100 shares of ICLN\n\n5x TAN 4/16 125c\n\n5x ICLN 7/16 31c\n\n4x ACES 6/18 96c",

        "selftext": "*This does not constitute financial advice, as with all investments it is your financial responsibility to conduct your own DD and assess whether the investment aligns properly with your short-term and long-term strategies.*\n\n**CODEBASE VENTURES** \\- [https://www.codebase.ventures/](https://www.codebase.ventures/)  \n**TICKER:** CODE (CSE); BKLLF (OTCQB); C5B (FSE)  \n**PT\u2019s in CAD:** $1 (Short), $3.5 (Medium), $10 (Long)\n\n**What is Codebase Ventures?**  \nCodebase Ventures is a venture capital firm based out of Vancouver, British Columbia focused on investing in emerging markets predominantly related to the fields of technology and pharmacy. They have been operational since 2009, finding a good foothold in the blockchain, AI, cannabis and, most recently, psychedelic sectors. Their holdings which we will touch upon today are Arcology (Blockchain), Pressland (AI/News/Media), and very briefly World High Life (Cannabis) and Titan Shrooms &amp; Psychedelics Inc. (Psychedelics). There is a lot to cover with this company, but I am going to focus more predominantly on catalysts that will have them act bullishly in 2021. My overall assessment of this company is that it has been completely underwritten and is likely to be a sleeping giant that could conservatively have $50 (CAD) shares by the end of the decade.\n\nThe company\u2019s primary focus at the moment is blockchain and supporting its blockchain initiatives. This is highlighted by their recent acquisitions over the summer.\n\n**BEFORE BEGINNING** (Skip if you understand what blockchain is and know how it will be used)*Here are a handful of videos one can watch to better understand what blockchain is:*  \n**Vice: Inside the cryptocurrency revolution -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-vrdPtZVXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-vrdPtZVXc)**How does Blockchain work?** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo\\_EIwHSd4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)\n\n**HOLDINGS**\n\n**Arcology (Blockchain) -** [https://arcology.network/](https://arcology.network/)\n\nCurrently, Codebase Ventures owns 30% of Arcology, with the option to expand that to 51% ownership.\n\nArcology is a company focused on building a highly advanced blockchain network with the intention of it being utilized in both public and private sectors. The Arcology network itself is one that is highly malleable with a number of possible use cases ranging from the internet of things to social infrastructure including digital id\u2019s, wallets, and banking, to private industry, to cloud based storage and PC security. The network is being designed with real world applications in mind, and is a strong contender for adoption by governments and private corporations as blockchain becomes increasingly pervasive and essential to society\u2019s day to day lives. It is likely that in the future, most digital devices will utilize blockchain for increased security purposes amongst a number of other things.\n\nThere are several essential problems with current blockchain networks; these include expensive and slow storage, unscalable system architecture, lack of serial execution, unsophisticated consensus algorithms, inefficient network communication, weak security models and fragmented ecosystems. All of these problems make blockchain, in its current form, incredibly bulky and impractical for real life application. These systems would be incredibly expensive to implement and sustain, requiring significant computational power. They are also very slow, which is something unreasonable when we consider how many transactions (interactions that can be recorded as data) occur in a given second all across the world. Needless to say\u2026 Most blockchain networks cannot be integrated into society on a large scale due to their lack of technological capability to upscale with social demands. While on a micro-cosmic scale we can integrate current blockchain networks to fulfil small duties, we cannot implement them in a way in which something like a smart city or smart cities would be possible. To do this, we would need a network that is fast, cheap and very smart.\n\nThis is essentially what Arcology is proposing itself to be. An incredibly fast, cheap and intelligent blockchain solution. They are the world\u2019s first self-organizing, hierarchical blockchain network that is simultaneously scalable, secure and fully decentralized, which is made possible through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In past reports, Arcology has shown itself to be well on its way to surpassing a million transactions per second, which would make it the fastest blockchain network on Earth currently. Simply put, it is a blockchain network for the real world, and it is likely to come out by the end of this year. In between now and then there are a number of catalysts, which I discuss a little further in the catalyst section of this report. There is huge upside potential for this network to be adopted by governments and industries, but for now, I am going to take a step back and talk a bit about some of Arcology\u2019s unique features. The following is based on the Arcology\u2019s recently released technical paper following their first testnet which can be found here: [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/introduction.html](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/introduction.html)\n\nFive unique features of the Arcology network- Microservice architecture- Fully parallel transaction processing- Cluster computation- Multifactor consensus algorithm- Self-organization of nodes\n\n*Architecture -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/arcology-architecture](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/arcology-architecture)\n\nFrom the report, *\u201cTo achieve Arcology's design goals, it naturally demands a flexible, scalable and loosely-coupled system architecture for client software. At the core of Arcology client software is a microservice base architecture. The only way to enhance blockchain infrastructure to a level that it could support millions of transactions is through horizontal scaling. In this type of design, functional modules are individually deployed on multiple machines connected by a high-speed network.\u201d* In other words, Arcology is designed to be fast, and is working on becoming the fastest blockchain network on earth.\n\n*Parallelism -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/parallel-merkle-tree](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/parallel-merkle-tree)\n\nArcology is the first and only blockchain network to achieve full parallelism. This means that transactions can be recorded simultaneously and stacked as such in the blockchain. This increases the network's security significantly and allows for greater scaling for real-world applications such as high volume financial trading, social media communication, or real-time recording for supply chains.\n\n*Cluster computation -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/solution-overview](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/solution-overview)\n\nTo quote Arcology directly, *\u201cPerhaps most important is a node cluster\u2019s ability to process transactions in parallel. This means there\u2019s no theoretical limit on how many transactions a single node cluster can process \u2014 it\u2019s simply a matter of adding more machines.\u201d* Combine this with a decently sized crypto mining operation, and the sky's the limit. Codebase recently announced their interest in acquiring a crypto mining operation which would fit in quite well to compliment Arcology. Additionally, Arcology has been weighing the option of a potential coin offering. This would be a logical step to create a peer to peer network to assist with the computational requirements of the network. I\u2019ve attached some DD\u2019s that I\u2019ve done in the past about crypto miners, they are another very bullish sector essential for our blockchain-based future in my opinion.\n\n*Consensus -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/consensus](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/consensus)\n\nThis is a section that I believe is best explained by the report, but the simplified version is this; there has long been a trilemma in the blockchain industry between scalability, security and decentralization. For a long time blockchain networks have only been able to successfully integrate two of the three at any given time, with the successful integration of all three being practically unheard of\u2026 until now. Arcology utilizes a system known as multi-factoring consensus which allows all three of these respective areas to be addressed and flips the proof of work vs proof of stake consensus algorithms on its head. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, speed and performance, and provides a fair environment for would-be-miners of their network. Ultimately, it increases the likelihood of them surpassing their million transaction target and being widely adopted both by central powers (governments and industry) as well as by smaller developers.\n\n*Self organization* \\- [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/network-partitioning](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/network-partitioning)\n\nTaken from the report, *\u201c Arcology uses a unique partitioning algorithm called Self-Organization (SO), a transparent and intelligent process that dynamically groups accounts based on certain criteria, including historical behaviour. This is possible because most transactions are not actually processed in random patterns; over time, many users show tendencies to interact with certain other users. This provides an opportunity to optimize network configuration.*\n\n*Arcology\u2019s Self-Organization is designed precisely for this. It is:*\n\n***\u25cf Adaptive:*** *a dynamic and ever-happening process;*\n\n***\u25cf Dynamic:*** *active users are grouped into shards to reduce friction;*\n\n***\u25cf Efficient:*** *cross-partition communication is reduced to negligible levels.*\n\n*Arcology\u2019s Self-Organization is a much more intelligent network partitioning solution, it will significantly reduce cross-partition communication and overhead that comes with it. Self-organizing is the technology designed for scalability.*\u201d\n\n*Storage -* [https://docs.arcology.network/docs/data-storage](https://docs.arcology.network/docs/data-storage)\n\nI also want to include this bit about cloud storage which some of my IT friends pointed out to me.\n\nStorage could be a big play for them and give them a major foothold in competing against cloud storage providers such as Apple, Amazon, Google and Dropbox. Comparing them to a service like Amazon Web Services (which generates Amazon $35.08B USD annually) Arcology has the ability to truly disrupt them. This is because Arcology proposes to be cheaper, faster and smarter in terms of data storage. It also enables for greater customizability in the hands of developers, so this ensures that your data is stored the way you want it to be, ensuring the fewest number of redundancies. No doubt, this could be a huge blow to Amazon who utilizes its AWS for the purposes of deep learning. Even if Arcology steals only a billion dollars out of the cloud storage sector, this should still put CODE at a $6 CAD per share.\n\n2021 is looking to be a perfect year for Arcology and Codebase. There are several major catalysts likely to occur between now and early 2022 for these two companies. Please see the catalyst section of this report to get a better idea of what those are.\n\n**Pressland (AI/News/Media) -** [https://pressland.com/](https://pressland.com/)\n\nPressland is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Codebase, focused on the task of combating fake news. The company is working to build audience engagement tools for news media organizations while authenticating the accuracy of published news. The goal of Pressland is to reinvigorate a new era of public trust in the news and media. They have most recently partnered up with the company Showcase in order to maximize their coverage on engagement efforts.\n\nTaken from a publication:\n\n[https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/908847/codebases-pressland-subsidiary-strikes-strategic-partnership-with-digital-platform-showcase-908847.html](https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/908847/codebases-pressland-subsidiary-strikes-strategic-partnership-with-digital-platform-showcase-908847.html)\n\n\u201cPressland has now indexed and analyzed over 10 million articles, 2 million keywords and 200,000 writers, according to Codebase. Pressland's platform uses proprietary software which, with machine learning, artificial intelligence and natural language, collects and analyzes the news media\u2019s production data.\n\nWhen commercial services debut in 2020, this data will be offered as a SaaS (Software as a Service) product to social networks, search engines and news distributors in a bid to fight fake news and misinformation\u2026\u201d\n\nPressland also appears to be on the verge of becoming a blockchain-based play. This of course makes sense, as blockchain is a secure way of securely archiving news media and user data for the purposes of long-term storage in a non-tamperable way. This of course will be important for the future, and co-aligns perfectly with their ongoing blockchain initiatives. It is likely that it will take minimal effort for the company to integrate their ongoing projects into these services.\n\n**World High Life and Titan Shrooms &amp; Psychedelics (Cannabis and Psychedelics)**\n\nWorld High Life and Titan Shrooms are two investments of Codebase. I will be talking more generally about why to be bullish on the cannabis and psychedelic sectors, as I have already covered quite a lot with this report. So, treat this as the icing on the cake. The cannabis sector is poised for a bull run after Biden\u2019s inauguration. A democratic win is good for both cannabis and psychedelics as they have a friendlier legal environment which can be helpful for long term change.\n\nWorld High Life stock recently dropped however. This is likely due to the ongoing situation in the UK (Brexit, new strain of Covid, etc.) I have to do more research into this, but in the bigger picture it\u2019s a smaller holding compared to their blockchain and AI plays. Still this may leave some concerned, to which I will indicate that during the summer 2020, World High Life had record breaking sales. The macro environment is lining up though that the cannabis sector should be able to have a good boom.\n\nTitan Shrooms is a well positioned company within the psychedelic sector, which will be a massive component of the mental health market in the near future. It is projected that mental health will be a $16 trillion USD market by 2030. There have been a number of breakthrough studies in the last two decades showing the long term impact that psychedelics can have on depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction and even Alzheimers. It will be a really large market in the future, likely changing the course of medicine altogether. Recently Oregon, DC and New Jersey decriminalized or legalized the medicinal use of plant-based psychedelics. I may write up a DD for a couple of psychedelic stocks in the future.\n\n**CATALYSTS**\n\n*Recently in the News*\n\n\\- Codebase raised $5 million in private placements since December (search up their recent private placement news releases)- Announced that they are finalizing Arcology\u2019s testnet 1.0, going to be going forward with a release of a developer kit towards the end of February. They also gave a loose timeline of upcoming events for Arcology (see upcoming).- They continue to discuss the possibility of a Arcology coin offering in the Summer of 2021. It hasn\u2019t been finalized but if you look at their recent acquisitions in the Summer of 2020, all of them indicate that this is indeed a plan that they will likely be set in motion. Of course it is yet to be confirmed, but I believe we can be cautiously optimistic.- They announced that they are going to look to expand into crypto mining. This is very exciting and very unanticipated. If we look at the crypto mining sector, HUT, RIOT, MARA, DMGI, BITF, HIVE, ARBKF, etc. we can all see that these have become incredibly bullish ventures. This also provides additional support that they may provide a coin offering, as having a crypto mining operation would enable them to do so.\n\n*Upcoming*\n\nThe following is a list of catalysts for Arcology, dates still need to be confirmed, but the likelihood is that this is the roadmap for 2021 to early 2022.\n\nArcology Working Roadmap Sequence:\n\n\\- Current Phase: addressing results from Testnet 1.0, refining technical components to improve performance data- Release Software Development Kit - CONFIRMED LATE FEBRUARY- Conduct Testnet 2.0 \u2013 focus on stability, user experience and verification - unknown- Potential Coin Offering - unknown- Conduct Full Scale Testnet - unknown- Release Mainnet - unknown\n\n*Macro Environment Catalysts*\n\n\\- For the bull case on the blockchain industry and crypto please see news articles in the appendix- Psychedelics will be receiving their first ETF on January 15th. This is likely to be incredibly bullish forcompanies within the psychedelic sector, which should include CODE. While their holdings are small incomparison to their blockchain operations, they are still a part of the sector which is bullish.- Biden being elected gives a good bull case for both cannabis and psychedelics in general, as we are likely to see more progressive laws regarding the medicinal use of both cannabis and psyches than under a Republican United States.\n\n**RISKS**\n\n*Financials*\n\nThe financial situation of the company is something to take into consideration when assessing this investment. The company is currently operating at a $19 million CAD loss. This is obviously concerning, however when one looks at their company history we can see that most of these losses were incurred more recently and directly align with their recent investments, most of which have come in the form of acquisitions. This is to be expected of any relatively new venture capital firm. Most operate at a loss until their investments come to fruition. The company has been actively trying to mitigate this by conducting a number of private offer rounds. So far they have raised 5 million in these financing rounds.\n\n*Dillution*\n\nIn the past, the company has had issues with dilution. They had to conduct a reverse 10 for 1 split in June, 2020. I think that they currently have their share structure under control, however, it is something to keep in mind with their ongoing financing rounds, where private investors are receiving both common shares and warrants. I don\u2019t think that this will present an issue, especially as these private funding rounds have been increasing the cost per share month over month, but it is worth keeping in mind.\n\n*Short Term Bitcoin Bubble*\n\nAs the company is tied to the blockchain industry, they are undoubtedly tied to fluctuations within the price of bitcoin. Long term bitcoin is expected to well surpass $100k USD in value, however, in the past several weeks, we have seen an unprecedented rise in the value of bitcoin, which has many calling for a correction. I am not sure whether this is going to happen or whether it will in fact simply sidestep at some point. I have attached in the appendix a bull-case for bitcoin in terms of upcoming catalysts. That being said, as with all investments, it is important to price cost average in, as it is your fiduciary responsibility to act responsibly with your money. In the event of a dip, I am planning on buying significantly more CODE as the long term outlook is still quite bullish, and bitcoin too is very bullish in the long term.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nCodebase Ventures is a company that is positioned quite well for substantive growth in the year 2021, and the decade onwards. Their investments in blockchain, AI, cannabis, and psychedelics are all things that will pay off in the long term. Arcology is a promising venture that should have everyone excited due to the sheer number of catalysts coming our way this year. I believe that a return to former all-time highs of $3.90 CAD, is inevitable on the rise of bitcoin alone. Throw in the rest, and we could easily see $10 CAD by the end of the year. Investors will want to have a position before February, where we should begin to see stable growth to the release of Arcology\u2019s developer kit.\n\nAnyways, on a personal note. I hope that I did this company justice. It was quite a large undertaking to get this DD out to you guys, so I hope that it proves useful. I am incredibly bullish on this company and excited to see what becomes of Arcology. Please do your own DD into them as well. They are, in no uncertain terms, very exciting and very very bullish.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nBlockchain is long term bullish, Codebase owns Arcology which has promising blockchain tech, so they are long term bullish. AI, cannabis and psychedelics are also very bullish. Overall, this company is overlooked, and people should seek a position before February.\n\n**APPENDIX**\n\nMost Recent DD\u2019s\n\nCrypto Related Watchlist:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/keb77e/crypto\\_related\\_watchlist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/keb77e/crypto_related_watchlist/)\n\nMassively Overlooked Crypto Play - HUT8 Mining DD:\n\n[reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/k9ss77/massively\\_overlooked\\_crypto\\_play\\_hut8\\_mining\\_dd/](https://reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/k9ss77/massively_overlooked_crypto_play_hut8_mining_dd/)\n\nBitcoin Bullish News\n\nStimulus:\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/)\n\nM2 Money Supply: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2)\n\nBitcoin Shortage:\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-is-headed-for-a-supply-shortage-and-that-will-keep-pushingup-prices-11609861504](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-is-headed-for-a-supply-shortage-and-that-will-keep-pushingup-prices-11609861504)\n\nInstitutional Buyers &amp; More Shortage:\n\n[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-shortage-as-wall-street-fomo-turns-btc-whales-into-plankton](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-shortage-as-wall-street-fomo-turns-btc-whales-into-plankton)\n\nPaypal Crypto Rollout:\n\n[https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency)\n\nA quote from the paypal article: *\u201cBeginning in early 2021, PayPal customers will be able to use their cryptocurrency holdings as a funding source to pay at PayPal's 26 million merchants around the globe. \u201d*",

        "selftext": "[SPX Monthly Chart:](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/7rPzyt3E-SPX-Monthly-Risk-Reward-Less-Favorable/)\n\n* The market basically closed the year at ATH (3pts off) and is within a hair of 3855, which is the 138.2% Fib of the March low.\n* The rising monthly channel (shown above) shows that markets are stretched near resistance and already outside of their bollinger bands. The weekly band is at 3774.\n* While I believe there is room for upside into 2021, the risk/reward is **NOT** favorable here anymore. Sentiment is stretched and a correction would be welcomed with open arms.\n* I anticipate a 10-15% correction to start the year, which would align us with the rising 200dma near 3219. We ended the year in a tight range, and there is potential to carry into 3855 based on January 15 open interest and gamma positioning.\n\nLast few days I have been selling stocks and calls aggressively in anticipation of a correction. I am long TLT calls (flat) and SPY puts (down 37%).\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\n* The AAII Sentiment Survey is quite elevated near multi-year highs and shows overly bullish sentiment.\n* The Advisors Sentiment Report reports the views of over 120 independent investment newsletters (those not affiliated with brokerage houses or mutual funds) and reports the findings as the percentage of advisors that are bullish, those bearish and those that expect a correction. The current Bull to Bear spread is one of the highest in decades, yet another indication of frothy sentiment.\n* The NAAIM Exposure Index is currently at 89 and off some 100+ prints but remains elevated to the averages.\n* The BAML Fund Manager Survey shows the three most crowded trades are:  \n\n   * Long Tech via shares\n   * Short USD\n   * Long Bitcoin Spot via Perpetual Swaps\n   * Fund managers are \"all-in\" on leverage. This is evidenced by our DIX print on Thursday yet again showing dark pool buying.\n* Consumer Confidence deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of COVID-19 \"remains a drag on confidence.\u201d\n* CEO Confidence, as tracked by the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index hit a two week low at 47. This is the sharpest drop in economic outlook since April.\n\n**Market Health:**\n\n* NYSE Cumulative Adv/Dec:  \n\n   * Actually pretty healthy right now. This is still well above all of its important moving averages and remains in an uptrend.\n* NYSE McClellan Oscillator:  \n\n   * Neutral currently.\n* NYSE Summation Index (NYSI):  \n\n   * Most commonly used by fund managers to find divergences. Above a short term 5/8 day exponential moving average is a buy signal. Below flashes a short term sell signal. This is *currently showing a sell signal.* However, sell signals in rallies tend to be early signals...\n* Moving Averages:  \n\n   * The 8/21-week EMA crossover has long been a favorite signal for momentum in individual names and also works with Indices. The 21-week EMA is important support for growth/momentum stocks. In general, you want to be long when the 8 week is above the 21 week and short when it is below with crossovers being key trend inflection signals. The 12-month moving average (MA) and monthly MACD are good longer-term risk management tools. The price action relative to the 200-week MA provides a good gauge for the health of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s secular trend. Pullbacks or corrections (aka cyclical bear markets) for the S&amp;P 500 that hold above or near the rising 200-week MA are a secular bull market pattern. Pullbacks that decisively break the 200-week MA are a sign of a secular bear market. Most corrections on the S&amp;P 500 during the 1950-1966 and 1980-2000 secular bull market held between the 100-week MA and the 200-week MA. The 2015-2016 S&amp;P 500 pullback fit this secular bull market correction pattern. The secular bear market periods from 1929-1950, 1966-1980, and 2000-2013 saw sustained periods below these long-term moving averages. This means that the 200-week MA provides a good secular bull market risk management tool or stop loss. Using this history as a guide suggests that the Ichimoku monthly cloud is a good trailing secular bull market stop loss. History also suggests that a decisive move below the monthly cloud confirms a secular bear market for US equities. *Currently we are above all moving averages and this is a bullish signal.*\n\n**Economics:**\n\n* The common theme appears to be an expectation of a synchronized global growth in 2021.\n* The optimism on 2021 delivering a record year for corporate profit growth and strong GDP growth around the globe is very contingent on a successful vaccine rollout. The current surge of cases and hospitalizations in the US and Europe is resulting in further restrictions and lockdowns that will weigh on growth expectations, or at least push out pent-up demand. Consumers have led the recovery so far with a boost from fiscal stimulus but the key to a self-sustained recovery is a strong capex cycle which is seen kicking off in Q2 2021. The labor market will also be in focus after record low unemployment the pandemic saw the number jump to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression, but has recovered rapidly though losing some momentum as it finished the year near 6.5% unemployment and consensus expectations to reach 5% by the end of 2021, still far-off from the 3.5% pre-crisis rate.\n* The recovery has already started in 2H20 in the US &amp; China while the European recovery has been more subdued. The driver of the strong 2021 recovery will be the full reopening of economies worldwide which makes a successful vaccine distribution critical. The US Dollar is closing 2020 weak and looks to have some structural issues with surging deficits, Fed\u2019s intention to boost inflation, easy financial conditions, and expected economic and political improvements. The combination of easy monetary policy, a rebound in old economy industries and a global upswing in growth provides a healthy backdrop for 2021. The balance sheets of households, corporate and governments are expanding alongside the aggressive monetary policy and signs of inflation returning causing a rotation back to value and cyclical growth supported by a steepening yield curve.\n* GDP is seeing rising 6.4% globally in 2021 according to Morgan Stanley, the consensus is for 5.4% growth. In the US those numbers are 5.9% and 3.8% respectively.\n* Inflation would be the key risk into 2021 with it likely to start showing up in 2H21, and the risk being an overshoot could start a disruptive shift in Fed policy. Surging debt remains another concern, as a share of U.S. GDP, total debt has spiked near a record high and total nonfinancial debt has surged to new all-time highs. The rapid increase in government deficits is due to the combination of 1) the budget shortfall that already existed and was growing, plus 2) the deficit spending to fund the stimulus programs to date.\n* The other clear risk in 2021 is China where debt defaults are rising and could spark a move to credit tightening and a recession that would strangle the global recovery. The overall default rate is currently low but the percentage spike in debt/GDP was the highest since 2009 which could lead to policy tightening in 2021.\n\n**Market Valuation and Fundamentals:**\n\n* The NASDAQ continue to outperform in 2020 with a 45%+ YTD return compared to the S&amp;P at +15% as major secular trends in technology continue to play out. The trend of rapid rotational moves also continue with growth often seeing selling pressure for a few days before quickly recovering and resuming the longer-term uptrends. Into 2021 earnings growth is expected to be a record though room for multiple expansion is minimal. A combination of improving economic conditions causing greater business and consumer confidence should drive strong earnings growth in 2021. Increased fiscal spending and a moderation of tariffs provide additional tailwinds. In 2020 many businesses shedded labor and transformed business models to higher productivity to offset the collapse in demand and low inventories with rebounding production point to margin expansion in 2021. The 2021 environment shapes up to be one of solid earnings growth, a return of buybacks and modest multiple contraction. The growth versus value debate is likely to continue but the low-rate environment continues to favor growth, but even more-so a greater preference for quality, companies with strong balance sheets, cash flow generation, and returns on capital should continue to outperform. We are seeing historically strong earnings revision ratios and a record percentage of stocks with dividend yields above the rate of the ten-year Treasury, both conducive to allocations to equities. Compared to bonds, equities can act as a hedge in case of inflation and, with a thorough selection process, can still offer returns closer to historical returns.\n* My forecasts for 2021 take into account consensus expectations, a bull case for a strong vaccine rollout, and a bear case for disruptions to the vaccine rollout and geopolicatical potential issues. I am assigning a 40% probability for the bull case, 40% for the base case, and 20% for the bear case to arrive at a S&amp;P fair value of 3600 though 1H21. In 2H21 we start to look to 2022 estimates and feel we can approach $200 EPS with slight multiple contraction to 22X leaving upside potential to 4400 for year-end 2021.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU](https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU)\n\n* For 2021, the bottom-up EPS estimate (which reflects an aggregation of the median EPS estimates for CY 2021 for all of the companies in the index) is $169.20. For CY 2021, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 21.7% and revenue growth of 7.7%. The 6% trend growth rate since the 1930s would point to S&amp;P 500 EPS getting back to trend levels of $187 in 2022. An optimistic vaccine scenario would see S&amp;P 2022 EPS well above $200.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3](https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3)\n\n* The low rate environment impacts the multiple, and assuming the 10-year stays low, the Fed keeps rates at zero, and credit spreads stay firm, a valuation framework would put a trailing PE at 24X and forward at 21.5X for the current environment. The spread between the S&amp;P dividend yield versus the corporate Baa bond yield is near historical highs and the ERP (Equity Risk Premium) is very high by many measures. Assuming the spread between the dividend yield and IG corporate yield goes back to 2012-19 levels, it would point to 30%- plus upside for S&amp;P 500 valuations. Assuming some rise in rates as the spread narrows more from falling equity yields would point to 20%-plus upside. In 2021, policy support should remain in place to curtail risk aversion. Besides the risk of a credit crisis, concerns over a late-cycle overheating have been pushed further out due to the pandemic-induced recession and policy makers\u2019 increased inflation tolerance. When comparing relative attractiveness across asset classes, which ultimately steers a substantial part of investment flows, equity markets continue to look quite attractive. Since the beginning of 2020, real bond yields in the USA have declined by over 100 basis points, outpacing the decline in earnings yields (inverse of the price-earnings ratio), thus supporting higher valuation multiples. Currently the difference between the earnings yield and the real bond yield as a measure for the equity risk premium (ERP) is higher than the long-term average, suggesting that equities offer an attractive excess return over bonds. Although lower interest rates support higher multiples due to the increase value of future earnings, a return to normal could push long-term interest rates higher and exert downward pressure on equity valuation multiples.\n\n[Sector Growth Rates](https://imgur.com/a/IJPIPWW)\n\n**Analyst 2021 Predictions:**\n\n* Morgan Stanley: $3900 - After a year of big swings in valuations, 2021 will be about who can deliver on earnings. 2020 was all about beta and understanding how equity markets trade in and around a recession that handed us the fattest pitch we\u2019ve seen in a decade. 2021 will be much more about stock picking (alpha) and should favor those companies that can deliver earnings growth that isn\u2019t already expected or priced. MSCO prefers companies with earnings growth most tied to re-openings and an economic recovery and also favors small caps. Financials are also preferred due to positive upside skew on rising rates and better credit; Materials and Industrials on demand rebound, earnings leverage and inflation protection; and Health Care given its GARP characteristics and re-rating potential with fading political overhangs.\n* Bank of America: $3800 - Stocks have already priced in much of the expected recovery in the economy and corporate profitability, leaving just slightly more upside heading into next year. Even as investors ride a wave of vaccine-related optimism, potential negative catalysts abound. The recovery is intact and the world likely reopens in the 2H, but a lot of optimism is priced in already on vaccine/recovery. Vaccine execution risk, delayed fiscal stimulus and longer lockdowns are risks. But a few themes support stocks: the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield is 3x the 10-year yield, and S&amp;P 500 dividends are set to increase in 2021. And unlike bond yields, earnings are nominal and participate in inflationary upside \u2013 where inflation risks may be running higher, given rampant money-printing and a potential post-vaccine spike in demand. BAML picks value stocks over growth, cyclicals over defensives and small caps over large caps, given each of these groups\u2019 likelihoods to be disproportionately boosted by a post-virus economic recovery.\n* Goldman Sachs: $4300 - A vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. The economic reopening coming alongside a vaccine, in tandem with a status quo policy environment cemented with a divided government, will help push the S&amp;P 500 to 4,300 by year-end 2021 and then to 4,600 by the end of 2022. The forecast assumes that the Senate will remain under Republican control following the Georgia run-off elections in January, the economy will continue on a path toward a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, corporate profits will rebound, Fed funds rate will hold near-zero and the yield curve will steepen while the 10-year Treasury yield climbs only modestly.\n* Deutsche Bank: $3950 - Much of 2020\u2019s run-up in the stock market came with multiples expansion, as prices escalated despite a drop in earnings, as companies dealt with fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. Next year, as the economy recovers and a vaccine allows for long-lasting re-openings, earnings growth will rebound and multiples will de-rate. The pattern of the equity market recovery, bottoming halfway through recession and recouping most of its losses before it\u2019s over, has been typical but the continued run-up means valuations are high. In our reading, elevated multiples reflect increased participation of retail investors which we see as sustaining, but we expect the multiple to begin to de-rate. For 2021, a recovery in earnings \u2014 which essentially increases the denominator of the price-earnings ratio \u2014 should lower multiples. That said, an increase in companies\u2019 payout ratios as dividends and buybacks return could at least partially offset this. A gradual correction of overvaluation argues for the current overvaluation of 5 multiple points to diminish but remain significant at 3.6 points, putting the end-2021 multiple at 20.5X.\n* Jefferies: $4200 - Improving prospects for a vaccine, easy lending conditions and broader participation among cyclical and value stocks will help propel the stock market higher in 2021. November\u2019s historic stock market rally, led by cyclical and value stocks in the energy, financials and industrials sectors, reflected broadening equity strength beyond just big tech and software shares. That rotation is anticipated to continue into next year, helping push the broader market higher. Notwithstanding the second and third Covid-19 waves permeating the world, there is a palpable feeling that the global economy is resynchronizing with the household, corporate and government balance sheets expanding simultaneously alongside aggressive monetary policy. The much-maligned value and cyclical growth sectors are slowly making a comeback as inflation pressures begin to return. This rotation has been supported by a steepening in the yield curve and with growthier stocks trading sideways. Improved visibility towards a successful coronavirus vaccine, easier lending conditions, little evidence of deflation and a sentiment switch from growth to value will lift US bank shares through 2021. Rising global capacity utilization rates, firmer producer prices, improving world trade volume, booming housing/autos and a weak dollar are the perfect environment for the S&amp;P 500 Industrials. The S&amp;P 500 materials sector is blowing off in response to a weak dollar, higher commodity prices, an upswing in global manufacturing and a restocking cycle.\n* CSFB: $4050 - Our 2021 forecasts are designed to answer a simple question: what the future will (2022) look like in the future (end of 2021). From this perspective, we are forced to de-emphasize the near-term, focusing instead on the return to a more normal world. As we look toward 2022, the virus will be a fading memory, the economy robust, but decelerating, the yield curve steeper and volatility lower, and the rotation into cyclicals largely behind us. Since the stock market discounts future events, each of these prospects for further improvement down the line should translate into a higher S&amp;P 500 as investors price in these events.\n* UBS: $4100 - The vaccine-related developments that drove stocks\u2019 gains in November and early December have now been baked into market expectations, leaving vaccine distribution the next milestone for equity investors to consider in 2021. The key driver of U.S. equities will be the pace of vaccinations, similar to how shifts in mobility drove equities through the spring and summer. As people get vaccinated, they are likely to \u2018normalize\u2019 spending on areas impacted by COVID shortly thereafter. We see the rotation toward cyclical services spending and other COVID-hit areas as a key investment theme for 2021. UBS is overweight the consumer discretionary, industrials and energy sectors given that consumption and production will likely rebound next year. It downgraded materials and financials to Neutral. It is also Underweight consumer staples, utilities and REITs and Neutral on information technology, but overweight communication services and health care on still attractive growth relative to valuations. UBS maintained an upside case for the S&amp;P 500 of 4,400, which would emerge in the case of higher-than-baseline growth against a backdrop of still-low interest rates. However, in a downside case, the S&amp;P 500 could fall to 3,300, which would entail a weaker recovery and/or tighter financial conditions.\n* BMO Capital: $4200 - Heading into 2021, stocks are poised to keep reaping the benefits of the massive infusion of monetary support from the Federal Reserve, along with an anticipated additional round of fiscal stimulus. This constructive policy environment is likely to help push equities higher even as virus concerns linger for at least the first several months of the new year. Even with recent positive vaccine and treatment developments, the global pandemic and its unprecedented impact is unlikely to fade in coming months. As such, the massive fiscal and monetary response in the U.S. and around the world (also unprecedented) will likely remain in place to combat its negative economic impact for the foreseeable future. Such environments have historically supported continued stock market gains and we see no reason why 2021 will be any different. Aside from the global financial crisis, 2020 represented the swiftest quarter-over-quarter earnings collapse for the S&amp;P 500 where index EPS plummeted nearly 50% during 1Q, thus, we anticipate that 2021 has the potential to be one of the best years ever in terms of earnings growth, something we believe will also help to push stock prices higher. We remain optimistic and expect another year of double-digit gains as the economy and society slowly transition back to normal.\n* Barclays: $4000 - Markets are right to be optimistic about the global economic outlook in 2021, with growth returning and inflation rising but staying below central bank targets. Projected global gross domestic product growth of 5.6% in 2021, rebounding from a 3.6% contraction this year, with most Western economies reaching so-called herd immunity from Covid-19 in the second and third quarters of the year. Forecasts reflected the recent slew of positive vaccine results with efficacy rates exceeding expectations, which point to a significant boost for growth in the second quarter of 2021. Barclays also suggested the inflation outlook would not indicate any unwinding of current unprecedented levels of central bank support. Labor markets are recovering, but we are still at very high unemployment, so there is undeniably a lot of slack in the system. That means that when it comes to core inflation and the underlying drivers, to wage costs etc., that was unlikely to happen in the short run, meaning even next year. It would take several years really to come back. While Barclays anticipates a gradual improvement in inflation, it will not be significant enough to cause central banks to consider tightening their accommodative monetary policy stances. We have an environment whereby growth comes back, inflation stays relatively muted, and you have central banks continuing to support the recovery, and tightening is still far out.\n* Oppenheimer: $4300 - The S&amp;P 500 is likely to post another double-digit percentage gain in 2021 as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines underpins a lasting economic recovery. This outcome is based on six key assumptions: First, that the public will expediently accept and receive COVID-19 vaccines and second, that equity investors will discount the success of the vaccines in reversing the disruptions brought on by the pandemic. Thirdly assumes that at least one of the two Senate seats in the Georgia runoff election will go to a Republican lawmaker, thereby retaining their control of the Senate and reducing (if not necessarily eliminating) the risk that the Biden administration will eradicate the corporate tax reform act of 2017. Fourth, the Federal Reserve will continue its low interest rate regime in tandem with accommodative monetary policy, and fifthly, that congressional lawmakers will step in with another round of fiscal stimulus by the first quarter of 2021 at the latest. Lastly, that investor appetite will continue to tilt toward \u201cstocks that favor diversification and both growth and value segments of the market in a relatively low interest rate environment that favors equities, real assets and other asset classes over fixed income for intermediate and longer-term objectives. The vaccine rollout is arguably the most important in determining the trajectory of the S&amp;P 500 next year. Ultimately the stock market is broadly dependent on economic growth to drive revenues and earnings across the sectors.\n* JP Morgan: $4400 - Investors are entering 2021 against a confluence of market-positive events, including improving prospects for widespread vaccinations and sustained economic reopening, gridlock in Washington and accommodative central bank policy. Given the COVID-19 crisis, vaccine distribution is likely the linchpin event. But even with widespread vaccine availability still months away, optimism over early vaccine efficacy data has already sparked a rally among stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic. The equity market is facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years. After a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing. We expect a \u2018market nirvana\u2019 scenario for equities with the melt-up continuing into 1H21, driven by earnings recovery and multiple expansion. Much of next year\u2019s stock market rise is likely to come at the beginning of the year, as lingering uncertainties over vaccine distribution, the results of the Georgia senate race and additional monetary and fiscal stimulus start to dissipate. While the broader backdrop should still remain constructive in the second half of next year, by then the market will have likely priced in close to a full recovery and investors may start to expect a gradual shift in central bank forward guidance away from the current exceptionally accommodative stance.\n* BTIG - $4000 - Global synchronized growth underpinned by central bank ease and a Washington which sees Election 2020\u2019s decidedly mixed outcomes as a catalyst for cooperation (spend, it\u2019s necessary) and centrist government (no tax hikes) results in a Redistribution of Wealth consistent with the 2003-06 synchronized reflation period where Value outperformed. Growth, Small Cap outperformed Large Cap, and International equities outperformed the S&amp;P 500.\n\n**Gold:**\n\n* [Monthly](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GLD/TUbcSBg2-GLD/)\n* Gold had a solid year in 2020 gaining more than 20% as a long base breakout that triggered in June 2019 continued to play out higher and reached its measured move objective while the rally briefly broke above 2011 highs before pulling back. If we look at Fibonacci extension targets of the 2011-2015 correction GLD has upside targets at $207 and $220. The 2018-2020 rally has Fibonacci retracement support levels at $162.5 and $152.5. Gold rallied in 2020 on economic uncertainty and a flight to safety and has pulled back in Q4 with the greater optimism for 2021 taking hold. On an allocation basis, Gold may be losing some of its luster as a store of value with the momentum seen in Bitcoin , although that has not been seen to this point with global gold ETF inflows topping a record in 2020 as a way to diversify portfolios and hedge against inflation. However, November saw the second largest outflow on record. In 2020 the lockdowns resulted in a 5% decline in global output, so the supply-side is expected to rebound in 2021. Gold prices should be supported by inflationary pressures, a deep fiscal deficit and a weaker USD. Goldman sees Gold reaching $2300 in 2021 as recovery from the coronavirus-related recession fuels higher inflation next year. Further fuel could be added from a recovery in demand from India and China.",

Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day\n\nWe also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again &amp; continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small &amp; mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil &amp; Gas companies.\n\nYesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more &amp; more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it\u2019s one of the best for long-term investing.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED\u2019s Beige Book.\n\nWhile in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it\u2019s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&amp;A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production &amp; airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it\u2019s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.\n\nWe also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell &amp; hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell &amp; hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It\u2019s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services &amp; selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It\u2019s seems a good &amp; interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.\n\nIn the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK\u2019s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren\u2019t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan &amp; others.\n\nWe also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain. \n\n \ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "I haven't invested since August, and their haven't been any dips in the market since early November. Even then, it was a small dip and the market shot up 800 points or so for the next few days. The market also seems to not be making any sense because every time the unemployment numbers are increasing the market shoots up.\n\nIt's mainly due to injections of liquidity from the fed reserve. But, at some point the house of cards has to fall. A lot of these companies that are going up are IPOs that solely went up because of niche markets that would not have been as big if the coronavirus had not have happened ex: peloton, zoom, some cloud stocks etc. Now it's hard to even find a stock under $100 because the whole market has been overflooded with newby investors, liquidity, and activist hedge funds that are trying to keep retail and manufacturing relevant that is keeping the blue chip stocks propped up as well. \n\nWith that said, at these prices is it still worth it to buy a couple shares of these overvalued firms like Zoom, Netflix, Amazon, Peloton, Tesla etc. \n\nLook for another IPO that may or may not go up? Draft Kings, Air bnb, Snowflake, beyond meat, rackspace, etc\n\nOr just wait it out logically like Buffett used to say in one of speeches be patient and only buy something if you know you can hold it for 10s. However, the more I feel I'm waiting the more I feel like I'm just letting my money sit doing nothing and I'm losing out on opportunity cost. These values just make no sense though, and every IPO that comes out sees even higher percentage gains than the one before it. The regular blue chip stocks that are steady like Microsoft, Visa, Proctor and Gamble, Walmart etc that seem like the best companies profit, revenue, and management wise don't rise up in value near as much as some poorly invested startup IPO in a niche market that has negative earnings every quarter. It just makes no sense. \n\nSo, basically is it still worth it to invest in 2021, or should we all just sit out and wait for it to drop like how much higher can it go?  \nAnd if so what makes for better investments in our current times blue chips that are less worrisome, tech companies, solar/renewables, or IPOs?",

        "selftext": "Amazon is due for the breakout. It did a big try beforce christmas but came back down. They haven't released the christmas sales informations, what they usually do. My guess is they will either do it soon or keep them for earnings.\n\nChrismas must have been absolut gigantic for Papa Bezos. Last Q4 they had a 62% earnings surprise and rose 8,11% after earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Quarter|Consenus Estimate|EPS|Stockmove|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020-Q4|6.96|?||\n|2020-Q3|7.41|12.37 (+66.94%)|\\-4%|\n|2020-Q2|1.74|10.3 (+491.95%)|\\+4.32%|\n|2020-Q1|6.36|5.01 (-21.23%)|\\-3.65%|\n|2019-Q4|3.98|6.47 (+62.56%)|8.11% &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;|\n|2019-Q3|4.46|4.23 (-5.16%)|0%|\n|2019-Q2|5.29|5.22 (-1.32%)|\\-2.89%|\n|2019-Q1|4.61|7.09 (+53.80%)|\\+2.57%|\n|2018-Q4|5.55|6.04 (+8.84%)|\\-2.65%|\n|2017-Q4|1.85|2.16 (+16.76%)|\\-1.44%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Corona hit us and we all know people spend a lot more time online shopping then usual!

As you can see these investements made huge gains YoY and I wouldnt be surprised if the make more than 200% YoY in Q4! Chrismas was stay at home and let it deliver. 600$ Stimulus went straight in Amazon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe EPS estimate for Q4 2020 is 6.97.

Would you guess they grow earnings for 20% YoY? I would make a wild guess for 150-200%\n\nIf that is true we could see an epic 10-15% move of the stock after earnings. Q4 2019 disrupted the stock and pushed it 8% higher and the surprice was only 60%. If you take the 200% Growth YoY Q4 it would surprise by 300% which could lead to absolute new ATHs.\n\nMy estimate: 150% YoY Q4, which bringt earnings to **16,175 EPS and a surprise of 232%**(!!!!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: BUY AMAZON! Amazon 3.800-4.000 MAY CONFIRMED** **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**\n\nPositon: 150 Stock and will buy 3800 weelies before the earnings (2/4/21)",

        "selftext": "Hey degenerates, while I haven't posted here for some time, I haven't stopped lurking in this cozy little autism-den we call home. So suffice to say I have noticed the obsession this sub has developed for PSTH and come with information on what I believe is gonna quickly become Ackman's #1 target: Plaid. \n\nWhy had Plaid never come up as a target before?\nWell, up until a couple of hours ago, Visa had an agreement to buy plaid for about $5b. The DOJ was trying to stop this merger and, low and behold, they won and the agreement was terminated. \n\nOkay cool, but why plaid?\nPlaid checks all of Ackman's boxes. Unicorn- check. Fintech- check. Huge growth- check. High barrier to entry and strong competitive position- check. Oh also, Ackman hates that he missed out on buying a piece of Visa in the past so what better way to fill that hole than with Visa's sloppy seconds?\n\nTbh, I'm too busy to write out the dozens of reasons why this is the perfect target but it's pretty obvious once one looks into Plaid and Ackman's criteria. The only reason why no articles have been written speculating such is because the merger was only terminated a couple of hours ago. Expect a nice share price bump once the media starts speculating so do with that what you will.",

        "selftext": "#I warn you that this will be quite the long read, but one that you will hopefully thank me for.\n\n\nAnother day, another EV play. TSLA and NIO are both examples of EV companies that have capitalized on the gains resulting from being early to the party for electric cars.\n\n\nAwesome. But there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet, and that this company has a first-mover advantage on (just like NIO and TSLA did): **The medium-heavy duty vehicles.**\n\nToday, I present you with an opportunity to be early to this party featuring the sleeping giant that is:\n\n#LION ELECTRIC ($NGA)\n\nIt is currently trading under the SPAC ticker $NGA with a merger completion set for the end of Q1. \n\n**That\u2019s right, by buying 1 share of $NGA right now, you are effectively buying 1 share of Lion Electric. For anyone who wants to better understand SPACs, I highly recommend a quick search on Investopedia.** \n\nLet me preface this post by saying that [Lion Electric](https://thelionelectric.com/en) has been working on their vehicles, battery technology, and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the [largest fleet of electified school buses](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:~:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.) on the road in North America as we speak. \n\n#[Here is the link to their investor presentation where they are already forecasting a positive EBITDA by the end of 2021. Highly recommend skimming over it, but I will highlight the main points later on in the post for yall anyways.](https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf)\n\n\n\n#*So why haven't I heard about this \"Lion Electric\" company?*\n\nSimple answer: it's a Canadian company located in Quebec. No company outside of America or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits and subsidies in Quebec are great, but other than that you are right. The good thing is that it ain't gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in [Michigan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html) where it delivered the state's first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the [merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination) with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).\n\n\n\n#*So, why should I care?* \n\n\n**Because Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care.** \n\n\nNews silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on 'silently' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a slimy PR team. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). \n\n**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** \n\nAnd, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla's truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon's facilities, and most importantly they are ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. [See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.](https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8)\n\n#*And what about Joe Biden?* \n\n**Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) over the next 4 years**\n\nNO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), [where the Co-chair of Biden's Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). Their client from Twin Rivers Unified School District went as far as labelling Lion's electric buses as the **[Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses]**(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StpnGrItO4E&amp;t=45s). \n\nI\u2019m sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? [A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not compare their revenue projections to Lion's past the year 2021, as they would've admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) \n\n\n**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion's revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra's entire revenue in 2025.**\n\nAnyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be providing buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.\n\n\n\n#*Why should I be buying NOW?*\n\n**Because tomorrow may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**\n\nJim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TODAY most likely](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this it takes off. NGA is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going to pump Lion to the best of abilities on Mad Money, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. \n\n**How do I know $NGA will get pumped so hard?** The CEO of Lion featured on a [local news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I'm sure quite a few of you won't understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy will wreak havoc in the market. \n\n**Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.**\n\n\n\n#*But why should I pick Lion Electric over all the other EV stocks that get spammed in here?*\n\n\n\n**Because Lion Electric offers much more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes**\n\n\n\n\u00b7 There are currently 7 different [trucks and buses](https://imgur.com/L1cu6oS) **available for purchase**\n\n\n\u00b7 They already have **300+ vehicles on the road** today with over \n  6mil miles between them \n\n\n\u00b7 Multi-year deal agreement for **Amazon** to purchase up to \n  2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger \n  and more lucrative opportunities afterwards\n\n\n\u00b7 **CN (huge Canadian transporter)** recently Purchased 50 \n  trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later\n\n\n\u00b7 **Government-backed**: [Canada's prime minister Justin \n  Trudeau supports the company](https://imgur.com/xoJ9Kze), \n  while nationalized companies like Hydro Quebec and SAQ have \n  purchase agreements in place that provide a strong foundation \n  for Lion's business\n\n\n\u00b7 **Produce their own batteries:** on top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is \n  building a facility to and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale \n  production, set to be completed in 2022\n\n\n\u00b7 **V2G technology** ready for the batteries, and implemented \n  into their school buses\n\n\n\u00b7 Deals with **BMW, ChargePoint, Nuvve, and Romeo Power**\n\n\n\u00b7 **[8 NEW vehicles](https://imgur.com/dFFTczt)** to be produced between 2021-2022 \n  including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks\n\n\u00b7 [USA expansion](https://imgur.com/wFbrle5) completed by \n  2022, will give them a **\"Made in America\"** image\n\n\n\u00b7 NKLA *obviously* had to [scrap their deal on the table with Republic Services](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/23/tech/nikola-garbage-truck- \n  canceled/index.html) to \n  provide them with up to **5000 garbage disposal trucks** just a \n  few weeks ago. Who could possibly fill the void and has a ZERO EMISSION\n  refuse truck ready for purchase? Lion Electric, that's \n  who. [See the truck in action here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsNQwjXDP4)\n\n\n\n#*How about their financials??*\n\n#[Well, here are their financials and revenue projections](https://imgur.com/uLp1pf3)\n\n\u00b7 Projected revenue of **3.6 billion $** by 2024\n\n\u00b7 **Cash flow positive** in 2023\n\n\u00b7 **EBITDA positive by end of 2021**, with EBITDA growth of \n  approximately 16% YOY afterwards\n\n\u00b7 Cost reduction of 50% by 2024 **(better profit margins)**\n\n\n\n\n\n#**TL;DR:** \n\nUndervalued EV company tied to Amazon that has product labelled as the \"Tesla of school buses\". CEO will appear on Mad Money today most likely, and $NGA will fly past 30$. \n\n#**POSITIONS:** \n\n[Here.](https://imgur.com/L4gr51J) 700 $NGA shares and 1k warrants, with an extra 500 shares in a separate account.

        "selftext": "Hi Guys, \n\nSince I'm in the Canadian investor sub for the past few years and it is the closest group that would be in a similar setting (In canada, personal finance / investments) I thought I'd post this here.\n\nMy wallet was stolen from my truck last night and in it were :\n\n* 1x Company Credit Card (VISA) provided by my job for gas expenses on the company vehicle\n* 1x Personal BMO Credit Card\n* 1x Personal BMO Debit Card\n* Driver's license and healthcare card (PITA to retrieve new copies specially during COVID)\n* 100$ in cash\n\nAs a wrap-up, this morning at 5:45 AM the bank sent me an E-mail message alerting me of suspicious activity which I only saw at 9AM when I got up. Curious I logged into my bank account to find money was spent on my personal credit card AND on my debit card at two local corner stores that are within 5km of where I live. This made me automatically slip a coat on to confirm my wallet was removed from the truck and that a mess was made of other papers in the storage compartments. I had all cards confirmed cancelled and new cards posted to me.\n\nSince I don't get direct alerts for the company VISA, I called and was able to confirm 6 transactions were made also at local corner stores, some purchases were made TWICE at the same corner store on the same card. \n\nAll the purchases are between 85$ and 98$ (PAYPASS probably trying to keep the limit below 100$)\n\nI have personally called some of these corner stores to inform them that purchases were made there with stolen cards and have made an official file and declaration with the police.\n\nIt seems rather peculiar that someone can spend over 800$ at different gas stations / corner stores within an hour or so what type of purchases are most likely made? Gas? 800 Liters of gas? I'm looking to pick you guy's smart brains and see if I can help these stores and the police with any clues to look for, I especially would like these types of people to get caught and not get away with it.\n\nSince all these transactions (Total of 8) were made within stores(5-6 stores) that probably all have camera surveillance and I have most of the \"timestamps\" on the transctions + the police is involved, has anyone ever had any luck catching thieves by going through this process?\n\nWay to start 2021  ! Happy New Years to all and thanks for reading!",

Again my opinions, but now these trolls leaking in from their discord, is really starting to annoy me. Protos is nothing, and if you're telling me that that deal led to a \"5-unit\" purchase, then it looks to me like AITX has no idea how to market or pitch OR there really isn't demand for motion sensors.\n\n\\- Also, watch the webinar, another shady video the dude has no idea what he's talking about.\n\nThis is the OTC Nikola imo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso: if you're going to come at me, at least come at me with some goddamn debate driven material, not \"lol ur a bagholder lolol\" stop it.",

        "selftext": "I see a lot of people being bullish on chinese EV companies. Almost the majority of opinions I read/hear will say \"buy buy buy\". I saw some red flags recently and I have decided to make my own research. I wanted to make a fact-based, data-backed analysis and try to predict where this thing is actually going.\n\nI found out some interesting things - TLDR: I don't agree with the strong bullish sentiment around these stocks right now.\n\nAfter quite some gains, it can be difficult to part with these stocks, but taking profits looks like the safe thing to do when it comes to these companies. In fact, all three are highly valued: XPeng trades for 2021 projected revenues of more than 15 times. NIO for 11 times 2021 revenue and Li for about 10 times 2021 sales. Additionally, for at least a couple more years, neither will have significant profits [according to analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nio/analysis?ltr=1).\n\nSeveral business, government, and market threats are also tough challenges for Chinese EV firms. Chinese state subsidies are dropping and may expire, while in China, competition for EVs is getting fierce. In addition, a recent bill passed by Congress aims to delist Chinese firms whose accounting methods are not up to U.S. requirements.\n\nThen, the recently arrived Covid vaccinations could make the process of taking the market's attention away from high growth stocks and directing it to businesses which were the most damaged by the spread of the virus only faster.\n\nI have also [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NNG1hm-9VM) about this, where I share my predictions and estimations and I add a few more red flags I have found in my research (all baked with data and facts, but I kept the video short and concise).\n\nWhat do you guys think about this? Are you feeling bullish or do you also share my sentiment?",

        "selftext": "Seems that the excitement (and concern) has subsided about the tax implications of SPACs that might be a PFIC.  I have spent the last couple weeks digging into the topic and share the conclusions that I settled upon for myself.\n\nObligatory disclaimer: I am not a CPA. I am not a (tax) lawyer. I am not any kind of financial adviser. I am an electrical engineer.  To you, I am also a random person on the internet.  This post contains my opinions on the matter - which the IRS might agree or disagree. Use this information as you might - but, I ***would recommend*** that you verify the information in your own manner.\n\nThe TL;DR summary:\n\n1. It is easy to determine if a SPAC is **not** a PFIC - look at the S-1 filing to state an US incorporation\n2. Form 8621 reporting is **not required** if you held a (potential) PFIC for less than 30 days\n3. Otherwise Form 8621 reporting **is required** \\- there are 3 methods: QEF, mark-to-market, excess distribution.\n   1. You have to fill an individual Form 8621 for *each* PFIC\n   2. Requires paper filing\n   3. These methods are listed in increasing tax burden (ie. excess distribution is the most punitive) - however more information is required to decrease the tax burden\n4. If you bought a PFIC position and completely sold this PFIC position in a single tax year (ie. held the position in 2020 only), then you still have to do a Form 8621, but it is simply an excess distribution that is taxed as ordinary gains (or losses)\n5. If you cross a tax year boundary, then you need to make a timely election (QEF or MTM) to avoid punitive taxation at the highest marginally rate plus interest.\n\nI have nearly completed a program that will fill a Form 8621 for each of my PFICs based (search the SEC reports, categorize my holding, generate the completed form).  I plan to pay someone to review my forms, but I figure if I can do the leg work of filling these forms, then (hopefully) it will cost less.\n\nI hope to fully show in detail how I came to each of these conclusions.  Again - don't take my word - verify for yourself!\n\nFirst thing that I noticed in my study.  There are several postings online that discuss PFICs and how to file.  The tax code in regards to PFIC was updated in 2018 and several of the online posts pre-date this change.  The tax code change in 2018 mostly dealt with insurance companies, so in general it didn't change the impact on PFIC SPACs - however, I had to double check the tax code prior to 2018 with the latest version.\n\nLinks to the primary sources of information:\n\n* [Tax Code Section 1.1291-1298](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1291-0)\n* [IRS instructions for Form 8621](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621)\n* [Hodgen Law Blog (Multiple) Posts on PFICs](https://hodgen.com/category/pfic-and-cfcs/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContinue if you dare .... :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. It is easy to determine if a SPAC is** not **a PFIC - look at the S-1 filing to state an US incorporation**\n\nSimple process to determine if a SPAC is not a PFIC.  Go to [SEC Report](https://sec.report/) ; find the S-1 filing and search for the location of incorporation.  If this location is in the US, then the SPAC is not a PFIC, otherwise it *possibly* will be considered a PFIC.  If you are only checking a few tickers, then going to the web site is not too timely of a process to check.  However, I had a large enough list that I create a program to check these tickers for me.  Time permitting, I can check other tickers for folks - right now I'm only working on the one that I held in 2020.\n\nNo need to repeat the things that could or could not make a non-US incorporated SPAC a PFIC - this was discussed in detail around the new year in this sub.\n\nMy plan of attack for my 2020 tax filings is to assume any non-US SPAC is a PFIC and hope to be pleasantly surprised if any are not.  I emailed the investor relations for each of my non-US SPACs to see if they thought they would be a PFIC.  It's only been 10 days, but only 2 SPACs replied back: CRHC said they will be considered a PFIC but expect to be exempt via the \"start-up exemption\".  FTOC said they will be considered a PFIC but *will not* be exempt via the \"start-up exemption\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Form 8621 reporting is** not required **if you held a (potential) PFIC for less than 30 days**\n\nAccording to paragraph (c)(7) of [Section 1298-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1298-1):\n\n    (7) Exception for certain short-term ownership of PFIC stock. A shareholder is not \n    required under section 1298(f) and these regulations to file Form 8621 (or successor\n     form) with respect to a section 1291 fund (as defined in \u00a7 1.1291-1(b)(2)(v)) for a\n     taxable year when the shareholder -\n    \n    (i) Acquires the section 1291 fund in the taxable year or the immediately preceding \n    taxable year;\n    \n    (ii) Is a shareholder of the section 1291 fund for a total of 30 days or less during\n     the period beginning 29 days before the first day of the shareholder's taxable year\n     and ending 29 days after the close of the shareholder's taxable year; and\n    \n    (iii) Is not treated as receiving an excess distribution (within the meaning of \n    section 1291(b)) with respect to the section 1291 fund, including any gain \n    recognized that is treated as an excess distribution under section 1291(a)(2) as a\n     result of the disposition of the section 1291 fund.\n\nIn particular, line (ii) says that if you had the PFIC shares for 30 days or less, then you are not required to fill a 8621 Form.  \n\nFor the 2020 tax filing purposes, if you own a PFIC for 30 days or less between December 2, 2019 through January 29, 2021, then you do not need to submit the form.  Notice that it wraps around the tax year boundaries.\n\nThis means that if you bought a SPAC in the last week of December that might be a PFIC, then you could sell the position on Monday and remove your 8621 Form requirement.\n\nThere is another benefit of this exception clause - if you take on shares of a non-US incorporated SPAC and sell within 30 days, then you will not need to fill out a 8621 Form.  (Again, I am not a tax advisor, so this is an opinion on my reading of this language)\n\nNote, this interpretation is repeated by others: [here](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/people-organisation/publications/assets/pwc-united-states-pfic-guidance-provides-new-reporting-exceptions.pdf) [here](https://www.taxesforexpats.com/articles/expat-tax-rules/requirement-to-file-informational-return-form-8621-even-if-below-filing-thresholds.html) [here](https://virtualtaxusa.com/tax-tips/requirement-to-file-informational-return-form-8621-even-if-below-filing-thresholds/) [here](https://www.taxconnections.com/taxblog/final-regulations-clarify-exceptions-to-pfic-reporting/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Otherwise Form 8621 reporting** is required **- there are 3 methods: QEF, mark-to-market, excess distribution.**\n\n1. You have to fill an individual Form 8621 for *each* PFIC\n2. Requires paper filing\n3. These methods are listed in increasing tax burden (ie. excess distribution is the most punitive) - however more information is required to decrease the tax burden\n\nThe default taxation is excess distribution ([link](https://hodgen.com/pfic-excess-distribution-rules-same-year/)).  This needs to be avoided as you will be taxed at the highest marginal rate (regardless of your true tax bracket) and you have to pay deferred interest.  \n\nThe best method to prevent an excess distribution is to make a \"timely election\" to either the QEF or mark-to-market (MTM).  Also, opening and closing your position in a single tax year can avoid the punitive taxation.\n\nA timely election means that you fill the Form 8621 by time your tax filing is due in the first year of PFIC ownership.  I will focus on a MTM as it seems the easiest. It also requires less information than doing a QEF.  \n\nDepending on your tax situation, you might want to do the QEF since it can reduce your tax burden further; however, the PFIC needs to provide correct information to you in a timely manner. Both of which might not happen and might be in error and apparently it is hard to remove the taint of filling the Form 8621 incorrectly. \n\nQuoting from ([link](https://hodgen.com/pfic-excess-distribution-rules-same-year/)) again\n\n&gt; OK. Remember that. When you sell your PFIC stock, your gain is an \u201cexcess distribution\u201d and taxed as such, until you can find a reason to have it taxed in some other way. \n\n... we are trying to find some other reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. If you bought a PFIC position and completely sold this PFIC position in a single tax year (ie. held the position in 2020 only), then you still have to do a Form 8621, but it is simply an excess distribution that is taxed as ordinary gains (or losses)**\n\nGiven that most plays on a SPAC involve a short-term holding, this will hopefully be the clause that applies to most in this sub.  The assumption is that the holding was longer than 30 days and contained within a single tax year. \n\nFrom the Form 8621 Instructions [here](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621):\n\n    Portions of an excess distribution are treated differently. The portions allocated\n     to the days in the current tax year and the shareholder's tax years in its holding\n     period before the foreign corporation qualified as a PFIC (pre-PFIC years) are \n    taxed as ordinary income. The portions allocated to the days in the shareholder's \n    tax years (other than the current tax year) in its holding period when the foreign \n    corporation was a PFIC are not included in income, but are subject to the separate \n    tax and interest charge set forth in section 1291(c).\n\nThe second sentence says that the excess distribution in the current tax year is taxed as ordinary income.\n\nBut what about the separate tax and interest in Section 1291(c) - last sentence.  Okay, go to [Section 1291](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1291).  Paragraph (c) basically says to aggregate the tax increase from 1291(a)(1) by current tax year and prior to current tax year - very circular, but the point is that if you only hold the PFIC in the current tax year, then there is not additional taxation.  Again this [link](https://hodgen.com/pfic-excess-distribution-rules-same-year/) probably describes this point better, but I wanted to go through the Tax Code to convince myself (you should too!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. If you cross a tax year boundary, then you need to make a timely election (QEF or MTM) to avoid punitive taxation at the highest marginally rate plus interest.**\n\nThis topic deals with when you hold a PFIC across tax year boundary.  I am going to assume that 2020 was the first tax year in the position (because that is the case for me).  If you crossed the 2019/2020 tax boundary and you didn't submit a Form 8621 (correctly) with your 2019 return, then you likely have a headache ahead of you.  I am also planning to do a MTM as it requires the least amount of information.\n\nYou are not able to make a MTM on all PFICs - however, for SPACs traded on a market, you can do a MTM ... so pretty much anything considered in this sub.\n\nA mark-to-market election operates as if you sold you position on Dec 31st at 11:59pm and then immediately bought the position back on Jan 1st at 12:00 am.  **It is a pretend transaction**.  Effectively you are taxed on your position gains (or losses) that occurs in the current tax year relative to your adjusted cost basis.  In position year 1 the adjusted cost basis is simply your cost basis to open the position.  After the first MTM election, the cost basis is adjusted to the share price of the \"pretend buy back\".\n\nFor example, I bought AACQ for $10.02. The end-of-year close of AACQ was $10.63.  My MTM will show that I had a $0.61/share gain in 2020 which goes into the \"other income\" line of my return.  My adjusted cost basis on AACQ is now $10.63 for 2021.  I must track this adjustment - the $0.61/share gain is called the \"unreversed inclusions\".\n\nNow two outcomes can occur in 2021 when I sell AACQ - it will be either lower than $10.63 or higher than $10.63!  \n\nIf I sell higher than $10.63, then on my 2021 tax return, I must complete another Form 8621 where my gains will be taxed as ordinary in excess of $10.63.  Again, not an excess distribution because I will perform a timely MTM election of AACQ in 2020.\n\nIf I sell lower than $10.63, then we need to look at paragraph (c)(4) of [Section 1296-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1296-1)\n\n    (4) Character of loss -\n    \n    (i) Losses not in excess of unreversed inclusions. Any mark to market loss allowed \n    as a deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and any loss on the sale or \n    other disposition of section 1296 stock, to the extent that such loss does not \n    exceed the unreversed inclusions attributable to such stock, shall be treated as an \n    ordinary loss, deductible in computing adjusted gross income.\n    \n    (ii) Losses in excess of unreversed inclusions. Any loss recognized on the sale or \n    other disposition of section 1296 stock in excess of any prior unreversed inclusions\n     will be subject to the rules generally applicable to losses provided elsewhere in\n     the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. \n\nThe loss needs to first account for the unreversed inclusions from the 2020 MTM.  Basically, if I sell below $10.63 but not less than $10.02, the unreversed inclusions will cover those losses - resulting in an ordinary loss.  ... effectively I am *reversing* the *inclusion* of the gains into my cost basis due to the pretend transaction from the 2020 MTM election.\n\nHowever, if I sell for loss under $10.02, then, first, the unreversed inclusions are wiped away ($10.63 going down to $10.02).  Then any additional losses below $10.02 is a capital loss.  The length of my holding will determine if it is short-term capital loss or long-term capital loss.\n\n [Section 1296-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1296-1) provides several examples that you can review - here is one, they are pretty good examples to help with the intuition:\n\n    Example 5. Long-term capital loss treatment of losses in excess of unreversed inclusions.\n    The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that A sells his FX stock for $900. \n    At the time of A's sale of the FX stock on December 1, 2006, A's unreversed \n    inclusions with respect to the FX stock are $200. Accordingly, the $300 loss \n    recognized by A on the disposition is treated as an ordinary loss to the extent of \n    his unreversed inclusions ($200). The amount of the loss in excess of A's unreversed\n     inclusions ($100) will be treated as a long-term capital loss because A's holding\n     period in the FC stock for non-PFIC purposes was more than one year.\n\nOne aspect that can become tricky is when several purchases and sells occur at different dates and prices.  You must provide the accounting of these lots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Open issues in my research:***\n\nOption contracts - [Section 1298(a)(4)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1298)\n\n    (4)Options\n    To the extent provided in regulations, if any person has an option to acquire stock,\n     such stock shall be considered as owned by such person. For purposes of this \n    paragraph, an option to acquire such an option, and each one of a series of such \n    options, shall be considered as an option to acquire such stock.\n\nIMHO, the statement \"an option to acquire stock\" covers warrants and long call contracts.  Short call, short put, and long put does not give you the *option to acquire*; even though assignment of a short put will give you shares.  I will likely just treat this statement as a blanket on all option contract types.  But that is simply my unqualified assessment.\n\nAnother topic that I cannot quite resolve - *what happens when the merge occurs?*  For example CCH was a non-US incorporated SPAC that became UTZ (incorporated in US).  \n\nSay I bought CCH for $11, the last market price of CCH was $18 (just making up a number) and then I sold UTZ in December for $20.  Ultimately the realized gain in 2020 is $9 - which will be taxed as ordinary income.  However, do I fill a form 8621 and MTM the gain from $11 to $18 - then my adjusted basis for selling UTZ is $18 for a gain of another $2?  OR, does the fact that CCH via UTZ is no longer PFIC?  This is the last issue that I am trying to determine.\n\n**Closing thoughts (finally!):**\n\n* I don't think we need to be afraid of PFIC-possible SPACs\n   * It is not guaranteed that a non US-SPAC is a PFIC\n* If you hold a non-US SPAC for less than 30 days, then nothing special is required\n* If you hold a non-US SPAC only in one tax year, then the Form 8621 is 'easy'\n\nIf you made it to this point, then great and thanks for reading!

        "selftext": "This SPAC has not garnered much hype after DA was announced on 30 Nov last year. Now that we are in Q1 of 2021 and approaching the merger date in roughly 2 months time, the share price has been steadily advancing. I think that the current share price of $12.6 still presents a rather good risk-return profile in the short term to enter, mainly riding on the green energy wave. I have presented 2 plays for this SPAC at the bottom of this DD.\n\nMost have downplayed this SPAC due to its high valuation of $1.6B for just being a window company (non-EV) especially in a period where commercial real estate is taking a hit due to the pandemic. But I think precisely this is a good time to invest for the long term before the next boom. We might also have overlooked certain secular trends in motion that can provide some serious tailwind for this company. Now taking a deep dive into the company:\n\n# The Product\n\n&gt;\"View is the market leader in next-generation smart windows that use artificial intelligence and machine learning which will tint the glass to optimize natural light while controlling heat and glare, effectively eliminating the need for blinds/shades in the room. The smart glass enhances mental and physical well-being for occupants, creating smart connected buildings which reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\"\n\nBasically, they are the next-era windows maker for smart buildings. Think of your standard run-of-the-mill window glass panes. If you live in a tropical climate or countries with high sunlight hours, you would know that having a window seat in the noon is extremely uncomfortable and glaring. Even if the the blinds/shades were drawn down, the air-conditioning will still have to work extra hard to maintain the same room temp. By doing so, the building's energy consumption is higher = higher green house emission.\n\n*Processing img kz6m8gsggqa61...*\n\nWhat if you had a smart dynamic glass installed which will automatically tint the windows by tracking the Sun's trajectory? Aside from the glare protection from the tinting, the temperature in the room is also effectively maintained by blocking out solar heat, so the HVAC does not have to work overtime. What if this glass panel can also act as a transparent HD display for a suite of immersive work experiences?\n\nThe building window glass market is huge, having a $120 billion TAM in North America alone, and $1.2 trillion TAM in global glass consumption. Smart buildings are perhaps the key to the future of urban planning, due to the push for green innovation in smart cities that has gained momentum and will continue to do so under Biden's administration.\n\n**ESG/Green Wave**\n\nBiden administration clean energy plan to tackle climate change resulted in the rally of green/energy stocks recently. Tailwind can be expected from the green wave for View Inc. since their dynamic glass will help buildings attain **LEED certification** to become more energy efficient with the growing requirements from regulators in US and rising importance of ESG globally. View Inc. can help buildings reduce overall energy consumption and green house emission through **20% reduction in HVAC &amp; lighting consumption, with 10% overall peak energy reduction**.\n\n# Analysis of Product\n\n**1) Suite of Services -** They are not just a smart windows maker, but essentially a tech play as well. They have launched their suite of services in 2020 to complement the Smart Glass, comprising:\n\n1. *View Net* \\- Provides bandwidth power and data network that is the backbone to an intelligent building platform\n2. *View Immersive Experience* \\- Transparent see-through HD display on the window that is fully interactive with touchscreen capabilities.\n3. *View Sense* \\- Modules that provide the ability to measure and optimise light, humidity, temperature, air quality that cater to the well-being of occupants inside the building.\n\n[Transparent HD Display with 5G Network](https://preview.redd.it/ejqf6ukreqa61.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11729adffcdff43f94f7349d4c5909bed32347e6)\n\nWhat I like about the product is that its very modular and customisable. For the basic package you can just have the dynamic smart glass installed, with just the tinting capabilities. However, the infrastructure for other capabilities is already installed after the initial set up, which customers can choose to add on different modules (e.g. sensors/displays) and customise it based on their needs. This effectively sets up for repeat businesses.\n\n**2) Longevity** \\-You may be wondering about the longevity of their smart windows, since functionality will never be given due consideration if the product is shitty and fails to withstand the weather/time/pressure. If the smart windows are treated like consumables with the need to replace/maintain every few years, it will never be scalable. You may hear it from the CEO himself on how their team initially conceptualise the product and build it around a fundamental principle in mind - longevity. Therefore, the lifespan is similar to standard window glass with over **40-50 years of lifespan**.\n\nVideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaF21GtUcg&amp;ab\\_channel=GreenBiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaF21GtUcg&amp;ab_channel=GreenBiz) (watch from 12:30 onwards)\n\n**3) Durability -** Another point about why View Inc. glass is more durable than than other dynamic smart windows is because they are using an **inorganic ceramic material** as the nano-coating layer instead of organic material, which is the current industry norm. Even though organic material is cheaper to engineer, resulting in a cheaper product for their end clients, but the coating will be degraded by the heat from the sun which will make it less durable over time.\n\n**4) Market share** \\- Currently, they are leading the market with over 80% market share. In terms of economic moat, they have over **1k patents** (600+ currently, 300+ filed). This is a proprietary tech and after 12 years of R&amp;D, I think that they will be able to fairly sustain a huge competitive advantage over many other competitors, and effectively creating a high barrier to entry for new entrants due to the sheer amount of patents they possess.\n\n**5) Pricing &amp; Revenue** \\- Current revenue as of 2020 stands at around $31m with over $560m in  backlog orders (LOI signed). Although their dynamic window glasses cost upward of 50% more than standard window glasses, I think it's a highly differentiated product in which building owners can eventually charge a premium on rental leases = resulting in higher leasing revenues for them. One success case story is Civica Cherry Creek, an office building in Denver has managed to achieve the highest weighted average rental rates out of any office buildings in Denver city after switching to View's glass.\n\nOf course, I anticipate a huge inertia in the beginning where the mass market will put up resistance to adopt this product. However, overtime, combining the economies of scale in their factories to bring down production costs (higher gross margins) and rising demand globally arising from a proven track record, I can foresee exponential growth for this company in the long term. They are expecting revenue growths to be around 127% CAGR over the next 5 years, which I personally think it's possible but the exponential growth will not happen till 2023 onwards, since they need the initial two years for market entry into more markets/sectors.\n\n6) **Investors** \\- Early prominent VC funding include Corning and Softbank. However, I wish to point out that in recent SEC filings, **GIC Investment** (*Singapore state-owned sovereign fund, owned by the Government of Singapore*) initiated a 10% stake of $50 million in CFII last week, and an additional $200m PIPE investment today. Let me tell you why I'm so bullish about this. Singapore is a highly developed and urbanised country located in South-east Asia with a myriad of high-rise buildings/skyscrapers, tropical climate with plenty of sun activity all year round. Although N.A market is huge, but usually buildings in states with most sunlight activity e.g. California/Arizona will constitute the main bulk of customers. Let's imagine if the product is able to break into the Asia market, or even into South-east Asia with tropical climate zones, the revenues would be insane. GIC obviously conducted their DD as they won't screw around with state-owned money. They know the growth potential of this proprietary tech once this hits the market big time, and perhaps even a business arrangement to bring this product into Singapore? Other players will likely not stand a chance, with the exception of China.\n\n7) **Ability to scale**:\n\n* Current projects are only in the commercial space which has taken a huge hit due to the pandemic. With the ongoing trend in WFH, the residential market is essentially a cash cow for milking, especially against the backdrop of demand for healthy home working environment. In light of this, the CEO said in an interview that he has **already completed 50 residential projects** (this wasn't published as it's still in the works) and he is developing a product for residential market **this year** to target contemporary homes. LINK: [https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/view](https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/view) (from 10:45 onwards). The convergence of WFH trend and smart homes will definitely be a huge play, even more so than commercial. Does it reminds you of Netflix's Black Mirror? Transparent displays are certainly a sight to behold.\n\n*Processing img 908m94rkeqa61...*\n\n* Given the ubiquitous applications with glass, possibilities are not limited to just smart buildings. In fact, one really strong partnership with great potential would be to license the proprietary tech to EV car makers. **Incredible synergy can be found in the future of electric vehicle glass display**, where car window panels can function as a smart display with vehicle integration + auto tinting capabilities. In fact, the **entire transportation industry** could be disrupted by this tech, think of your Buses/Rails/Subway/Cruises and how smart glass display could reinvent the future of Advertisements in commercial transportation, and how fast would they jump on this bandwagon if they are able to monetise this new piece of glass.\n* Other uses across different sectors include the **hospitality industry** (airports, hotels, resorts) and **healthcare sector**, like hospital wards windows.\n\nFYI, they have piloted their product in 3 different US airports, namely SFO, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Boston airports.  After retrofitting their Smart Glass in the airports, results were rather stellar with an actual increase in concessionary sales, energy cost savings, as well as longer dwell time in such areas.\n\nCase study for DFO airport: [https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/dfw-airport-dynamic-glass-pilot-research-study\\_0.pdf](https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/dfw-airport-dynamic-glass-pilot-research-study_0.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear Case/Downsides**\n\n* Glassdoor rating of company seems poor with management woes at the executive level, and there were reports of View Inc laying off their staff sometime in April 2020. I think that internal turmoil would be detrimental and could impede their growth in the future.\n* Current earnings of $31m in 2020 does not really justify the valuation of $1.6b (much speculation is on future growth potential).\n* They have a current minimum order of $1M, which will not sit well with smaller commercial buildings or residential market. This will result in them losing market share gradually to their smaller competitors who can cater to such clientele.\n* The biggest risk to their Intellectual Property is that it is not universal i.e. it does not have an international protection. Patents are territory rights, so even though their tech is protected in US, I expect proliferation of copy cats in other countries like \\*coughs\\* China. They may register for IP in China as well, but let's face it, its not exactly fool-proof and Chinese companies operate differently in China. Although there will be imitations, but I believe that View's level of R&amp;D is extremely strong after 12 years in operation. Other copy-cat Smart Glass companies would unlikely be able to achieve the same level of product as View, thus ensuring levels of product differentiation.\n\n**The Play**\n\nWith the merger expected to complete by Q1 of 2021 (2 months time), I expect CFII to pop closer to merger date based on the lifecycle of SPAC companies, perhaps in the $14-$15 range. But once it reaches ATH right before merger, it will probably be a good time to sell, as once post-merger happens and downside cap is removed, it will most likely fall below $10 or even lower as the industry is very CAPEX- intensive. In addition, I think that the commercial space is likely to remain sluggish in the near term, which will push the price further down. It will also likely burn more cash in the process, since you have to bear in mind that any new futuristic tech adoption is an extremely long and arduous process.\n\nRevolutionary tech like iPhones/Tesla did not pick up from the get-go after it was introduced to the market, and it took several years before they saw some real results. This is probably a good time to accumulate your positions while its being massively hated on, and believe in the conviction that 1) they are the market leader with a wide economic moat, &gt;1k patents and ability to scale up while bringing down costs. 2) secular ESG trend with Biden's green plan will provide good tailwind for the sector at least for the next 4+ years, in which their policies will likely benefit the industry. 3) multiple uses applications are HUGE with amazing potential for licensing/partnership plays in EV/hospitality/healthcare sectors. I have strong conviction in the long term that it is going to be a multi-bagger if you keep accumulating the dips post-merger.\n\n**TLDR**: In short, buy now for the pre-merger pop and sell right before merger. Following a post-merger sell-off, accumulate on the dip and ride on for the long term in the next few years.\n\n*Positions: Warrants @ $2.4*\n\nLink to investor presentation: [https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/View-Investor-Presentation-High.pdf](https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/View-Investor-Presentation-High.pdf)",

        "selftext": "I'm no investing expert, but I listened to those who are and here are some conclusions (please correct me where I'm wrong).\n\n- With current frothy market valuations we have less expected future returns from the market. That's just maths. (The higher the asset is valued, the less future return you can expect from it)\n\n- In recent interview **Charlie Munger** says next decade we will be getting **lower returns**. **Ray Dalio** shared similar view.\n\n- If **hyperinflation** happens (unlikely, but some conspiracy theorists do claim it can be the case) stocks might rise against USD, but purchasing power will fall, so stock investors will still be left behind.\n\n- Investing in speculative SPACS, TSLA valuations, TikTok/Youtube investing channels, Robbinghood WSB gamblers, margin traders: all symptoms of an ecstatic market. Could go on for a few years still, but overall these are signs or overheated market.\n\nLost decades have happened before and surely will happen again and time is about right. (What would magically make this time different?) \n\nBut how do we **PROTECT** ourselves against this and even **THRIVE** during a lost decade?\n\nI assume we have no ability to time the market (good for you if you have).\n\nOne conclusion is **DIVERSIFICATION**.\n\nBut apart from a **diversified total world stock index**, where can we put our money?\n\n- **Bonds?** The yields are low and if yields are increased bond indices will fall.\n\n- **Real estate?** Yes, real estate will indeed keep up with inflation, but it is not that easy to purchase for average investor, not liquid and also has risks like increased taxes, amortisation, upkeep, geopolitical risk for people living in potential warzones, etc...\n\n- **Gold?** Not an income producing asset. Maybe 5% of portfolio?\n\n- **Bitcoin.** Also not an income producing asset, but makes more sense than gold. But again, normally you would invest 5% MAX in something so speculative.\n\n- **Cash?** Will be eaten up by inflation. Pretty much losing money by doing nothing.\n\n- **Value stocks?** Probably the answer, since historically statistically value stocks have returned more than growth stocks (yes it sounds like a paradox, but statistics prove it). Relevant video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt_CvL3k\n\n- Here is **THE PROBLEM** if you want to invest in value stocks. You have to have ability to pick them. But why go through all the learning if you can just outsource it to Warren Buffett and buy Berkshire Hathaway?\n\nOne reason might be that you have **advantage** over Berkshire Hathaway by being able to pick value stocks in **smaller market cap markets** which are inaccessible to BRK due to their size.\n\nProblem is  - due to **information abundance** value investing strategies are **public information** and therefore already **priced in** at least partially. As a value investor in 2020 you have less chances of outperforming the market compared to value investor in 1950s. Any dude in slums of India can watch Sven Carlin, read intelligent investor and decide to become a value investor, so there are serious doubts that average, common investor from reddit will be able to outperform.\n\nThere are a few more reasons to consider Berkshire: by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger passing away in next decade most people assume Berkshire will suffer, but in fact, I think the **OPPOSITE** will happen: **Berkshire will PUMP**.\n\nBecause markets do **the opposite** of what normies think will happen.\n\nWarren Buffett dies -&gt; Berkshire repurchase their stock -&gt; normies realise that the Berkshire can function very well without WB and that his knowledge has been fully passed on to those in charge -&gt; normies rush into Berkshire. Berkshire outperforms S&amp;P during next decade.\n\nRealistic or stupid?\n\n**TL:DR version:** Value stocks historically return more than growth stocks and since lately value has been lagging behind and since we are bad stock pickers, shouldn't we just buy Berkshire Hathaway?\n\nWhat am I missing? What other options do normal investors have? I'm not talking about billionaires who can buy sports teams and so on, but normal people on reddit.",

        "selftext": "Sup Folks, Fred here with another post on spacs. Seen we have a lot of new members in this community, it's time to in depth explain, what a spac is, and why companies are using spacs to go public ( en mass ) these days.\n\nFor a more in depth analysis with examples check out my video on this topic :\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR0JIu9vWFtA5l2Y3jZe4GPCo3id0S5s99xWLquDQXCWzC86UxdXwZEcjU4&amp;v=OaW1FMhIL24&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR0JIu9vWFtA5l2Y3jZe4GPCo3id0S5s99xWLquDQXCWzC86UxdXwZEcjU4&amp;v=OaW1FMhIL24&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nIn Summary :\n\nCatalyst Number one : Virus Strikes in Feb 2020. very bad time to be alive as a growing company right. --&gt; private investors don't want to invest in new opportunities, they want to preserve current portfolio's = only logic. so March/ april 2020, the private market dried up. No money there for companies. **Alternative : going public**\n\nWays to go public:\n\n*( note here : In my opinion, the more options, a company has, the better market we will have, as companies can make an educated decision on how to go public. They can chose the way of going public that would benefit them the most )*\n\n**1) Standard IPO--&gt;**lengthy process 18 months + high cost basis )\n\n**2) Direct listing--&gt;** lengthy process 18 months + company evaluates themselves + low cost basis)\n\n**3) Spac --&gt;** Fast process ( 4-6 months on average + accurate valuations + high cost basis )\n\n**4) reverse merger** ( we will leave this as is , as it's not a frequently used mechanism )\n\n**Why are we seeing more spacs on the market, and why are more and more comapnies choosing spacs to go public?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**General spac construction :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jk42lovm70b61.png?width=1574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47a3e13945b46b5e3b05064a52c8d94a16e56a5c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sponsors advantages ( pipe &amp; spac )**\n\nSimple :\n\n* The people setting up these spacs \" the sponsors \", make millions of dollars of a company going public through their spac, regardless of the company doing well afterwards ( despac timeframe )\n* More and more quality companies, are choosing spacs to go public, due to covid cash flow issues. It's a neccesity for them to survive, these investor are jumping on them, because they see the potential.\n* Unlike a traditional ipo process, the sponsors can set up meetings with the boards of these companies and educate themselves on the exact value this company offers and what their future plans include. **Companies can pitch their forward projections and investors can look into and evaluate them= key**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Company going public through a spac advantages**\n\nSimple:\n\n* Like mentioned earlier : fast process with correct valuations.\n* These meetings with spac boards, are also beneficial for them. --&gt; they can see who is running the spac ( **MANAGEMENT OF A SPAC IS KEY**), what is the history and field of expertise of the guys running the spac, are they well connected in the sector, can they possibly guide us ,to what we, as a company want to achieve in the future.                                                                                                       *note --&gt; most of the time 1 or 2 guys of the spac board will come onto the board of the new company to guide them futurewise. So the target company wants to have top notch guys in a specific industry on their board.*\n* They get a lot of cash both from the spac as from the pipe ( see picture above ), result is always a de-spaced company with a lot of cash on the balance = key for future growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion : Since March/ April 2020, more and more companies are choosing the spac way as it saves them from a lenghty and costly ipo process. More and more investors are willing to put in money into spacs, as they see quality companies choosing for spacs as the way to go public. Spacs will remain popular in the years following, the only thing that can stop us from making money is bad companies going public through a spac ( For example, Jeffrey's hotdog stand, valuated at 1.5 billion ) , the sec will in turn try to intervene and regulate this market, so let's hope we avoid the nikolas of this world and make more bank.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Markets face a big week of news, with stimulus at the top of the list  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/markets-face-a-big-week-of-news-with-stimulus-at-the-top-of-the-list.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets will stay laser-focused on the prospect for more fiscal stimulus in the busy week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Politics and politicians are likely to continue dominating the headlines, as Democrats seek President Donald Trump\u2019s removal after a mob of his followers took over the Capitol Building on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; But it is stimulus that should get the most attention from investors, who are betting the new Democratic majority in Congress will move quickly and that it could consider a package of $1 trillion or more.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose to record highs in the past week, boosted in large part by the idea of a bigger stimulus package.\n*****\n&gt; With Democrats now in control of the Senate and House, the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden is expected to deliver an even bigger stimulus package than had been expected with a divided Congress. Biden said Friday the total will be in \u201cthe trillions of dollars.\u201d The election Tuesday of two Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, shifted control of the Senate to Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; While disturbing, the temporary assault on the Capitol Building did not ruffle markets, and the removal of Trump is not expected to receive enough Republican support to succeed with just days remaining in his term. Biden is scheduled to be sworn in on Jan. 20.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is willing to look through that chaos, but not through this anticipation of faster and bigger stimulus,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings, data ahead\nIn the normal business of markets, fourth-quarter earnings season begins with the rollout of big banks\u2019 reports Friday, when JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on tap. There is also a long list of Fed speakers including Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled for a webcast from Princeton University Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, CPI inflation data is released Wednesday and December\u2019s retail sales are reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index will be important, and although it is expected to show muted inflation, markets have begun to price in rising expectations in the bond market. One bond market inflation measure, the 10-year breakeven, went as high as 2.1% Thursday, meaning investors expect that to be the average level of inflation over the next 10 years.\n*****\n&gt; But strategists said little will matter but stimulus, which economists expect will ease the impact of the surging virus on the economy. The U.S. reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid in one day for the first time Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market may also begin to pause as soon as the coming week, as the virus surge continues and investors worry vaccines are being too slowly deployed,\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou feel like this recovery rally is going to run out of legs,\u201d Hogan said. He said that with the S&amp;P 500 up about 16% since Nov. 4, investors may begin to think it is getting ahead of itself.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat could be next week\u2019s business to contemplate. You\u2019re likely to take some sort of breather,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said there\u2019s a level on the S&amp;P 500 that could be a turning point for the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,824 Friday, up 18% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a chance we could be hitting 3,900 and that\u2019s a key level for markets,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThat\u2019s the level where people are looking for a local top. That\u2019s a level where we could be repelled. It\u2019s a number where if we blast through it, it would be good but if we don\u2019t break through it, it could start the correction. It\u2019s a binary risk.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But even if there is a pullback, Lee expects the S&amp;P 500 to reach 4,300 by year end. \u201cI think what the stock market is saying is we\u2019re going to get a really good economy this year,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season should be a positive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUncertainty has plagued everyone, so the certainty that comes with earnings is good for stocks,\u201d said Lee.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/C0LIthO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/naBACT7.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3qF2U4y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WfEELCq.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUvCcqT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/99vHejZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ABV4hoR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OWCbndT.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/PrdtNkQ8/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/sfYjV27r/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/hv1cMCcj/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Cyclicals Climb, Defensives Decline\n\n&gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, cyclical sectors are leading the way higher in 2021 as Energy, Materials, and Financials are all up around 5% or more compared to the S&amp;P 500's gain of a more modest 1.65% YTD. That outperformance has led to some sharp moves in the relative strength lines of several sectors. As shown below, the Materials sector and Financials have both seen sharp moves higher in their relative strength lines versus the S&amp;P 500. For Materials, this has been part of a broader trend of outperformance (upward trending line) that has been in place over the past year. For Financials, prior to this most recent upswing, the line first began to trend higher in the late Fall but then took some pause in December. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Health Care, and Industrials have also made moves higher, albeit more modest than those of Materials and Financials.\n\n&gt; As for the other sectors' relative strength lines, there have been some sharp moves in the opposite direction. Starting with what had been market leaders at various points of the past year, Communication Services and Technology are perhaps some of the most notable negative reversals. For the former, the relative strength line has generally moved sideways over the past year, but since mid-December, the line has been on the decline with one of the most dramatic legs lower taking place in the past week. Tech was a consistent outperformer in the first half of 2020, but since the summer that outperformance has faltered. The sector's relative strength line peaked and has been trending sideways since the start of September and the move so far in 2021 has brought the line down towards the low end of the past few months' range. As for other sectors, Real Estate, Utilities, and Consumer Staples have been trending lower for the better portion of the past year, but with cyclical sectors flying, the relative strength lines of these more defensive sectors have made new lows this week in dramatic fashion.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-RS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sector Breadth Strong\n\n&gt; Several measures of market breadth have been showing strength recently as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. Over 80% of S&amp;P 500 stocks trade above their 50-DMAs, more than half are overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA), and over 20% of S&amp;P 500 stocks reached new 52-week highs yesterday. Additionally, shorter-term breadth as measured by the 10-day advance-decline line has also been strong. Pretty much across the board, every sector's 10-day A/D line has tipped into overbought levels. That doesn't apply to only Consumer Staples and Real Estate which have more modest readings, though breadth for these sectors has still been positive recently. At the moment, Materials, Health Care, and Financials are the most overbought sectors by this measure. Overall, the sharp moves higher in the 10-day A/D lines does flash a warning sign for the very near term that things are running a bit hot.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-10-day-AD.png))**\n\n&gt; As previously mentioned, several sectors are reaching new 52-week highs, and given breadth has been strong to match, cumulative advance-decline lines are confirming the moves higher. As shown in the charts below, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Industrials, Materials, as well as the broader S&amp;P 500 all closed at 52-week highs last week and so too did those sectors\u2019 cumulative A/D lines. While price did not close at new highs, Tech, Financials, and Communication Services also all saw new highs in their cumulative AD lines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-cumulative-breadth.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Off to Strong Start to 2021\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Russell 3,000 is already up 5.24% year-to-date after just four trading days. And to think, major indices were down ~1% on the first trading day of the year this past Monday. Below we highlight the average YTD performance of stocks by sector in the Russell 3,000. Remember, the Russell 3,000 contains large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps, and it covers roughly 98.5% of all US-traded market cap. As shown, Energy stocks have jumped out to the strongest start to the year with an average gain of 13.26%. Materials rank second with a gain of 9.1%, and then Industrials, Financials, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary are all bunched together with gains between 5% and 6%. Technology stocks -- last year's big leaders -- are 'only' up 4.34% on average so far in 2021, while the Real Estate sector is the only one that has averaged declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/sectorsavg.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at Industry Groups, while Technology as a whole is underperforming a bit, the Semiconductor group (which are part of the Tech sector) is up big with average YTD gains of 9.4%. Autos are also performing very well with a gain of 9.2%. Thank you Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/r3kgroups.png))**\n\n&gt; There are already more than 600 stocks in the Russell 3,000 that are up more than 10% year-to-date. That represents 20% of the index.\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the top-performing stocks so far in 2021. Usually, it takes weeks or months to see YTD gains like these, but we've gotten here in just four trading days. 3D Systems (DDD) ranks first with a gain of 119%, followed by Atomera (ATOM) at 70%, ViewRay (VRAY) at 59.5%, Arcturus (ARCT) at 54%, and Akerna (KERN) at 52%. We don't fault you if you have never heard of these names!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/beststocksytd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Equity Winners and Losers in 2020\n\n&gt; 2020 was a good year for stock investors despite unprecedented challenges.\n\n&gt; After being down more than 30% at the March 2020 lows, the S&amp;P 500 Index ended the year with a solid 18.4% total return. Last year marked the first time the index ended a year positive after being down at least 30% during that year. Gains were driven primarily by the emerging economic recovery taking hold, bolstered by massive stimulus, and the remarkably fast COVID-19 vaccine development that encouraged market participants to begin to price in the end of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; We take a look at some of the asset class and sector winners and losers in 2020.\n\n&gt; Massive growth outperformance. The growth style of investing had one of its biggest runs ever relative to the value style in 2020, benefiting from better positioning for the pandemic, superior earnings growth, and balance sheet strength. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the major growth indexes returned over 30% while the value indexes produced mid-single-digit gains. The technology sector was the biggest driver of growth outperformance (about 60% of it), but the consumer discretionary sector\u2014led by Amazon, one of the biggest stay-at-home stocks\u2014also outperformed the broad markets and value indexes by a wide margin last year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical January Trading: Mixed Results since 2000\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s mixed market performance with mega-cap tech shares declining while other major indexes moving higher is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. The only difference is it has usually been tech moving higher while other areas of the market retreated. Since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a0a002cdd46e852712841fbd1688c132/24a9987a98ef15dd-ec/s500x750/ba4983415f1eddedf6687d8d793c86b9c732f497.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xqhdHaoXUw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NXQuP7o.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WjsRkdd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qrT91FG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/O2aSUyP.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mitgWeG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xWZfXGx.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vplnuuc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oCqgrUS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qKlnVyr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mfw4byl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "Greetings to all who read this,\n\ntoday I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**\n\nIntro to QS: \" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*\n\n\u00b7 Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)\n\n\u00b7 Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)\n\n* \u201cQS Stock Risk:\n\nThis stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be \"very high risk\". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.\n\nOur recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.\"**\n\n\u00b7 Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.\n\n\u00b7 Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.\n\n\u00b7 Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u00b7 More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).\n\n\u00b7 We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.\n\n\u00b7 While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \\-- approximately $808 million.\n\n\u00b7  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.\n\n\u00b7 Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that \"subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.\"\n\n\u00b7 While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.\n\n\u00b7 Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.\n\n\u00b7 The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*\n\n## \u00b7Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants\n\n\u00b7 Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants \u201cwill become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*\n\n\u00b7 Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.\n\n* Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms.\n* Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares.

This is what I found:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* NEW YORK, Jan. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxinmXVVLrJDxKXZ51kUy069jt6KYCVWfxv-xmrrVleGnnjI41ZIjHtVkE7V1tBU-F7u6qoBkkbZq2k4sxaA3WGwbEZTD6Y14D4iXLD4nmgqDb) announces that it has commenced an investigation of QuantumScape Corporation (\u201cQuantumScape\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: QS) on behalf of investors concerning the Company\u2019s possible violations of federal securities laws.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* On January 4, 2021, *Seeking Alpha* published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape\u2019s solid state batteries that make it *\u201ccompletely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.\u201d* Specifically, it stated that the battery\u2019s power means it \u201c*will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving.\u201d* As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive, *\u201cthe power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower.\u201d*\n\nOn this news, the Company\u2019s stock price fell almost 40% during intraday trading on January 4, 2021.\n\n[**Wolf Haldenstein**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxilkDLpHhrmI0w9pWxLiwZxzgbfa0LW6wu-ssajWNDjgU-zgz7CpsCaXj9SXd2mcPUg==) has extensive experience in the prosecution of securities class actions and derivative litigation in state and federal trial and appellate courts across the country. The firm has attorneys in various practice areas and offices in New York, Chicago and San Diego. The reputation and expertise of this firm in shareholder and other class litigation has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have appointed it to major positions in complex securities multi-district and consolidated litigation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* MILWAUKEE, Jan. 4, 2021 /Newswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating possible securities fraud claims against QuantumScape (NASDAQ: QS) resulting from inaccurate statements QuantumScape made regarding its business operations and prospects.\n\nClick here to learn more about the investigation: [http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3025642-1&amp;h=1038669832&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).\n\nThe investigation focuses on whether QuantumScape properly disclosed the significant limitations of its solid-state battery products in order to be acceptable for real world field electric vehicle performance. Specifically, according to a Seeking Alpha research report, QuantumScape's solid state battery products (i) last only for \"260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving\", (ii) have a daily range of only about \"75-100 miles at full capacity in winter temperature conditions\", (iii) will charge only to 5% in 15 minutes rather than 80% at 15 minutes in winter conditions, and (iv) will have an energy density lower than competitors.\n\nIf you wish to obtain additional information or have information about this investigation of Splunk, please contact X....\n\n[http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3025642-1&amp;h=1038669832&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).\n\n**Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:**\n\n[https://archive.vn/Thdc8](https://archive.vn/Thdc8)\n\nFor anyone willing to dive deep enough, I recommend having a look through their patent applications on Google Patents here: [https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1)\n\nAlso, a quick Google Scholar search on solid-state lithium batteries, should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there. Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.\n\nI also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, check out r/QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Tl;dr:\n\n* Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future.\n* But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.\n* Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.\n* There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.\n* People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.\n* In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.\n* Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to c.b.a.t (mods have banned because of market cap), another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause c.b.a.t to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \\~$9. I am personally going long both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYours truly,\n\nNathMcLovin!",

        "selftext": "First, at the top, for those of us here who can't read... TSLA  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nOkay, I need you guys to listen, and listen good because I am going to go over a lot of already known public information about TSLA that somehow the gummy bears here keep forgetting, or just are not accounting for.\n\nTSLA is more than a car business, it's more than a solar power company, and it's more than a tech company.  TSLA has the absolute best long term solution for solar power roofing on the market right now when factoring in maintenance costs, power bill savings, and all installation.  Clean energy over the next few years is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in general because of the movements the USA will make in order to promote clean energy as a country, and the world as a whole will follow.  This means that there will be lots of new properties being built with solar panels, and there will be lots of people who are doing roof repairs swapping to solar panels.  TSLA already has factories in multiple countries, and has the infrastructure to quickly scale up to meet demand, which we have seen back with their model 3 production ramp up, and now with their massive funding, they should be able to do so much more effectively this time than the last.  TSLA will make a lot of money this year, next year, and onward off of their solar panels alone, and they will likely sell very well with the 25 year TSLA warranty in conseration.\n\nSolar market recap/summary:\n\nTSLA has the best solution, competitive pricing for premium roofing, and long term performance because of the 25 year warranty.\n\nTSLA has factories in most of the world already, and is able to scale up really fast in order to meet rapid demand as the demonstrated with the model 3.\n\nNow, that's just the beginning, FSD will have a massive impact when they achieve it because they will no longer be taking market share just from the car industry, but also from uber/lyft/grubhub, etc.  Elon has said before that they want to eventually have enough cars in production to roll out FSD taxi's.  They said initially, they will leave the steering wheel for user override, with the intention of eventually having enough of the roads being self driving cars, and the software being mature enough to remove the steering wheel (we'll see about it, I'm not one to go against papa Elon, but I don't know if people would be okay with that in the next 5 years +).  Elon also said in the same conference, that he wants to allow existing Tesla owners to be able to lend their cars back to Tesla to let them be a part of the FSD taxi service with all profits going to the owner of the car instead of Tesla, which will give them a faster ramp up time in every area because Teslas are popular enough, and the need for extra income is always there, like you retards know.  \n\nSo, to summarize all of this, Tesla isn't a car company, or a solar company, or whatever kind you can think of because Tesla is really just something we haven't seen before, and it will continue to grow, and amaze us in how much of the world they will be able to profit off of.\n\nThis is also why we don't need to worry so much about Tesla competitors in this sense because they are so far ahead of the curve that they aren't playing in a fair fight.  Tesla is done with cars, papa Elon wants to get to a point where nobody owns a car, and everyone uses the Tesla-Express.  This will cripple the insurance business for individual car insurance, since only people who own cars will need it.\n\nThis post is getting long, and so I won't get into all the other upsides of their batteries, and charging stations, but I will say that the upside is just as massive.\n\nGranted, at a certain point papa Elon said this robo-taxi would be ready in 2020+, I would expect it to be ready numbers wise 2022-2023, and infrastructure, and regulation hurdles in production 2024-2025.  I am not saying that TSLA will be uphill constantly on this trip, and that there is not a bubble, but what I am saying is that all of those things accounted for, the entire upside of the company, in terms of it's impact to the world, and how much the world will eventually rely on it, the price is far under where it will be, and this will be competing in the same scale as Amazon within no time (relatively speaking).\n\nTLDR:\n\nTSLA has massive unaccounted for potential on their robo-taxi, and solar roofing future, and even if we are in a bubble, TSLA will eventually be a name everyone knows by name because they own, or use one of their products.  TSLA \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will get better at writing these, I need my IQ to drop a bit more from WSB before I can get some real quality out.\n\nThanks guys.\n\nSources:  \n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1249210220200550405?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1249210220200550405%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\\_&amp;ref\\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caranddriver.com%2Fnews%2Fa32159871%2Ftesla-robo-taxis-still-coming-2020%2F](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1249210220200550405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1249210220200550405%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caranddriver.com%2Fnews%2Fa32159871%2Ftesla-robo-taxis-still-coming-2020%2F)  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1nDnnv\\_Og](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1nDnnv_Og)",

It's a company called CPS Technologies and their main product is AlSiC, which is a proprietary patent protected component that goes into transportation vehicles (electric/hybrid), wind turbines, aerospace products (YES EVEN NASA IS USING THIS FOR THEIR MARS ROVER) and army vehicles/armors, etc. \n\n**Below is what's used for transportations:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wrooyxn07b61.png?width=1075&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0d3e1ef0e8ca49a3acc89515f0bed83ea9f6d7d\n\n**This is for wind turbines:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1f2djjp07b61.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7880aa1b1c8cf1672be6aa4154ecf9d50c8dcf78\n\n**Automotive**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qrso43r07b61.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=249fb3680eb85b5dcb8ec52f8b802537ebaa46ad\n\n**Aerospace:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfysj0gt07b61.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d181c424e3c0c013d15661063788e22e45a42e12\n\n**Armor:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0evzyrv07b61.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e24943ba9991c4d80cbb0ac81d19c798ea6539c9\n\n**Defense electronics:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1rsshdx07b61.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3578727f59cce2d7d47e973773ac0ecdfeca59ae\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the list goes on and on... all this to say, this stock might actually be a jackpot. It's literally the key supplier that's plugged into the entire $2 trillion market ecosystem boost that's about to happen. I almost see this as an ETF of its own plugged into so many different industries and applications that'll moon under Biden's administration. This also has gotten the attention of Deadnsyde ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-EvW57Xoo&amp;ab\\_channel=Deadnsyde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-EvW57Xoo&amp;ab_channel=Deadnsyde)) which builds even more credibility. \n\nIt has gone up a bit but this has much more room to run. Combined with tomorrow's announcement, I can see this easily hitting $20-30 in the near term, and even higher by eoy. \n\nFor those wondering, here are the financials:\n\n* No debt\n* Positive operating profit (unlike some of those penny stocks that are bleeding money every year and have poor financials)\n* Taken from Q3 2020 results transcript: \" Today, we announced revenues of $4.5 million and an operating profit of $253,000 for the quarter ended September 26, 2020.\"\n* What's shocking is that their full year revenue was struck heavily by COVID AND two of their major customers experiencing black swan situations but they STILL experienced positive growth compared to 2019. \n\nDon't miss this chance guys.

Outlook for AXP: AMEX is becoming more and more aggressive with its sales tactics to coerce business owners into accepting their product while at the same time sticking to its modus operandi of charging 50% higher merchant fees than its competitors Visa and Mastercard on the basis that AMEX cardholders are perceived as affluent. According to American Express, AMEX cardholders average 60% higher income than non-AMEX cardholders. This statistic is probably skewed by the fact that Warren Buffet has been carrying an AMEX card since 1964.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!With e-commerce and alternative payment options on the rise, physical charge cards are going to become a thing of the past. Amex's business model which revolves almost entirely around collecting merchant fees is on shaky grounds.  TLDR: Boomer stock, no thanks.

        "selftext": "First, to reduce any confusion, the company will be referred to as Papa John's and the person will be referred to as Schnatter.\n\nI was joking about the idea to take over Papa John's with some of my friends yesterday to get Schnatter back in control of his company, and when I started doing my research I actually liked what I saw purely from an investment standpoint. This post will have two main parts: how we can get Schnatter his job back and also how we can easily make money on PZZA. We'll do the money stuff first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chart**\n\nAs of writing this, PZZA is currently trading at $94.10 and the ATH is $102.25. It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH. It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average, so there is no resistance until ATH. This is great for options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6klbqs2u4a61.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a797b3678678bd167818ee455dcde4d49f6e4512\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, I suspect that PZZA could be forming a cup and handle pattern. If this plays out, the price target would be (ATH + (ATH - Bottom of Cup)), which is about $131.38. However, we won't know if this is a cup and handle until it happens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umhvpr1ou4a61.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b468ffd791469758f0679d390c4b6d72cad01a35\n\nEven if the pattern fails, a delivery pizza restaurant is a pretty safe place for your money to be during the pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other Numbers**\n\n[Target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PZZA/research-ratings) of $104.50 with a high of $116.00. I think this is low going off the chart.\n\n[31 million shares](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) float. I know that's a lot, but Schnatter already owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile).\n\nGuys, it's take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company, which should help PZZA stock even more. As you will see, ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position.\n\n**Why Schnatter Left**\n\nIn 2017, he made a controversial comment about how the [NFL player protests were hurting Papa John's sales](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/22/572779230/papa-johns-ceo-steps-down-following-controversial-remarks-on-nfl) because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. I don't want this to get political, but this is essential to talk about. Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors. Fast forward into 2018, where Schnatter was reported to have [used a racial slur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/?sh=376e4e6e4cfc) in a meeting and it was recorded. Then, he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company (besides for shareholder).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Schnatter's Fight for Innocence**\n\nEver since both of these allegations have surfaced, Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA) Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast (I know many people don't care for them, myself included, but those opinions don't change what Schnatter says in the interview) where he explained why both allegations were false. Regarding the NFL drama, Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue. [His exact words were,](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/ex-fbi-director-clears-papa-johns-founder-of-racial-bias-slams-clearly-inaccurate-media) \"*The NFL is hurting, and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner\u2019s satisfaction, NFL leadership has hurt Papa John\u2019s shareholders.\"* In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur, former FBI director Louis Freeh, wrote a [report](https://papajohnschnatter.report/read-the-report) where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur, he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism, and when he said the word, he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him. There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released. The first part includes him using the slur and the context, and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how \"they got him\" and they needed to get it to the press right away. This is all according to the H3 interview. It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him, and the company seems intent on keeping it secret, showing that they are likely hiding something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sales are Slumping**\n\n[Sales are decreasing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221441/papa-johns-total-revenue/#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20Papa%20John's%20worldwide%202007%2D2019&amp;text=American%20pizza%20restaurant%20franchise%20Papa,seeing%20a%20decline%20in%20revenue) every year since his role as been minimized. It's as simple as that. They are in no way a failing company, they are just making less money than they were.\n\n*Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61...*\n\nIn addition to slumping sales, in the [H3 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA), Schnatter claims that Papa John's total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased. He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality. In my personal experience, I can say the quality at my local Papa John's has decreased over the past couple years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why Schnatter Can Fix This**\n\nSchnatter is more devoted to Papa John's than most CEOs (after Karp and Elon), even though he technically doesn't work for them anymore. As I said before, he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants. The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales. Who else still puts effort into a company after they've been fired from it? Also, this is just speculation, but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What we can do**\n\nIt's simple, buy shares! If we buy enough shares of PZZA, we (along with Schnatter) can become the majority shareholder of the company. There are [just over 31 million shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) and Schnatter still owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile), or 3.88% of the company. If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again, we can easily call a shareholder meeting, vote out those who wrongly accused him, and put him, back in charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Historical Implications**\n\nSchnatter has long been touting \"The Day of Reckoning\" but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened, if it is multiple events, or what it will be specifically. If we can accomplish this, WSB would go down in history (it already has) again for giving a man his company back... and we will make money in the process. We can be the day of reckoning!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is This Legal?**\n\nYes, it is perfectly legal. This would technically be a hostile takeover, which is legal, but we can just call it something else. Besides, I'm pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nPZZA chart shows easy money, Schnatter is innocent of accusations, only he can bring Papa John's back to its former glory, and we can be the ones to do that. The Day of Reckoning is here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPZZA PLTR GME SPCE ICLN TSLA \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso if I misspelled \"Schnatter\" anywhere I'm sorry.",

This is not a new emerging company. SolarMax has been around 2008, they\u2019re not gonna get much better than $15m of sales a quarter. And that\u2019s if they\u2019re not faking those sales by shipping stuff from China to sell back to the same company that sold it to them in China. \n\n-according to this filing, ALAC only has $15m left in the trust https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1748621/000121390020035974/f10q0920_albertonacq.htm\n\n-How the f is this company valued anywhere near $300m??????\n\nThis SPAC is riding on nothing but green energy hype IMO it\u2019s full of red flags. I\u2019d be surprised if this stock even holds at $10 after merger let alone $14.90\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to hold ALAC thru the merger, all I can say is best of luck to you and this link might come in handy later: https://www.rl-legal.com/cases-alberton-acquisition-corporation\n\nTLDR: SolarMax fired its own CFO for uncovering faking sales and abusing the EB5 immigration program.\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t have any positions in ALAC. This is not investment advice.",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019m not sure to flair this as DD or discussion as I\u2019m not sure myself, first time posting here.\n\nI know this stock hasn\u2019t been talked about for some time here, but I\u2019d like to know your opinions.\n\nAtm I might be drunk so definitely ask for clarification. Shoot it down ifI\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m ok with that. Failure is part of the learning process.\n\nAt the moment it\u2019s pretty clear that the ARM deal, as the P/E of 115 would suggest, probably in a relatively rational market is one of the few things that would justify its current value. \n\nAnd as some of us would know from a few months ago, this deal can\u2019t go through without the approval of the Chinese and Europeans, the biggest being of course the Chinese.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know why the takeover is a big deal: ARM is a British company who controls the biggest share of patents on IP cores: \u201ca reusable unit of logic, cell or integrated circuit layout design\u201d acoording to Wikipedia, so they\u2019re makig their revenue by selling their patented chip designs, thus being integral to a huge part of the semiconductor industry. \n\nWhat people fear is that this would mean a near-monopoly in this semi-conductor industry by Nvidia: e.g. ARM delivers around 90% of the smartphone chips. Given the fact that Nvidia is trying to grow in the data centre and AI development sectors, ARM is pivotal in this. It would be like getting a scientist in Civilization V: a huge boost in comparison to their competitors, of which INTL consistently underperforms and AMD is still not yet on the level if it comes to GPU\u2019s.\n\n\nGiven the fact this would give Nvidia a lot of power in China: ARM has a joint venture in China and being a US company they might not trust this deal carries a big risk. Even though Softbank, ARM and Nvidia were confident that this deal would go through the 18-month paperwork that is this takeover, but since Jack Ma has been gone missing, things might look different.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people here saying it\u2019s the CCP being butthurt, but I\u2019ve got a different view of it, and I thought it was the Washington Post that thought the same: the CCP wakes up to the danger that the big tech and data companies provide as they present a enormous threat to their power. Being dependent on Western technology and Biden still willing to continue the hard line (albeit in a more subtle way) of Trump towards China the stance towards US companies doesn\u2019t change. The stance of the CCP towards tech companies in general might. And thus the initially already unsure deal becomes even more unsure, as the Brits fear that the takeover will lose jobs and knowledge in their country. \n\nI\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on this: how has the Jack Ma incident changed the CCP\u2019s stance on technology? And how does it affect the Western companies? There might still change a lot in the temaining 15 months but I myself do expect a harder line towards Western tech companies in China. I\u2019d love to hear your arguments against and for.\n\nBull case: I\u2019d say they\u2019re leading in some very potential big industries and they are very able to convert that lead: the competition is still far away. With ARM they will consolidate this.\n\nBear case: When looking at the P/E it\u2019s overvalued and potential upside is priced in and it seems that due to the wait of the approval the stock atm is going sideways, and there might be resistance against the deal. I\u2019ve not mentioned it earlier but also the Europeans don\u2019t seem too happy with this, not to mention China which I did mention.\n\nI hope you\u2019ve become any wiser of this, questions or sources do ask.\n\nFor those who ask positions I\u2019ve been owning 2 shares since June/July bc I\u2019m poor.",

We serve industries, energy and gas companies with leading hydrogen technology. Our roots date back to 1927, and since then, we have had a proud history of  development and continuous improvement of hydrogen technologies. Today, our hydrogen solutions cover the entire value chain from hydrogen production technologies to  hydrogen fuelling stations, enabling industries to transition to green hydrogen, and providing all fuel cell electric vehicles with the same fast fuelling and long range as fossil-fuelled vehicles \u2013 without the emissions.\n\n**Why am I interested?**\n\n2020 has been an accelerant to the move into greener, more sustainable energy. EU wants to be carbon neutral by 2050, China by 2060 and soon the US (once Biden is in power) will also want to be carbon neutral by 2050 + Biden\u2019s $2 trillion infrastructure and renewable energy plan.\n\nMost people believe that battery power is the future. In my opinion it is, but not on its own. Current battery tech is limited often in range, we are in the works of inventing new types of battery (Look at Quantumscope) however, before they are commercially available on large scale, cost efficient is still years away.\n\nHydrogen is nothing new. Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements on planet earth meaning access to this type of renewable energy is basically infinite. By using electrolysis, Hydrogen can be produced from water and renewable energy. However, green hydrogen is becoming more and more affordable to produce, meaning that start to finish no CO2 is emitted and we are nearing in this decade large scale green hydrogen production.\n\nMultiple projects have been started in the EU over the last two years and I believe this trend will continue on, also in line with carbon neutral plans of at least two large nations in the world.\n\nApplications for hydrogen are very broad\n\n\\- Industrial use (Examples: oil refining, ammonia production, steel production)\n\n\\- Transportation (Limited low carbon fuel available as present; Hydrogen opportunity// Fuel cell costs also important)\n\n\\- Buildings (replacing natural gas, direct use for boilers or fuel cells)\n\n\\- Power generation (leading for storing renewable energy; can be used to increase power system flexibility; ammonia can be applied in coal power plants to reduce emission)\n\n**Why Nel ASA?**\n\nQ3 Highlights\n\n* a screenshot of Q3 ER presentation should be here, but not allowed to add image\\*\n\n\\- World\u2019s largest electrolyser company.\n\n\\- \u20ac242 million cash (enough to cover R&amp;D and burn rate).\n\n\\- Excellent group management with experts from varied industries.\n\n\\- 3-Yr revenue growth 74.05% // 5-yr 112.19%.\n\n\\- Revenue has improved YoY since 2014, not yet profitable but close too.\n\n\\- Entered MoU with Iberdrola to develop green hydrogen plant in spain.

Operational 2023.\n\nIt is not necessarily a play which seems safe at the moment, as financials are not positive yet, however are improving, I am holding this stock till at least 2025. They also have enough cash to cover operations. In the annual report they do mention that once they are in a position to pay dividend they will, however that is not the play here. I have been vested in this company for over a year and I strongly believe in it. The company is growing steady, more and more projects in the backlog, awarded multiple government grants over the last 6 months. It is a renewable energy play for the coming decade (imo)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost Recent Contract:\n\n\\- EverFuel Contract for Fredericia Hydrogen project \u2013 20MW electrolyser to be delivered in 2021 and fully operational mid-2022.

        "selftext": "Hi r/securityanalysis, I am trying to become better at researching investment ideas and here is a piece I recently put together. I would love some feedback and a discussion on your thoughts on it. \n\n**The Situation and Company Background**\n\nAffirm is a leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) provider that allows consumers to have the flexibility to pay for their purchase over a period of 6 weeks to 48 months with merchants that have added Affirm as a payment option. The company is expected to trade under the ticker \u201cAFRM\u201d and start trading next Wednesday with price talk around $38/share, which equates to an equity value of around $9.2B. This is a severely lower valuation than other fintech peers such as Afterpay, Square, and Shopify. We believe that AFRM should be valued at least $20B to $30B using a conservative FY23 EV/Sales total company comp of 13x compared to Afterpay at 18.3x, SHOP at 28.1x, and Visa and Mastercard around 16x. \n\nThe company mainly operates in the United States, and as of September 30th, has already partnered with over 6,500 merchants and has 3.9M active consumers but recently acquired PayBright, a Canadian based BNPL provider. Affirm generates most of their revenue through fees charged to merchants when a customer uses the BNPL option at checkout. Additionally, the company generates revenue through simple interest charged to consumers that have chosen to extend their payment options beyond the interest-free payment length. Merchant fees range from 2 \u2013 3% while APR ranges from 0 \u2013 30%. Additionally, the company earns fees through customers who utilize a virtual debit card, gains on loans sold to third-party investors, and servicing fees on loans managed by Affirm. \n\nIn FY20 (June end), Affirm saw +92.7% revenue growth to $509.5M, with $256.8M in merchant network revenue (50.4% of revenue) and $186.7M in interest income (36.6% of revenue). Additionally, active customers grew +76.9% to 3.62M active users and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew +77.0% to $4.6B. We note that Affirm is currently reliant on one merchant, Peloton (PTON) for their revenue as the partner accounted for 28% of FY20 revenue and the top 10 merchants accounted for 35% of revenue. \n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\nWe believe that Affirm will be the dominant BNPL provider in the future in the United States that will benefit from increasing usage of BNPL at checkout. We anticipate Affirm\u2019s recent partnerships with e-commerce platform Shopify (SHOP) and payment company Adyen (ADYEN.AS) will help drive a flywheel effect to allow Affirm to establish itself as the dominant BNPL provider in the United States as both platforms will help bring additional merchants and consumers onto the platform. We expect the Shopify partnership to help capture a differentiated market that is underserved compared to competitors Afterpay and Klarna. With the addition of Shopify, hundreds of thousands of vendors can now add a BNPL option seamlessly which will allow Affirm take market share, which will further drive the flywheel effect. \n\nWe also believe that Affirm provides a better product suite than competitors from the perspective of both the merchant and consumer. Affirm\u2019s product provides more flexibility on payment term length compared to its competitors, offers virtual debit cards to allow consumers to use Affirm at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm, and a no fee and competitive high-yield savings account. Additionally, Affirm charges substantially lower merchant fees. Together, we believe merchants are more likely to choose Affirm when deciding on which BNPL company to implement, which will further compound the desirability of implementing Affirm as their consumer and merchant base grows.  \n\nFinally, we anticipate Affirm to serve a Millennial, Gen Z, and Gen X population that has not adopted credit card usage like their older generations. Their generations are more accustomed to online shopping and utilizing digital payments but have built a distrust in traditional credit due to seeing their older friends and family negatively impacted during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n**Comparable Company Analysis and Valuation**\n\n[Comp Sheet](https://imgur.com/CLgDfsK) Source: Factset, and [Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) indicate a fair value of $20B to $30B equity value compared to IPO pricing of around $9.2B. This is another severely underpriced IPO that is poised to pop on the first day of trading. \n\n**Buy Now Pay Later Background**\nAffirm offers a new alternative way that people can transact. Consumers have been utilizing different methods to trade for goods and services since the dawn of man. Transactions have originally started through bartering for different items and goods and evolved into using coins made from precious metals as accepted methods of payment. In a more modern world, we have moved to utilizing paper currency and coinage, and more recently, into credit/debit and digital wallets. The way people shop has also significantly evolved throughout time. Gone are the days merchants carried their wares across different towns. Although we still have outdoor markets much like Greek agoras in 1,000 B.C., we have evolved in the way we pay for goods and services at markets. Local stores and department stores, which dominated the way consumers shopped in the 19th and 20th century, are in a decline. Now, we are entering a new period in how consumers shop; online. With this revolution, we can see continued shifts and advancement in the way people pay and we believe the \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d option is the innovation that has the potential to upend the traditional credit/debit card market.\n\nAffirm will become the second largest publicly traded BNPL provider, behind Australia\u2019s Afterpay. The BNPL payment option is an alternative way for a consumer to pay for product by providing flexibility regarding payment terms and is a point-of-sale (POS) loan.  Although the BNPL payment method is still miniscule compared to traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, accounting for approximately 1% of e-comm sales in 2019, Worldpay\u2019s 2020 Global Payments report expects penetration to increase 3x to 3% of e-comm sales utilizing BNPL by 2023. In EMEA, the payment method is already more established and accounted for 6% of 2019 e-comm payments and Worldpay expects it to reach ~10% penetration by 2023. Market research company eMarketer estimated that U.S. consumers spent $590B on e-comm in 2019. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the first 3 quarters of 2020 had 16.3% of retail sales ex-auto penetration through e-comm, compared to 12.5% in the same period LY, and e-comm dollars spent grew +34.2%. With the pandemic reshaping how consumers shop and accelerating the growth of e-comm sales usage and spending, we believe that BNPL usage could potentially beat Worldpay\u2019s estimates. \n\nAnother key piece for Affirm\u2019s success relates to their credit risk model. Unlike a traditional credit card where a consumer is approved for a credit limit at the time of application, Affirm provides a credit limit in addition to analyzing risk at the transaction level and can approve/reject purchases at the time of purchase. The company\u2019s risk model has allowed them to approve 20% more customers compared to other competitors while still limiting delinquency and default rates. Additionally, their 36-month delinquency rate is more than 50% lower than the credit card industry average of 2.5%, with a rate of 1.1%. We also estimate that AFRM\u2019s net charge-off rates are also about 50% lower than industry average, ending FY20 with 1.8% of loans charged off compared to the credit card industry average of 3.7% in the same period. Although traditional credit card companies can lower a consumer\u2019s credit limit at any point in time, they are often slow to react as their algorithms rely on antiquated methods such as credit scores, transaction history, and credit usage. This indicates credit card algorithms are utilizing data that could be older than a month to make credit risk decision. Affirm\u2019s proprietary risk model has brought the credit risk model into modern times with real-time economic data in addition to SKU level data to assess risk more advantageously and at a transactional level.\n\n**Why Affirm?**\n\nAlthough Affirm is not the only BNPL provider in the U.S. and was not the first provider, we believe that Affirm\u2019s product suite is superior compared to competitors such as Afterpay and Klarna. Currently, Afterpay only lets consumers split their purchase into 4 interest free payments split in 2-week intervals across 4 payments, spreading payments across 6-weeks. Klarna\u2019s product is essentially identical. Affirm allows consumers to split their purchases monthly for up to 48 months, with most interest free periods ranging up to 12 months. Additionally, we believe Affirm is more compelling for the retailer to utilize because the merchant fees charged are substantially lower (2 \u2013 3%) vs. Afterpay (3 \u2013 6%) and Klarna (up to 5.99%). Affirm also offers a virtual debit card, which lets you use your Affirm account to pay at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm as their chosen BNPL provider. \n\n[Affirm vs. Competitors](https://imgur.com/tVivw6t) Source: Company websites\n\n**How Can Affirm Continue to Grow and Improve?**\n\nAffirm is Still Missing Multiple Pieces to Become the Dominant BNPL Provider. Although we are bullish on Affirm\u2019s long-term prospects and impressed with their current progress, we believe there is still room to improve. We believe two key components of a dominating alternative payment company are still missing, and once implemented, can accelerate new user adoption. (1) Affirm needs to implement a rewards program, similar to traditional credit cards and Klarna\u2019s \u201cVibe\u201d rewards program. Affirm highlighted most of their users have the ability to pay for their purchase in full but prefer the financial flexibility of splitting payments. We believe Affirm\u2019s users are financially responsible consumers and may face hesitation to utilize the BNPL option vs. a credit card as there is no rewards/cash back offering at Affirm. We expect Affirm to offer a rewards program in the near future, which would impact profitability, but would help drive customer acquisition in the long-term. (2) A physical card that allows the user to utilize Affirm\u2019s BNPL option in retail stores could help drive additional GMV growth. The card would be programmed to follow the merchant\u2019s current agreement and timeframe of repayment that the merchant and Affirm have already agreed too. However, if the card is used at a non-partner merchant, AFRM would allow the card to be used as a 0% APR credit card with repayment term lengths determined by their proprietary credit risk model. Recall that a credit card was used to pay in 40% of in-store transactions, and we believe a physical card can help complete AFRM\u2019s product suite. We also believe the card can help bring Affirm on equal footing with competitors that have partnered with substantially more merchants as consumers can use the Affirm card online with any merchant.\n\n**The Bears**\n\nAffirm is in a distant third place with 3.9M active users in the U.S. as of September 30, 2020, trailing Afterpay\u2019s 6.5M active U.S. customers and Klarna\u2019s 10M customers in the same period. Additionally, Affirm currently has 6.5k active U.S. merchant partnerships compared to Afterpay\u2019s 13.9k U.S. partnerships and Klarna\u2019s 235k+ global partners. Lastly, Affirm lags both competitors in GMV. Affirm saw $5.3B in TTM GMV compared to Afterpay\u2019s $11.1B AUD and Klarna\u2019s $35B+ USD from January to September 2020.  We do highlight that Affirm is the leader in average GMV/customer at $1,359 compared to Afterpay at $991 and Klarna at $412, which we believe is due to high exposure to PTON and other higher-AOV retailers.\n\nAffirm is still heavily reliant on Peloton (PTON), but we believe they have a symbiotic relationship. PTON offers Affirm as an option to finance equipment at 0% APR for up to 39 months. Our field checks and PTON\u2019s 10-K indicate that substantial portion of PTON equipment purchases are financed through AFRM. AFRM also disclosed that 28% of FY20 revenue came from their PTON partnership. A big critique of AFRM\u2019s business model is that they are too reliant on one merchant for their revenue. We believe that this could pose a risk in the intermediate future, but analysts expect PTON\u2019s performance through FY2021 (June 30-end) to remain strong. PTON recently reported an explosive 1Q (Sept-30 end) with +233% revenue growth but +281% growth in their connected fitness segment, which is the segment that recognizes sales of their Peloton Bike. \n\n[PTON Connected Fitness Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/734f82O) Source: FactSet and PTON\n\n**Still Undervalued Excluding PTON**\n[Still valued at $22B excluding PTON revenue](https://imgur.com/M5aoT3p) Source: My estimates from backing out PTON revenue contribution\n\n**Valuation**\n\nWe use a blended valuation to arrive to a $94 implied value/share, which provides +147% upside to the high end of the IPO price talk of $33 to $38/share. Our valuation is based on a 75%/25% blend of a multiples-based analysis on FY2023E and a DCF model. Our EV/sales analysis assigns a 16x multiple on merchant network revenue, 12x multiple on interest income revenue, and a 2x multiple on servicing income, virtual card revenue, and gain on sale of loans. This provides a total company EV/sales multiple of 13x FY23 estimates. This is lower than APT\u2019s 18.3x FY23 EV/sales multiple, which we believe is justified due to AFRM\u2019s revenue mix that is more concentrated towards interest income revenue, lower GMV, fewer active customers, and high reliance on one merchant. However, AFRM is a fast-growing alternative payment company that is growing share in a fast-growing industry, has strong partnerships that we believe will help drive growth long-term, and a strong leadership team with successful experience in the internet/payment space. For DCF, we use a WACC of 10.9%.\n\n[13x FY23 EV/Sales Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) Source: FactSet, and [10 Year DCF Analysis](https://imgur.com/dItAhab) Source: My estimates\n\n[Finally, a more conservative sensitivity table indicates ~$73 valuation with a very conservative EV/sales multiple and lower 3-year CAGR assumption.](https://imgur.com/4FAtFHA) Source: My estimates\n\nNote: All ideas are my own and I will be buying the IPO on Wednesday.

        "selftext": "Several years ago, I was first introduced to the idea of psychedelics for mental health because I followed the work of Jordan Peterson, author of the 12 Rules for Life book that was popular a year or two ago. Before listening to his segment about it, I like many others thought of psychedelics merely as a means to get really high and hope to have fun. I hadn't ever tried them.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MnqXlmLGuc&amp;ab\\_channel=TheArchangel911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MnqXlmLGuc&amp;ab_channel=TheArchangel911)\n\nI now have personal experience with Psilocybin. I'm curious how many on this reddit heard of psychedelics for mental health in a similar fashion, and/or how much of a crossover there is on this sector with those who are also familiar with the work of Peterson (or even the work of Carl Jung, from which Peterson draws much inspiration).\n\nIt seems to me like those interested in depth psychology and the contents of the subconscious are more prone to interest in the application of psychedelics. Your thoughts?",

        "selftext": " Here is a Google Doc link of a High Conviction Trade for an EV SPAC\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTv5eBc31GcavG7LfIu6hmwYWcQrtctRvWE9OntKDq99BW5RRLELh7gMf2IwkCqnt9kHj9MxKs0S9Ky/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTv5eBc31GcavG7LfIu6hmwYWcQrtctRvWE9OntKDq99BW5RRLELh7gMf2IwkCqnt9kHj9MxKs0S9Ky/pub)\n\nHere is a snippet of the trade report:\n\nCompany Overview\n\nGigCapital3 ($GIK) has entered into an agreement to merge with Lightning eMotors. Lightning eMotors manufactures powertrains, complete vehicles, and charging solutions for the zero-emission medium-duty commercial market. The company was founded in 2008 and has a manufacturing facility in Loveland, Colorado. There are already 120 vehicles on-road, 1500 vehicles on order. 100% of 2021 and the majority of 2022 are already contracted. They hold a 50% market share in[ class 3 to class 6](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tmguide/tmg_2013/images/figurec-1.jpg) electric vehicles. The ticker symbol will change to $ZEV (cool ticker symbol) upon merging which is set tentatively for mid-February, 2021.\n\nProduct and Business\n\n* All commercial vehicles are built in 2 stages - OEM \u2192 Upfitter (Upfitters are responsible for decking out the trucks based on customer\u2019s requirements. An ambulance truck\u2019s interiors are different from a telecom providers\u2019 truck) \u2192 Customer.\n* ZEV is in the business of manufacturing complete vehicles (based on chassis from OEMs), electrifying the existing fleet (this is basically removing the combustion engine and making it fully electric), charging stations, fleet management software, and financing the purchase orders.\n\nKeyPoints\n\n* A lot of interest has been towards companies like Hyliion, Rivian , Canoo, Arrival. Yes, they look really nice and sleek. But it presents a huge problem for fleet operators - The vehicles have not been tested to be able to depend on them and there is virtually no service partners or services network in the US. If a rearview mirror breaks down, it might take a week or more to receive them. Any downtime is loss of revenue for fleet operators. As ZEV orders its chassis from OEMs like GM, Ford, Hino, Isuzu, and Navistar, they are able to receive spare parts in a matter of hours if not days. Also, the warranty from OEMs carries over as well. This is a huge advantage that ZEV will have over other companies entering this space.\n* Last-mile fleets run 8 classes of vehicles from multiple OEMs (no OEM offers everything). ZEV is the only supplier today that has class 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and Fuel cell trucks/vans. Ford, Rivian, and Arrival have announced Class 2 EVs only. ZEV operates in a niche segment where it does not make business sense for OEMs to channel investments into. The Class 3 and above commercial segment is characterized by low volumes and diverse operational requirements.\n* ZEV can build/assemble about 15 Class 3 and 4 powertrains and vehicles per week right now on a single 8-hour shift. The coaches take a lot longer as they are much more complicated and not yet as automated (but much higher price). This production capacity only equates to less than 4K class 3 and class 4 vehicles. They need serious cash to be able to expand their manufacturing capacity to build 25k vehicles by 2025.\n* More eyeballs on the[ Amazon vehicles in San Diego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1KURWf74o&amp;feature=youtu.be) provided by ZEV. One should remember that Amazon will never be able to source their entire fleet from a sole operator including Rivian. The pie is big enough to be shared by several players in this space.\n\nRisks\n\n* Execution risk as they try to expand their manufacturing facility to 750,000 sq.ft which is only currently at 250,000 sq.ft.\n* GigCaptial3, the SPAC sponsor does not seem to be bringing anything valuable to the table. They seem to be really good at providing 'SPAC in a box' type service, which in this case is perfect for ZEV as they are basically looking for more cash infusion and do not have to worry about all financial and regulatory concerns in going public.\n* As more competitors enter the space in the next 2 to 3 years, it could be a little harder in differentiating.\n\nConclusion\n\nRead Google Doc for full conclusion please because the images are not loading properly on reddit when I copy and paste them over",

        "selftext": "Greetings to all who read this,\n\ntoday I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**\n\nIntro to QS: \" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*\n\n\u00b7 Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)\n\n\u00b7 Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)\n\n* \u201cQS Stock Risk:\n\nThis stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be \"very high risk\". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.\n\nOur recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.\"**\n\n\u00b7 Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.\n\n\u00b7 Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.\n\n\u00b7 Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u00b7 More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).\n\n\u00b7 We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.\n\n\u00b7 While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \\-- approximately $808 million.\n\n\u00b7  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.\n\n\u00b7 Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that \"subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.\"\n\n\u00b7 While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.\n\n\u00b7 Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.\n\n\u00b7 The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*\n\n## \u00b7Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants\n\n\u00b7 Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants \u201cwill become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*\n\n\u00b7 Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.\n\n* Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms.\n* Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares. Among the top 15 include the likes of:\n\n1. Porsche automobil Holding, with 19.56% ownership,\n2. Khosla Ventures LLC, with 9.76%,\n3. Capricorn Investment LLC, with 6.71%\n4. L. Doerr , with 5.59% and\n5. Jagdeep Singh with 4.84%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Next, I filtered through a Google search, focusing on news involving QS or its shareholders. This is what I found:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* NEW YORK, Jan. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxinmXVVLrJDxKXZ51kUy069jt6KYCVWfxv-xmrrVleGnnjI41ZIjHtVkE7V1tBU-F7u6qoBkkbZq2k4sxaA3WGwbEZTD6Y14D4iXLD4nmgqDb) announces that it has commenced an investigation of QuantumScape Corporation (\u201cQuantumScape\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: QS) on behalf of investors concerning the Company\u2019s possible violations of federal securities laws.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* On January 4, 2021, *Seeking Alpha* published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape\u2019s solid state batteries that make it *\u201ccompletely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.\u201d* Specifically, it stated that the battery\u2019s power means it \u201c*will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving.\u201d* As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive, *\u201cthe power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower.\u201d*\n\nOn this news, the Company\u2019s stock price fell almost 40% during intraday trading on January 4, 2021.\n\n[**Wolf Haldenstein**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxilkDLpHhrmI0w9pWxLiwZxzgbfa0LW6wu-ssajWNDjgU-zgz7CpsCaXj9SXd2mcPUg==) has extensive experience in the prosecution of securities class actions and derivative litigation in state and federal trial and appellate courts across the country.

Specifically, according to a Seeking Alpha research report, QuantumScape's solid state battery products (i) last only for \"260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving\", (ii) have a daily range of only about \"75-100 miles at full capacity in winter temperature conditions\", (iii) will charge only to 5% in 15 minutes rather than 80% at 15 minutes in winter conditions, and (iv) will have an energy density lower than competitors.\n\nIf you wish to obtain additional information or have information about this investigation of Splunk, please contact X....\n\n[http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3025642-1&amp;h=1038669832&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).\n\n**Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:**\n\n[https://archive.vn/Thdc8](https://archive.vn/Thdc8)\n\nFor anyone willing to dive deep enough, I recommend having a look through their patent applications on Google Patents here: [https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1)\n\nAlso, a quick Google Scholar search on solid-state lithium batteries, should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there. Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.\n\nI also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, check out r/QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Tl;dr:\n\n* Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future.\n* But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.\n* Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.\n* There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.\n* People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.\n* In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.\n* Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to CBAT, another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause CBAT to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \\~$9. I am personally going long both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYours truly,\n\nNathMcLovin!",

Whether you think it will or not. I made this post 4 days ago and got flamed. So I will post this again. Tomorrow will be the best time you have right now to pull investments. \n\nMillions will march on DC. Nobody in the market with a sane brain will think \"Oh I better take big positions!\"   \n\n\nPeople will only pull out money. Hopefully its a 1 day dip. But you dont know how far this goes. Best case scenario, you pull money and get to buy in at a discount.\n\nWorst case scenario, you pay a few fees. \n\nThank me later. \n\nHISTORY IS BEING MADE TOMORROW AND THE STOCK MARKET ISNT GOING UP. THIS IS SERIOUS. SAVE YOUR MONEY. PAY THE FEE IF IM WRONG. THANK ME IF IM RIGHT.",

He essentially says that that was just the beginning of the Internet revolution, then adds a layer to the complexity to the question whether the discussion is around short term or long term. His answer is essentially AI/tech/information revolution for the current bubble.\n\nHis sale of Arm to Nvidia seem to fit this vision. What do you think?",

It's my understanding that SBE is currently at 8 Bil. Market cap where it stands.  And I told him $100 would put the cap around 18 Bil.  I might be a little off these are just guestimates.  I know SBE will get alot of people burned.  But do you think it could pull a QS and hit 100 after merger before crashing down ? Or will this sucker tank like a rock on merger day?
