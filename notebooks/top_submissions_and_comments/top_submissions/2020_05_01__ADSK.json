        "selftext": "\\## **My history investing in college and my first month investing in February:**\n\nLearned about miners and blockchain validation with a chemical engineering friend before the rally.\n\n\\- Bought **XRP** at $.15 and $.25, sold at $3.28 (I valued at $4 or $5 dollars MAX in 10 years if blockchain found adoption)\n\n\\- Bought **AMD** after the rally at $11 because it was ridiculous how much cost efficiency they had introduced to the market to poor people like me unlike **NVIDIA** products which always seemed far removed and discouraged me.\n\n\\- I started with **Panasonic** because I had missed out on the window to invest in **Tesla** at 200-300 range. I believed **Panasonic** to be similar to **AMD's** relationship to **bitcoin**; while all eyes looked at the shiny object, I looked at the boring parts that built it.\n\n\\- The market crashed, so I DCA'd aggressively and controlled my emotions through out. I was more concerned with my performance to commitment rather than my returns at the time. I did well.\n\n\\- My investments in March 19 was **SQ** and **Lyft**\n\n\\## **My Strategy now that I have income**\n\n\\- I bought up to 5,000 dollars in stocks ranging from **FANUC** (industrial robotics) to **DENNYS** (logistics/real estate)\n\n\\- I trimmed down to $2,300 but will rapidly rebuild with a different approach:\n\n\\- I'm buying 1 stock in the company before making any further developments with. Following this, I will purchase ETFs in sectors that I **want** to see develop in the next 5-15 years. I will buy 1 stake into these ETFs and combine it with my 1 stock purchase to create the necessary offset.\n\n\\- For example, I bought 1 stock of **Texas Instruments**  for $109 followed by a purchase in **SOXX ETF** for semiconductors, which has the largest ETF allocation to **Texas Instruments.** I will apply similar logic to companies like **Facebook, Paypal,** etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I do this \"1 chip\" start in multiple industries because I want to pick some arbitrary point in time but I have a lot of industries &amp; ecosystems that I would like to reasonably participate in. This will still cost a lot of money to start off with and buys me time to study company numbers and outlooks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **My current market sentiment**\n\n**-** I consider where you start on a graph as somewhat arbitrary and see the current market stability as somewhat of an exercise in game theory and rowing a boat throat a thick fog. I believe it's optimal to row cautiously forward and to not stay still. With cautious rowing, you'll be able to react appropriately if you are suddenly met by a waterfall or a path with clearer vision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`*****BEARISH\\`*** on Amazon in the long term. I believe that slowly, but surely, the market will consume Amazon's hold on its markets. I don't believe Amazon will maintain the status quo on cloud computing due to the quality of its competitors. I absolutely LOVE **Google Cloud Platform** and utilize **Firebase real-time database** very often. **Microsoft** has made some extremely important acquisitions recently in **Github and NPM - that's enormous.**\n\n\\-  I have suspicions about **Amazon** will struggle internationally. I don't know if Amazon will penetrate China the way China does, or if it will succeed in locations south of Mexico against things like **Mercado Libre**\n\n\\- I have suspicions that tech platforms will soon integrate in a meaningful way with financials. As in, the virtualization of stores and forwarded payments in places like the **Facebook(Visa) Market Place, Twitter(Square) payment sending, Paypal(honey) &amp; Amazon purchasing, Gaming credits, etc.**\n\n**-** I am \\`**bullish**\\` on Facebook. Facebook is utterly invaluable and scales globally. The reason it's adopted in **Mexico**, for example, is because it's cheaper and faster than other services. They also service millions of developers with **React** and its growing development ecosystem. They provide a standardized marketting platform for small businesses on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and soon to be JIO. I would not be surprised if they soon enter the fintech sector.\n\n\\- I am \\`**bullish\\`** on **Paypal**. They are seemingly repeating their previous success by servicing large online commerce that are upgrading their systems. **Honey/Paypal** will scrape coupons for Amazon and force organizations like Visa to compete with  **real-time financial services**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`bullish\\`** on cloud software and networking. I think **CDNs** and dedicated **services for Cybersecurity** will maintain. Sure Google provides these services but things like **Cloudflare** and **Fastly** have dedicated solutions to fast image processing, DDoS protection, and more that other platforms may not be able to **allocate their resources to**. **Cloudflare** has an enormous network, and **Fastly** provides a great system for you to enjoy content like **Reddit.** I think it's hard to miss the mark here - the highway of the internet is going to get faster and more assets will be maintained in the server's space - the ecosystem must grow with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am ***\\`EXTREMELY BEARISH***\\*\\*\\`\\*\\* on Beyond Meat. I've been vegetarian for 10 years. IT'S BAD. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING ATTENTION. VEGETARIANS ARE LYING IF THEY SAY IT'S AMAZING. ***IT'S LITERALLY DOG FOOD***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am \\`**BULLISH\\`** on the long term development of **Mexico**. I think companies like **Kansas City Southern** that services **Mexican-American** relationships will grow well in the long run.\n\n\\- I am **\\`BULLISH\\`**  on Apple and Adobe. Amazing products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **CURRENT HOLDINGS (ordered by priority &amp; checkup time):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GOOG &amp; AMZN exposure through tech ETFs** ::: priority FB\n\n**NVIDIA, AMD, Intel EXPOSURE through semiconductor ETFS** ::: priority Texas Instruments\n\n**Environmental Services exposure through Sanitation ETFS** ::: priority Waste Management\n\n**Adobe and AutoDesk exposure through cloud software ETFs** :: priority Adobe\n\n**Nintendo exposure through gaming ETFS ::** priority Nintendo\n\n**Cisco exposure through cloud networking and edge computing ETFS** Cicsco, Fastly, Cloudflare, etc\n\n**TELECOM networking ETFS** :: priority TMobile\n\n**Manufacturing technology, industrial sectors, and robotics exposure to**  Fanuc, ABB, Siemens, Sherwin-Williams, VW, GM, Nissan, Toyota, Panasonic,\n\n**Healthcare services ETF** :: priority Cigna\n\n**FB -- LONG**\n\n**PAYPAL --  LONG**\n\n**TEXAS INSTRUMENTS - LONG**\n\n**MSFT     --  LONG**\n\n**APPLE   --  LONG**\n\n**ADOBE -- LONG**\n\n**DISNEY -  LONG**\n\n**BITCOIN - LONG**\n\n**TMOBILE - 2 YEARS**\n\n**VISA -- 2 YEARS**\n\n**JPM - 2 YEARS**\n\n**TWITTER - 2 YEARS**\n\n**SQUARE - 1 YEAR**\n\n**LYFT - 1 YEAR**\n\n**FASTLY - QUARTERLY**\n\n**CLOUDFLARE - QUARTERLY**\n\n**1LIFE MEDICAL - QUARTERLY**\n\n**FIVERR - QUARTERLY**\n\n**DRAFT KING - QUARTERLY YEAR + CHICAGO POLITICS**\n\n**GROUPON - SPARE CHANGE JAR**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**## EXCITED TO ACQUIRE**\n\n**- ADOBE**\n\n\\- **QQQ**\n\n\\- **SHERWIN WILLIAMS**\n\n\\- **TOYOTA**\n\n\\- **KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN**\n\n\\-",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 25th, 2020.\n\n# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April\u2019s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible, and that\u2019s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It\u2019s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.\u201d Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company\u2019s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.\n*****\n&gt; Astra Zeneca\u2019s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department\u2019s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.\n*****\n&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there\u2019s another spike in infections.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople are still scared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the personal behavior that\u2019s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We\u2019ll get back to some semblance of normal. It\u2019s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBy the end of the year, if we don\u2019t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I\u2019m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AUZd4pd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TGBcnTP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DjoySnm.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yJXH3jZ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0QEkmb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c5ZprTz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jn7Momp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ym1qBMT.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FPry3Mw.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QGY45ds.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qjKjCb6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/KiRgaMa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges\n\n&gt; # Equities\n\n&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.\n\n&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNear-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.\n\n*****\n\n# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom\n\n&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201dThe monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession\u2019s official start,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today\u2019s LEI number largely confirms April\u2019s strong moves in the equity markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.\n\n&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.\n\n*****\n\n# What Happens When The Bear Ends?\n\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.20.20-blog-chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average\n\n&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.\n\n&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking \"beat rates\" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main \"beat rate\" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.\n\n&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our \"Earnings Explorer\" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**\n\n&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.\n\n&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a \"glass half full\" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/guidance5yr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day\n\n&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n&gt; For decades the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market\u2019s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17c1f2e9847dc9535fcaf9721be1fd15/cf4b21edc88189d8-06/s640x960/e768e94e9f16dd65cdae2b4f8d23f15f1b3806f5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance\n\n&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.\n\n&gt; In election years since 1950, June\u2019s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively.

        "selftext": "How many people really understand what they\u2019re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive \u201cin the future\u201d, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what\u2019s been going on in markets, I don\u2019t like my chances but here goes:\n\nLet\u2019s start with\u2026\n\n**How does NVDA make money?**\n\nNVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer \u2013 generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them. \n\nSimply put, NVDA\u2019s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.\n\nNotably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like \u201csell at a discount to\u201d) their \u201cadd-in board\u201d (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.  \n\n**What is a GPU?**\n\nNVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don\u2019t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to \u201caccelerate\u201d the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let\u2019s not get too technical.\n\n**Who uses NVDA\u2019s GPUs?**\n\nThere are two main broad end markets for NVDA\u2019s GPUs \u2013 Gaming and Professional. Let\u2019s dig into each one:  \n\n**The Gaming Market:**\n\nA Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)\n\nGPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren\u2019t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs \u2013 guys like the equivalent of today\u2019s DELL/HP/Lenovo \u2013 , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board \u2013 the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked \u2013 and this was a real masterstroke \u2013 the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.\n\n**Some more Modern History**\n\nThis is what NVDA\u2019s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time \u2013 NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno \n\nSo what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA\u2019s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI\u2019s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA\u2019s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA\u2019s sales skyrocketed \u2013 as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC \u2013 people don\u2019t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions. \n\nAnd then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9 \n\nThis resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h \n\nYou can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend [\\[TM1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_1) hurting NVDA\u2019s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times \u2013 Fortnite \u2013 only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics \u2013 an Integrated GPU from 2012!\n\nSo at this point you might go back to NVDA\u2019s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?\n\nThe answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd \n\nFollowing this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 \u2013 a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD\u2019s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD\u2019s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.  \n\nA good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ \n\nThis leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head? \n\nThe secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves[\\[TM2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_2) , as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed. \n\nAMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT \u2013 the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.\n\nNVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing \u2013 it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant. \n\nThe last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-\u00e0-vis AMD \u2013 this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.\n\nTo make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative. \n\nIt would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.\n\n**The Professional Market:**\n\nA Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)\n\nAs it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue \u2013 truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.\n\nInitially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia. \n\n**Some More Modern History**\n\nNVDA\u2019s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don\u2019t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have \u2013 going back to 2005:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI \n\nIn the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing. \n\nAs this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:\n\n1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)\n\n2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)\n\n3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)\n\n4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)\n\n5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)\n\n6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)\n\nIn more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr\\_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2 \n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr\\_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7 \n\nIt is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let\u2019s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops \u2013 sometimes it really sucks being educated.\n\n**What is Machine Learning?**\n\nAt a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called \u201cOrdinary Least Squares\u201d OLS regression, and that type of regression has a \u201cclosed form\u201d solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.\n\nAs it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn\u2019t require a GPU!\n\nHowever, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn\u2019t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to \u201ctransform\u201d the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.\n\nSo people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it\u2026 until recently. \n\nWhat changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called \u201cDeep Learning\u201d. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!\n\nHere is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW \n\nNow we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful \u2013 primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.\n\nGiven the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using \u201cDeep Learning\u201d, \u201cMachine Learning\u201d and \u201cAI\u201d as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning. \n\n**Back to the Competitive Picture**\n\n**For the Tesla Segment**\n\nSo NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?\n\nFirstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.\n\nNot only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil &amp; gas/automotive. \n\nNVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere[\\[TM3\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_3) , announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 \u2013 the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google\u2019s TPU V3 \u2013 Google\u2019s Machine Learning specific processor. [\\[TM4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_4) Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better \u2013 if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google\u2019s spec. \n\nAnd indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe. \n\nThere is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh \n\nWith Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, [\\[TM5\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_5) IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout[\\[TM6\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_6)  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.\n\n**For the Quadro segment**\n\nThe Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA\u2019s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC \u2013 the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 \u2013 talk about shaking up a quiet segment. \n\n**Pulling things together**\n\nLet\u2019s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does \u2013 paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.\n\nWe have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia\u2019s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.\n\nIt is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA\u2019s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP \n\nThe question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can\u2019t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.\n\nTesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here \u2013 perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let\u2019s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let\u2019s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let\u2019s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income. \n\nThis company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings \u2013 earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.\n\nShockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel\u2019s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities. \n\nIf I didn\u2019t see NVDA\u2019s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I\u2019m short here!",

        "selftext": "I've paid for an options screener software that enabled me to filter any option in the universe, so I decided to share some of the results with WSB community (because I'm a nice person). I've filtered only for calls (bears can fuck off) less than 40% IV and had decent volume. I also screened for low premium options because I know you poor fucks can't afford expensive ones. \n\nI hand picked a few based on some other criteria (i.e., how much below is it from fair value, is it a nice innovative company etc.). This list doesn't include any meme stocks, because I know you all are looking for things that are not being mentioned on fucking WSB. Here are the results:  \n\n\n* CMCSA 40c 7/17 - 26.64% IV --&gt; $0.3 premium\n* TWNK 12.5c 6/19 - 28.48% IV --&gt; $0.1 premium\n* INTC 70c 7/17 - 31.03% IV --&gt; $0.26 premium\n* INTC 65c 6/19 - 31.47% IV --&gt; $0.45 premium\n* VOD 17c 6/19 - 31.69% IV --&gt; $0.07 premium\n* ALXN 120c 6/19 - 33.9% IV --&gt; $0.25 premium\n* TAK 20c 6/19 - 38.29% IV --&gt; $0.15 premium\n* FDX 140c 6/19 - 38.42% IV --&gt; $0.2 premium\n\nI threw two telcos in there: CMCSA and VOD. Both are undervalued imo. Intel is also heavily overlooked these days, and with today's dip, presents a unique opportunity. ALXN is a parma company that crushed their earnings despite working on non-covid related stuff, which is a strong statement to big investors that company is resilient. Rest of them you can do you own due diligence. \n\nLet's discuss together. Two autists are better than one, so we make semi-autist decisions!",

        "selftext": "\\## **My history investing in college and my first month investing in February:**\n\nLearned about miners and blockchain validation with a chemical engineering friend before the rally.\n\n\\- Bought **XRP** at $.15 and $.25, sold at $3.28 (I valued at $4 or $5 dollars MAX in 10 years if blockchain found adoption)\n\n\\- Bought **AMD** after the rally at $11 because it was ridiculous how much cost efficiency they had introduced to the market to poor people like me unlike **NVIDIA** products which always seemed far removed and discouraged me.\n\n\\- I started with **Panasonic** because I had missed out on the window to invest in **Tesla** at 200-300 range. I believed **Panasonic** to be similar to **AMD's** relationship to **bitcoin**; while all eyes looked at the shiny object, I looked at the boring parts that built it.\n\n\\- The market crashed, so I DCA'd aggressively and controlled my emotions through out. I was more concerned with my performance to commitment rather than my returns at the time. I did well.\n\n\\- My investments in March 19 was **SQ** and **Lyft**\n\n\\## **My Strategy now that I have income**\n\n\\- I bought up to 5,000 dollars in stocks ranging from **FANUC** (industrial robotics) to **DENNYS** (logistics/real estate)\n\n\\- I trimmed down to $2,300 but will rapidly rebuild with a different approach:\n\n\\- I'm buying 1 stock in the company before making any further developments with. Following this, I will purchase ETFs in sectors that I **want** to see develop in the next 5-15 years. I will buy 1 stake into these ETFs and combine it with my 1 stock purchase to create the necessary offset.\n\n\\- For example, I bought 1 stock of **Texas Instruments**  for $109 followed by a purchase in **SOXX ETF** for semiconductors, which has the largest ETF allocation to **Texas Instruments.** I will apply similar logic to companies like **Facebook, Paypal,** etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I do this \"1 chip\" start in multiple industries because I want to pick some arbitrary point in time but I have a lot of industries &amp; ecosystems that I would like to reasonably participate in. This will still cost a lot of money to start off with and buys me time to study company numbers and outlooks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **My current market sentiment**\n\n**-** I consider where you start on a graph as somewhat arbitrary and see the current market stability as somewhat of an exercise in game theory and rowing a boat throat a thick fog. I believe it's optimal to row cautiously forward and to not stay still. With cautious rowing, you'll be able to react appropriately if you are suddenly met by a waterfall or a path with clearer vision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`*****BEARISH\\`*** on Amazon in the long term. I believe that slowly, but surely, the market will consume Amazon's hold on its markets. I don't believe Amazon will maintain the status quo on cloud computing due to the quality of its competitors. I absolutely LOVE **Google Cloud Platform** and utilize **Firebase real-time database** very often. **Microsoft** has made some extremely important acquisitions recently in **Github and NPM - that's enormous.**\n\n\\-  I have suspicions about **Amazon** will struggle internationally. I don't know if Amazon will penetrate China the way China does, or if it will succeed in locations south of Mexico against things like **Mercado Libre**\n\n\\- I have suspicions that tech platforms will soon integrate in a meaningful way with financials. As in, the virtualization of stores and forwarded payments in places like the **Facebook(Visa) Market Place, Twitter(Square) payment sending, Paypal(honey) &amp; Amazon purchasing, Gaming credits, etc.**\n\n**-** I am \\`**bullish**\\` on Facebook. Facebook is utterly invaluable and scales globally. The reason it's adopted in **Mexico**, for example, is because it's cheaper and faster than other services. They also service millions of developers with **React** and its growing development ecosystem. They provide a standardized marketting platform for small businesses on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and soon to be JIO. I would not be surprised if they soon enter the fintech sector.\n\n\\- I am \\`**bullish\\`** on **Paypal**. They are seemingly repeating their previous success by servicing large online commerce that are upgrading their systems. **Honey/Paypal** will scrape coupons for Amazon and force organizations like Visa to compete with  **real-time financial services**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`bullish\\`** on cloud software and networking. I think **CDNs** and dedicated **services for Cybersecurity** will maintain. Sure Google provides these services but things like **Cloudflare** and **Fastly** have dedicated solutions to fast image processing, DDoS protection, and more that other platforms may not be able to **allocate their resources to**. **Cloudflare** has an enormous network, and **Fastly** provides a great system for you to enjoy content like **Reddit.** I think it's hard to miss the mark here - the highway of the internet is going to get faster and more assets will be maintained in the server's space - the ecosystem must grow with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am ***\\`EXTREMELY BEARISH***\\*\\*\\`\\*\\* on Beyond Meat. I've been vegetarian for 10 years. IT'S BAD. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING ATTENTION. VEGETARIANS ARE LYING IF THEY SAY IT'S AMAZING. ***IT'S LITERALLY DOG FOOD***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am \\`**BULLISH\\`** on the long term development of **Mexico**. I think companies like **Kansas City Southern** that services **Mexican-American** relationships will grow well in the long run.\n\n\\- I am **\\`BULLISH\\`**  on Apple and Adobe.

        "selftext": "Trading options during earnings season definitely adds to the intensity level, but makes it very interesting and rewarding. Yesterday I bought a 120 TWLO 5/22 p @5.30. I also bought a 135 TWLO c @ 6.10. Now, I have been buying calls in TWLO from 90 and up in the past month. I thought the recent run up provided for a difficult earnings season. However, I bought the call around 12:30pm because I didn\u2019t want to miss a potential pop. Got lucky. In retrospect I shouldn\u2019t have even bought the Put, but a little protection is fine if it fell hard. I sold the C this morning for a $2800 profit. The news was so good on TWLO, that I also bought an OTM, at the time, 165 C later on the day. Up another $1200 unrealized. \n\nI had 8 UBER calls. My strategy was to sell all if UBER traded above 30 in the AM which I did. After I had time to digest LYFTs report, I bought 4 ITM 28 UBER back. Still holding. \n\nROKU was another great holding of mine. However, I sold all three deep ITMs before the close because I was up over 6k from them. I did buy one OTM 145 C. Gone. \n\nI\u2019m a huge believer in SQ so I picked up 5 ITMs today. Granted, I sold all 10 ITM calls yesterday before earnings. I held 3 ITM PYPLs. I thought Square May have bad earnings based on the pre earnings trade and PYPL would be good. The markets could easily sell a stock no matter how good the earnings, INTC. AMZN, AMD for example but I held my PYPLs. \n\nAlso, during the day I kept buying and adding to my SBUX ITM C positions and bought more CRM options on the strength of TWLOs report. I\u2019m also holding several other positions. Very good day overall!! \n\nI\u2019m looking to create a good group discussion to bounce trade ideas and strategies. I welcome other successful trade stories! I\u2019m happy to help others also. As I said numerous times, I am a strong confident directional trader. Most of all, be patient, learn from your mistakes, take calculated risks and stay mentally strong. Good luck!!",

        "selftext": "Repost cause the old one got removed idk why\n\nNote: I'm sorry if this post is bad/hard to read I haven't done something like this before\n\n**What is EMAN:** EMAN (eMagin) is a company that makes OLED displays. According to their website their displays \"perform at low-power levels, extended temperature ranges and provide image performance not possible with LCD technologies \". They offer military grade products, VR products, and products that are meant for commercial use.\n\n**Indicators/Fundamentals:** Market cap of 40.87 million. The RSI is at 88.72 as of today, a sign that it will (hopefully) rise soon, but also quickly crash after that. The company's volume today is at 24 million (as of around 3:40PM Tuesday), much higher than the 835,000 average. Earnings per share is -0.09 dollars. Profit margin is -16%. The force index is really high, meaning that the price is already pumped and might crash soon, however, before this I think it will rise some more (hopefully this will happen tomorrow)\n\n **Earnings:** The earnings date is on May 14 (Thursday) at 9AM Eastern Time, there's been rumors of a partnership with Intel, probably not true. The expected EPS is -0.02. Other: There's been a post recently on some news saying that eMagin might partner with Intel or some other large company , the news is dated from early 2018. Their estimated sales growth this quarter is -7.40%, but the 2021 estimate is growth of 102.10% according to yahoo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary**: Might go up because of hype idk but it's more likely we've all been scammed, hopefully it goes up though, idk about the long run",

        "selftext": "So the Natural Gas futures market closed around its support for the front month contract today going into the weekend. This presents a unique opportunity going into May. As many may know from my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gczz67/intermediate_outlook_on_the_natural_gas_ng_market/)([s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g239f4/natural_gas_ngk20_play_for_tomorrow_416/)) about Natural Gas futures, the market for the commodity has been experiencing severe demand destruction for the last month and a half, similar to the market for crude oil (WTI). The EIA released its usual [Natural Gas Storage report](http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html) this last Thursday morning, indicating a three-digit build for the week ended measured in billion cubic feet. This was in alignment with expectations regarding the build, and it has been noted by multiple analysts that the Natural Gas market's downward finish this week was mostly due to the rerouting of gas production after an explosion at the Texas Eastern Transmission (Tetco) system (prices initially surged because traders figured gas production would be hindered; albeit not as much as they thought).\n\nSo, since the market demand is down, what are the producers going to do about it that hasn't been baked into the trading entirely? Mass production shut-ins are anticipated by many analysts which could see a price for Natural Gas higher than $2.10/mmbtu by the end of the month, according to [Natural Gas Intel](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121931-natural-gas-forward-prices-find-footing-despite-continued-volatility-uncertainty) (NGI). Various analytics groups including EBW have pointed to \"steep declines\" in Natural Gas output for the coming weeks as producers continue to cut back to combat the demand destruction. These declines have been in alignment with various models thus far. In addition, 'net short' positions for Natural Gas futures became 'net long' recently, according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-natural-gas-prices-are-a-hot-bet-11588339279) mentioning that speculative bets that were \"very bearish\" in the last month or so, have been completely unwound now.\n\nBroader market implications in the energy industry could have bearing on the price of Natural Gas in the next couple months as well, according to [NGI](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121934-global-oil-supply-cuts-now-seen-reaching-17-million-bd-in-2q). Analysts are predicting the largest liquid oil shut-in in the energy industry's history during Q2, mostly driven by OPEC, Russia, and North America. A broad reduction in crude oil production will severely limit Natural Gas production, as much of it is a byproduct of WTI. As the energy producers continue to react to the COVID-19 environment and reduced demand, energy prices should continue to see overall growth in the next month despite the volatility of the markets. This has already been evidenced by the front month crude oil (CL) and Natural Gas (NG) contracts rising significantly since crude oil was negative momentarily last month. \n\n*Position Disclaimer: Currently long* [two NYMEX Natural Gas June contracts](https://imgur.com/a/NkMLmlc) *(NGM20) going into Sunday.*\n\nTL;DR $UNG Calls or Put Credit Spread (or naked Puts for those risk loving autists) for the options players.

        "selftext": "Intel is to release GPU this year. They are to officially enter the discrete GPU business. This will compress margins on amd and nvda. \n\nAmd is getting competitve against intel in CPU, esepcially with Zen 3 coming out. So intel's getting killed there as well. But in return AMD's gpu business, which despite the quality being much weaker than nvidia, still comprise 50% of the revenue, is about to be challenged by intel.\n\nAll 3 are threatend by cloud gaming as well, and perhaps cloud computing in the future. Cloud gaming will reduce PC/latop upgrade cycle even further. A 10 year old PC can run games flawlessly on Stadia and Geforce Now. Many people who otherwise would upgrade their PC now just purcahse cloud gaming subscription. cloud gaming seem to be growing extremely fast. \n\nNvidia do have the foresight so they set up GFN on their own. But it cannabilises its own GPU business. Better than let a competitor do it to Nvidia, but still not ideal. \n\nand then ARM is to threaten both intel and amd cpus. it soon will be good enough for general computing and it has lower power and cheaper to make. And combined with the trend of cloud computing it's esepcially deadly. With cloud gaming, you can easily play AAA games with demanding graphics settings in a browser, with a PC or mobile device powered only by ARM CPUs.  \n\nI just dont see good growth oppotunity for these 3 stocks in the near future. both amd and nvda have fat growth premium, how long will that last? intc is also going nowhere due to cpu market getting challenged.",

        "selftext": " My [Earnings Call Keynotes](https://imgur.com/VAYvBW4) for the week of May 4th to May 8th 2020. \n\nThis week I will be focusing my attention to 3 of my major holding earnings calls. The earnings calls include: \n\n1. The Walt Disney Company ($DIS) - Tuesday May 5th, 4:30 PM EDT\n2. FLIR Systems, Inc ($FLIR) - Wednesday May 6th, 9:00 AM EDT\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation ($HEAR) - Thursday May 7th, 5:00PM EDT\n\nThe summaries below, are the reasons why I am bullish on these companies for the medium to long-term. \n\n**FLIR Systems ($FLIR):**\n\nThe first company I was to discuss is FLIR. FLIR System has been developing thermal imaging systems since 1978 for use in the avionics industry, because using thermal imaging we can see through total darkness, as well as clouds, fog, etc. Now that we know why they were formed let's look at the current markets for FLIRs technology.\n\n1. US Defense: FLIR currently has many contracts with the US Military and has worked with them for many years. FLIR provides thermal scanning solutions which are used for Border Security, Marine Patrol &amp; Coastal, Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, as well as detection of explosives or other harmful substances. Working with the US military provides a revenue stream which continues to drive innovation and continuous improvement on their already market leading tech. I have also attached a link in the video description which shows all the recent FLIR contracts. \n\n[http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items\\_per\\_page=10&amp;page=0](http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items_per_page=10&amp;page=0)\n\n1. Autonomous Driving: FLIR has contracts with Vioneer which supports companies such as General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, Peugeot, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz in their autonomous driving development. This will provide an opportunity for long term growth around the globe. Their thermal sensors are mainly used for Emergency braking systems which is advantageous over many other types of imaging systems for driving in foggy, or reduced visibility conditions. \n2. Health and Safety: As the current COVID-19 pandemic continues more companies announce the importance of thermal scanning being integrated into protection of the public and their workers. As we know with COVID-19, a common symptom of most viral infections is a fever. Thermal imaging can directly detect viral infections but it is an amazing screen tool which can immediately identify those that are high-risk to others. Airports, hospitals, and public markets are already beginning to adopt this technology, however, the growth is endless. This current pandemic has shown us the need for thermal screening and I believe a system like this will be adopted around the globe over the next couple of years. Amazon, Tyson Foods, Intel,  and Ford are just some of the companies which have already begun to implement thermal screening tech in their facilities. \n\nNow I want to take a minute to discuss the company valuation. Before the COVID-19 Pandemic hit FLIR peaked at a market cap of almost 8B, since the all time high its price per share has dropped nearly 40% to just 42.84 at the time of this analysis. It currently has a forward P/E of 18.31 which is slightly above average but a PEG ratio of 0.97 which is awesome especially as I expect the short-term and long-term growth estimates to accelerate. They currently have a revenue approaching 2B annually with a healthy operating margin of approximately 20%. In terms of the balance sheet, they currently have 1.1B in current assets with only 413MM in current liabilities giving them a Current Ratio over 2.5. This company has an average CAGR of 20% per year over the last 20 years not including the dividend it has paid out for the last 10, and I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon. \n\n**Turtle Beach Corp ($HEAR):**\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the reason why Turtle Beach first came onto my radar. After reading *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz which focuses on the field of data science, I became intrigued of how I could use it in my investing strategies. Now, of course I know data is important in investing, massive companies will use satellite images looking on Tesla factory parking lots to count the inventory levels, but the difference now was that I had access to real time unbiased data using google trends. During the start of lock-down I started to observe trends happening in the real world and used my online resource to see if I could confirm my hypothesis.\n\nI noticed in my friend group and online that there was a sudden interest in gaming due to an increased amount of people being quarantined at home. Now, I knew gaming companies were an obvious beneficiary during the pandemic but what game was everyone playing? Call of Duty Warzone was released on March 10th, 2020 which was almost perfect timing having over 30 million players in under 2 weeks. Call of Duty Warzone was created by Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) but it was a free game, and ATVI was already a $40 billion company so how much could that actually impact the share price in the long-term. Now in first person battle royale games such as Warzone, directional sound is very important to having success in the game. So obviously we can target gaming headset companies. What are the most popular headsets? Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach are just a couple of the brands of headsets out there but realistically the best way to get direct exposure to such a niche market is through Turtle Beach. Now this was all a hypothesis, let's look at what the data shows.(PS: this is the trend from today, although I originally purchased on March 30th when I was doing these activities)\n\n[Figure 1: Google Trends Relative Search Volume (5 years); xbox headset (blue), gaming headset (red), turtle beach headset (red)](https://imgur.com/a/sWzsUIb) \n\nWe can obviously see this data is quite cyclical with a double peak which occurs the last week of November and the third/fourth week of December every calendar year for obvious reasons. Now we can obviously see there has been a substantial demand in late March and throughout all of April in 2020, peaking higher than the holiday quarter for the first time as far back as the data is available (2004). Can we compare this increased demand to anything else we have seen? If you look closely you can see the slight uptick in demand in Jan/Feb 2018, that was when fortnite went mainstream and peaked in the gaming world. Fortnite is a battle royale game, similar to Warzone in its play-style. How did Turtle Beach ($HEAR) perform during that time? \n\n[Figure 2: Turtle Beach Share Price Q1 and Q2 2018](https://imgur.com/JqxYEwI) \n\nAfter a surprise revenue and eps beat in Q1 of 2018 the share price of Turtle Beach went to a share price of over $30 from a recent low of under $2. Now it is important to notice that the company struggled to maintain this value for the shareholders over time, but the balance sheet was in a much worse position at that time. \n\nSince 2018 the Turtle Beach management team has significantly improved their balance sheet including reducing the debt/equity ratio. They have created strategic partnerships and acquisitions allowing them to gain market share in fast growing areas. As well, they have been able to diversify into PC Gaming instead of purely console. \n\nThe current global demand is great for Turtle Beach in the short to medium-term, as well, the new Xbox and PlayStation is scheduled to be released in Q4 of 2020. With my confidence increasing in the management team I believe this company has a ton of upside potential in the next 3-6 months, possibly longer. This is not a play you can just invest in and leave for 20 years though, you must monitor the environment for the gaming industry, pay close attention to the status of the brand among the community, and keep a close eye on the execution of the management team. \n\n**Disney ($DIS):**\n\n\\*Sorry, it's getting late and I do not have time to write my full analysis for Disney however my keynotes are basically what I want to pay attention to on the conference call. Disney has a history of making great investments, and brand loyalty. Of course the parks are a massive liability given the status of the pandemic however I believe people will come back shortly after the pandemic has subsided. Disney+ service is experiencing growth like no other streaming service has seen before, and most of the content is recycled. They currently offer an extremely low price but have plenty of room to adjust this moving forward. \n\n**Disclosure:** Anyways, I am very bullish on FLIR and Disney in the long-term and have recently added to my positions. I have recently purchased Turtle Beach, and am holding for up-to 6 months but will continue to monitor the business environment. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial planner, nor financial analyst. Do your own due diligence before purchasing any equities, the discussion above is purely my opinion. \n\nThanks for reading. I just put this together quickly as I wanted it out well before the Disney Earnings call. I hope this was helpful in some way, please feel free to provide any feedback. Good luck to all, stay safe!",

        "selftext": " MPWR stock is too good. MPWR was 10% over all time high, even after yesterday's dip. Their stock price is an anomaly in their sector: $SOXX is up 30% from the march drop, still below february highs. MPRWs larger competitors like Analog devices($ADI), Texas Instruments($TXN), ON semiconductor(ON), and Intel show similar gains. This makes sense: these companies make fundamental manufacturing parts and are sensitive to weak global manufacturing and trade. So what makes MPWR so special? What do they do?\n\n90+% of MPWR's business is the design and sale of DC power supply/power converter chips, the rest is similar derived devices like motor drivers and power sensors. They do not actually manufacture chips themselves, instead contracting to semiconductor foundries. The vast majority of their customers are manufacturers of integrated circuits, mostly in china. This risk profile is common in the segment, but it does leave them exposed to China specific market forces like tariffs, quarantines.\n\nTheir product is so universal to electronic devices that they have a very broad customer base in consumer electronics, industrial automation,  automotive, computing and telecom infrastructure. This has insulated them from some of the cyclic boom-bust patterns of the sector, and historically MPWR's performance is consistently better than the semiconductor ETFs $SOXX.\n\nMPWRs recent history shows some decent management moves. 2018 was a banner year for MPWR. They posted 61% year over year profit growth and their stock price mostly traded sideways for the year. They invested heavily until q4 2019 tanked the sector. They were smart enough to see the contraction coming and were able to eke out 1% profit growth through investment returns and executive pay structure deferments. A better than expected Q1 earnings report helped kick them up over 200$.\n\nSo there's stuff to like. Seems like a good buy in the 150-160 range.nce it comes down, and I think it will come down, here's why:\n\nThe most basic indicators are wrong: P/E ratio is 83. This is 4x higher than typical for the sector, 2x higher than is normal for their closest competitors during the best times. Market analysts are not recommending this stock, it's not being pumped on twitter. MPWR stock looked pretty normal until the second week of april until april 9:\n\nAround April 9-10 MPWR begins to diverge from competitor $POSI after a press release announcing they built a ventilator gets picked up by a few news aggregators. I encourage you to go look at this ventilator:\n\nhttps://www.monolithicpower.com/en/mps-open-source-ventilator\n\nThis is not a remotely viable product. It doesn't even offer practical improvements on the open source ventilator it's based on. It's a medium quality arduino project put together using spare parts, lithium batteries, and MPWR off-the shelf hardware. To me this suggests MPWR has engineers and marketing staff short for paying work.\n\nYou have likely noticed ads/speculation/spam about making money from 5G networks and internet infrastructure. After the ventilator story brought attention to MPWR I expect unfamiliar traders began investigating and found MPWR's marketing materials about these products. MPWR makes almost all of its money from 5 markets:\n\n1) Computer/server gear at roughly 30% of their business\n\n2) Consumer Electronics at 25% of their business\n\n3) Industrial/Commercial Devices 15%\n\n4) Embedded Automotive Devices 15%\n\n5) Infrastructure to consumer scale Telecommunications gear, 15%\n\nNone of their markets are in great shape.\n\nComputer and semiconductor markets are projected to shrink this year, even with some cloud growth.  Unemployment is hurting consumer spending and with that Auto/Consumer electronics spending will shrink.  Telecommunications infrastructure spending could grow this year but broad 5g rollout is scheduled at least a year out. Industrial products might have opportunities with new customers who don't already know who they are, but a locked down sales force and the lack of variety in their product development are bad signs: their sales teams will be less effective globally and I don't expect viable new products from their engineering team.\n\nWithout good new revenue lines they'll need to cut costs. Signs point to them being fucked here. They bought a new US facility shortly before the crash/shelter in place. They purchase their silicon wafers in yearly installments based on sales projections, so inventory costs are locked in. They have an abysmal 1.94 inventory turnover ratio. Maybe this is secretly good: sucking that bad suggests ample room for supply chain improvements.\n\nFinally, their  Q1 earnings which kicked the stock to record highs might not be a good indicator of their health during that quarter. Earnings transcripts describe their sales are long cycle collaborations with oems, with orders taking 8-16 weeks to fulfill. With lead times that long new bookings could have dropped 90% during the end of Q1 and the signal wouldn't show up until next quarter.\n\nAlso: an aside: breathing equipment is a saturated and losing game. Thousands of people are working on solutions, but they won't beat the existing ventilator manufacturers. They are competing with tested, regulatory approved products manufactured with purpose built tooling and process. These companies have already multiplied their throughput with quick purchases of tooling and wiped out the supply of valves, instrumentation and raw materials needed to make that gear. The flattening of infection curves points to less gear being needed than was thought. Look for profits in suppliers of these raw parts.($PH)",

Although CNBC\u2019s reporting on the matter yesterday appeared to imply that the deal was far from certain, a fresh development today seems to indicate that the negotiations may have graduated to an advanced stage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber has now proposed the offering of senior notes, bearing a principal amount of $750 million and maturing in 2025. According to the company\u2019s press release, the notes will be offered to qualified institutional investors. In a crucial caveat, the press release states:\n&gt; \n&gt; Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) Receive a Share Price Boost on the Back of New Acquisitions\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cUber intends to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Given that Uber has chosen to explicitly mention \u201cpotential acquisitions\u201d as an impetus for this fresh funding, it seems that the buyout negotiations with Grubhub may now have advanced to the \u2018home stretch\u2019 phase.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a refresher, CNBC reported yesterday that Uber and Grubhub have held buyout negotiations recently and that the latest all-stock proposal offered 2.15 shares in Uber for every Grubhub share. However, according to CNBC\u2019s sources, Grubhub has rejected this proposal. Bear in mind that the two companies have held intermittent talks on this matter for about a year now. Nonetheless, today\u2019s development seems to imply that a potential deal may be close at hand.",

        "selftext": "I have been looking to sell some covered calls from my rather staid dividend producing portfolio and reap some of the currently high premiums. I see that the VIX is currently at about 30, lower than the past couple of months, but still high in historic terms. And yet I see that the stocks in my portfolio all show an implied volatility that is much higher. Stocks like ABT, ABBV, MCD, CAT, PEP, WFC, PRU, INTC and many others have IVs that are significantly higher. \n\nI thought that VIX was close to the average IV of the SPX, and I would think that some of my stocks would be higher, others lower. But out of 25 stocks, only one (UN) has an IV lower than 30. \n\nIs there any thing for me to read in this deviation of IV in my portfolio?",
