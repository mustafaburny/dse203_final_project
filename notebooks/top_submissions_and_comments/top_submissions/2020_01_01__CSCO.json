        "selftext": "This time last year, Slack Technologies, the popular workplace chat provider, was one of the most eagerly anticipated public tech debuts of 2019. That seems like a long time ago. Since Slack went public in June, its stock has dropped about 40%.\n\n\nThe reason for the slump: Revenue growth at Slack is slowing and competition is intensifying, especially from Microsoft. The tech giant is relying on a familiar tactic\u2014bundling a Slack killer with a widely used existing product, its Office 365 suite of apps. Given that competitive pressure, I predict 2020 will be the year that\u2014after years of acquisition speculation\u2014a larger tech company will finally buy Slack.\n\n\nPotential suitors could include Amazon\u2014which has reportedly eyed Slack in the past\u2014and Google. Both companies are top providers of cloud computing services and could plug Slack into their cloud units to increase the revenue they generate from online applications. \n\n\nAlready a big Amazon cloud customer, Slack has committed to spending a minimum of $250 million with the Amazon Web Services division between 2018 and 2023, according to regulatory filings. Becoming part of Amazon could help Slack\u2014which is currently unprofitable\u2014trim some costs.    \n\n\nCisco Systems and Salesforce, both of which could use a spark to fire up their collaboration software businesses, might also make sense as acquirers. Both companies have relationships with corporate chief information officers that could open the door to customers in the Fortune 500. \n\n\nA Slack purchase would be a sizable deal. Slack has a market capitalization of just over $12 billion, although its management would likely push for a higher price. One benchmark they might point to: A few weeks before it went public, Slack was valued in private market trades at about $19 billion. At that price, Slack would be the largest acquisition ever for the likes of Amazon, Google, Cisco, and Salesforce.  \n\n\nOne company that likely won\u2019t buy Slack is the company that would arguably be most responsible for its sale: Microsoft. Owning Slack, along with its in-house Slack competitor, Teams, would give Microsoft a dominant position in workplace collaboration software. Microsoft reportedly considered offering an $8 billion bid for Slack in 2016 before deciding to funnel more investment into building out Teams. \n\n\nBut I\u2019m skeptical that Microsoft could pull off such a deal. Gaining regulatory approval would be an ordeal, if not impossible, because Microsoft already offers a directly competitive product. Microsoft went through the antitrust wringer two decades ago and is happy to avoid joining other big tech companies in the regulatory spotlight now. \n\n\nSpokespeople from AWS and Salesforce declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesperson didn\u2019t have a comment. Spokespeople from Cisco and Google didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \n\n\nIf Slack CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield doesn\u2019t want to sell, he will have to find a way to win back investor confidence. Clearly what is worrying Wall Street is Slack\u2019s slowing revenue growth and increasing losses. \n\n\nThe company\u2019s annual sales grew 110% in fiscal 2018, which ended last Jan. 31, from the prior year. In fiscal 2019, that figure fell to 82%. In its most recent earnings report, Slack forecast that revenue growth for fiscal 2020 will fall even further to around 55%. Meanwhile, its net loss rose to about $88 million in the third quarter, from nearly $48 million a year earlier.\n\n\nSlack has spread like wildfire as a business tool largely through a free version of its product. To continue to grow, it must find ways to convince these users to become paying ones. During its recent earnings call, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, the company said it had 105,000 paying customers, up 30% from the same period a year earlier. \n\n\nIn an interview, Daniel Newman, founder and principal analyst at Futurum Research, said Slack\u2019s early growth was partly due to developers\u2019 frustration with the limitations of older products like Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Cisco\u2019s Webex. Now, with Microsoft pouring money into Teams and making improvements to the product to entice large companies, Slack has to work much harder to attract customers, he said. And a host of younger companies, such as Zoom and Asana, and open source startups, including Mattermost and Rocket.Chat, also offer workplace collaboration tools. \n\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of competition in the collaboration space right now,\u201d Newman said. \n\n\nThe growing competition highlights another issue for Slack. Having captured a loyal following of developers and technical users through word of mouth, it is now spending heavily on sales and marketing to show how its software can help companies be more productive. During the third quarter, its sales and marketing expenses jumped 42% to over $96 million. \n\n\nMicrosoft appears to have gotten into Butterfield\u2019s head. This first became apparent in 2016 when Slack took out a full-page ad in The New York Times to \u201cwelcome\u201d Microsoft to the market around the time it introduced Teams. More recently, Butterfield has sounded a defensive note on earnings calls, pointing out that Slack has to earn every customer and can\u2019t rely on bundling its product with other business applications, as Microsoft does. \n\n\nHe often pushes back on Microsoft\u2019s framing of its daily active user numbers for Teams, claiming that the company muddies the waters by counting people who make voice calls using Skype. Slack\u2019s usage figures more accurately reflect the deep level of engagement its users have with the service, according to Butterfield. \u201cThe confusion is deliberately created,\u201d Butterfield said on Slack\u2019s recent fiscal third quarter earnings call with investors. \n\n\nWhatever the reason, Butterfield faces a choice: Keep fighting or surrender by selling.",

International oil prices initially surged 4%. But like stocks, crude steadied as the Iranian attacks were less than feared. (CNBC)\n* The direction of the Dow, which closed lower Tuesday on concerns about rising U.S.-Iranian tensions before the airstrikes, could be swayed by the ADP\u2019s December report on private sector employment this morning. The government issues its monthly employment report on Friday. (CNBC)\n* Weekly mortgage applications fell in final weeks of 2019, but homebuyers were out shopping (CNBC)\n* Constellation Brands (STZ), Lennar (LEN), and Dow stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) are out with quarterly earnings this morning. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) and Helen of Troy (HELE) are among the companies releasing numbers after today\u2019s closing bell. (CNBC)\n* There are no reports of any U.S. service members being hurt after Iran last night launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against multiple bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. President Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cAll is well!\u201d He plans to make a statement this morning. (CNBC)\n* Iran supreme leader says missile attack was a \u2018slap on the face\u2019 for US but it \u2018wasn\u2019t enough\u2019 (CNBC)\n* World leaders call for calm after Iranian attack on US forces (CNBC)\n* Saudi Aramco shares hit lowest point since market debut as US-Iran hostilities escalate (CNBC)\n* Airlines avoid Iranian airspace, cancel flights as Mideast tensions spike (CNBC)\n* A Boeing (BA) 737-800 passenger jet, not the grounded Max, operated by a Ukrainian airline crashed minutes after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday morning. There were no survivors. Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 had 167 passengers and nine crew members on board. (CNBC)\n* United Airlines (UAL) will take a $90 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings, due to Hong Kong disruptions from ongoing anti-government protests. United said the protests have reduced demand for travel to Hong Kong. (Reuters)\n* Fugitive ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn\u2019s lawyers attacked the auto maker this morning, before he was scheduled to hold a highly-anticipated news conference, accusing Nissan of using a \u201cflawed, biased\u201d internal probe to engineer his arrest. (Reuters)\n* Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Senate Republicans are prepared to move forward on a Trump impeachment trial without agreeing first to rules about witnesses and without any Democratic votes. (CNBC)\n* Facebook (FB) and eBay (EBAY) have removed hundreds of groups and accounts engaged in trading fake reviews, after the U.K. antitrust regulator flagged concerns over them in June. (CNBC)\n* Apple\u2019s (AAPL) App Store platform grossed around $50 billion in 2019, according to analysis by CNBC. But growth is slowing. However, at $50 billion in annual sales App Store alone would be No. 64 on the Fortune 500, ahead of Cisco and behind Morgan Stanley.\n* Baked goods, candies or other cannabis-infused edibles may not be as safe as people think, especially for first-time users, children and the elderly, according to a new paper in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

You'll the notice the operating cash flow ratio is a little low, but looking deeper, a chunk of the current liabilities are in the form of deferred revenue (customer prepayments). Their TIE ratio of 5+ clearly indicates they can handle their debt payments. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe other thing I'm happy to see is the plentiful number of open positions on their careers page - a strong indicator of growth.

Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, January 8th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/08/sp-futures-go-positive-after-sinking-overnight-on-iran-retaliation.html)\n\n* S&amp;P 500 futures turned higher this morning, coming back from overnight lows of more than 1.6% after Iran retaliated for the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general. International oil prices initially surged 4%. But like stocks, crude steadied as the Iranian attacks were less than feared. (CNBC)\n* The direction of the Dow, which closed lower Tuesday on concerns about rising U.S.-Iranian tensions before the airstrikes, could be swayed by the ADP\u2019s December report on private sector employment this morning. The government issues its monthly employment report on Friday. (CNBC)\n* Weekly mortgage applications fell in final weeks of 2019, but homebuyers were out shopping (CNBC)\n* Constellation Brands (STZ), Lennar (LEN), and Dow stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) are out with quarterly earnings this morning. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) and Helen of Troy (HELE) are among the companies releasing numbers after today\u2019s closing bell. (CNBC)\n* There are no reports of any U.S. service members being hurt after Iran last night launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against multiple bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. President Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cAll is well!\u201d He plans to make a statement this morning. (CNBC)\n* Iran supreme leader says missile attack was a \u2018slap on the face\u2019 for US but it \u2018wasn\u2019t enough\u2019 (CNBC)\n* World leaders call for calm after Iranian attack on US forces (CNBC)\n* Saudi Aramco shares hit lowest point since market debut as US-Iran hostilities escalate (CNBC)\n* Airlines avoid Iranian airspace, cancel flights as Mideast tensions spike (CNBC)\n* A Boeing (BA) 737-800 passenger jet, not the grounded Max, operated by a Ukrainian airline crashed minutes after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday morning. There were no survivors. Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 had 167 passengers and nine crew members on board. (CNBC)\n* United Airlines (UAL) will take a $90 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings, due to Hong Kong disruptions from ongoing anti-government protests. United said the protests have reduced demand for travel to Hong Kong. (Reuters)\n* Fugitive ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn\u2019s lawyers attacked the auto maker this morning, before he was scheduled to hold a highly-anticipated news conference, accusing Nissan of using a \u201cflawed, biased\u201d internal probe to engineer his arrest. (Reuters)\n* Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Senate Republicans are prepared to move forward on a Trump impeachment trial without agreeing first to rules about witnesses and without any Democratic votes. (CNBC)\n* Facebook (FB) and eBay (EBAY) have removed hundreds of groups and accounts engaged in trading fake reviews, after the U.K. antitrust regulator flagged concerns over them in June. (CNBC)\n* Apple\u2019s (AAPL) App Store platform grossed around $50 billion in 2019, according to analysis by CNBC. But growth is slowing. However, at $50 billion in annual sales App Store alone would be No. 64 on the Fortune 500, ahead of Cisco and behind Morgan Stanley.\n* Baked goods, candies or other cannabis-infused edibles may not be as safe as people think, especially for first-time users, children and the elderly, according to a new paper in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. (CNBC)\n* US cancer death rate drops by largest amount on record (WSJ)\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/6Zvqsi4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dCHx1B3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/L2U900x.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YyRYK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S POST-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nT.B.A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](hhttps://i.imgur.com/C3febMV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/oJYMPr1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EiKy2Z9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/K31IbK6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sbFxcJE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/mGRBaWa.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/ugyQnBz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #6!](https://i.imgur.com/5yrcnqq.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/nrrsdZS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/2QvtmK0.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BYND\n* TSLA\n* PIXY\n* M\n* SPY\n* BA\n* TVIX\n* STZ\n* WBA\n* UVXY\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/08/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-lennar-walgreens-macys-boeing-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Constellation Brands** \u2013 The beer and spirits producer reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.21 per share, beating the $2.04 a share consensus estimate.

        "selftext": "Cybersecurity ETF HACK just hit a 52-week high \u2014 up roughly 24.8% from its 52-week low of $34.52/share.\n\nThe underlying Prime Cyber Defense Index utilizes a rules-based investment methodology to select a diverse group of companies actively involved in the cyber security industry. This includes companies like Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Okta and more.\n\nWhy the Move?\n\nThe cybersecurity corner of the U.S. stock market has been an area to watch lately, given the rise in Middle East tensions. The U.S. drone strike near the Baghdad international airport last week killed the top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and fueled bets of Iranian cyber attacks on the United States. \u201cCompanies that offer threat-detection services are the ones most likely to benefit from increased risk of attacks,\u201d per Bloomberg.\n\n(Note: I currently have a position in HACK)",

        "selftext": "Juniper Networks hit my radar last week and I opened a small position. [Looking](https://stockarmor.com/jnpr.pdf) at the numbers, this is a solid find. Nice, thick operation margin. Current assets are plump and cover liabilities 2x over.  You'll the notice the operating cash flow ratio is a little low, but looking deeper, a chunk of the current liabilities are in the form of deferred revenue (customer prepayments). Their TIE ratio of 5+ clearly indicates they can handle their debt payments. \n\nThe other thing I'm happy to see is the plentiful number of open positions on their careers page - a strong indicator of growth. The rollout of 5G may even provide additional tailwinds.\n\nIf you wanted an alternative to a large mega tech like Cisco in your portfolio. This is it.",
