        "selftext": "I need to get this out the way before I make my plea.\n\nthe current mantra of specualtors is - What should I invest in if interes rates are at zero?\n\naggresviely pay off any debt you may have, your return from this will certainlty be better off than what you will get from public markts, invest in your own education or your family members. Use the money to advance aspects of your career.\n\nhere goes\n\nI am totally aghast at peoples holdings, the chances of you making a long term gain on companies like snowflake or tesla are zero. These are not casino stocks because there are few in a casino who might make money in the long run. Paying $600,000 dollars per telsa ever sold is insane. Paying 100 times sales for snowflake is suicide. The only way you would make money is if you held the onver 40 years and had happened to pick the next walmart or apple. american equity indexes will be flat over 10 years. growth stock will be lower than flat.\n\nBut somethign like ARK innovation which has bundled the most speculative companies will become the poster child for this climate. Almost all of the return of these etfs is just multiple expansion, thats it.\n\nPeople pointing to these recent stock success of these companies  is like using a plane as an example of why gravity does not exist.\n\nPalantir for example is trading at similair PS multiples like Akamai in 2000 the stock is still 68% down. 99% of the stocks you know im talking about will do incredibly poorly.\n\nthere will be an amazon style winner in their somewhere. \n\nyou wont hold it for the length of time youll need to to make a return.\n\nMy guess is the extreme specualtion will carry on for a while yet, low interest rates and psychology will push this higher for now.\n\nIf you are holding these stocks you are the patsy and the poker game.\n\nyou may make extrmely large retunrs over the next few years.\n\nI emplore anyone with singficant amounts of their net worth in such speculative stocks or products to reconsider.\n\nsome part of us who do this for a living are looking forward to the inevitable reconing. dont give us the satisfaction.\n\nIf you do want to hold this stuff, jsut make it a small part of your portfolio.\n\nthe people selling you this stuff and charging a management fee are making an absolute killing on your total naviety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDont say you werent warned.\n\nsorry for the spelling, im watching the simpsons!",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range.

The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$MTSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$DL** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$APDN** \n&gt; * **$CAMP** \n&gt; * **$SCHL** \n&gt; * **$QTT** \n&gt; * **$SCSC** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$RFIL** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$NAV**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls.

The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 11th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOBjxtu9Ago))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.13.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHqwuwWaaI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$MTSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$DL** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$APDN** \n&gt; * **$CAMP** \n&gt; * **$SCHL** \n&gt; * **$QTT** \n&gt; * **$SCSC** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$RFIL** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$NAV**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.
