        "selftext": "Shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) fell 0.96% Tuesday after the tech giant unveiled the iPhone 13 and several other products during its annual September event in California.\n\nTech: Apple also introduced its newest iPad and Apple Watch at the event, as well as software updates. The announcements were not unexpected.\n\nDownfall: It wasn\u2019t just Apple stock that suffered yesterday from the lackluster iPhone announcement. Shares of wireless telecommunication stocks AT&amp;T (NYSE: T), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), and T-Mobile (Nasdaq: TMUS) all slipped Tuesday. Even iPhone suppliers such as Skyworks (Nasdaq: SWKS), Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) and Corning (NYSE: GLW) saw their stock prices decrease as well.\n\nBigger Picture: While the iPhone 13 has some impressive features, there were very few surprises that investors could get excited about.\n\nFinal Thoughts: It will be interesting to see if there\u2019s an increase or decrease in iPhone sales for the holiday season this year.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.

Single stocks only.\n\nMine are:\n\nMSFT- My favorite tech stock by far. In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Bannon, management is on point\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds. And only about 25% of my portfolio is in blue chips. But thought it'd be fun to see what people choose and they're reasoning.",

        "selftext": "Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. \n\nMy question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: \n\n$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. \n\n$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. \n\nSemiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. \n\nWhat are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",

They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates!

Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredits for this DD, and a shoutout, goes to [u/ddroukas](https://www.reddit.com/user/ddroukas/). I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;begin\\_plagiarism&gt;*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yj8bmpuzyp71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a6f9f941f2dbfc78063d5256fccdab29a04b84\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izejluexzyp71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba9252ec9a4efe2cb550b385fa9c38099419f025\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhio20z00zp71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd5baa49a33a130763584fdb952fc85abc95bf32\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usm8geczzyp71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fffdc7aaae1f913ab3a9400a1133ad1212c0644\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8imlj130zp71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=210716737bce8e989efa725e986cdb45e242ac1c\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blka49d40zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f1fb4ca97e2736af6a8c83c96c984716f1c3e2\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7ubjif50zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d87075d7ed1e05626f32fdcb85bd59550a1c4e\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A *(see below)*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Wait, Wait, before you downvote me into the depths of hells, let me explain. First, I have been contemplating buying puts on NVDA for about a month now, and it's kept on going up and the only reason I haven't pulled the trigger yet is because I feel like I'm missing something so let me explain my case, then you explain why I'm wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, first, NVDA is a 550 billion dollar company with 20 billion in revenue and a P/E of nearly 80, and a forward P/E of 60. This is literally SENILE, in 2000, when Intel was all the shit, as a 300 billion dollar company it had a P/E of 40, and now 20 years later it's still down while it's doubles it's revenue and 4x it's profit. So, with NVDA trading at a multiple of 80, even if let's say they 3x their eps in the next 5 years which is an extremely absurd assumption as they've already had a ton of growth fueled from cover, they would have 9 dollars of EPS and looking at today's stock price, if it stayed the same they would still be trading at a multiple of 24 which is ridiculous if they somehow just 4x their revenue in a matter of 5 years. Looking at all the growth catalysts I would find it only somewhat reasonable if they 2x their profit which would give them 6 dollars of EPS and keep them at a P/E of 40. That is once again Intels multiple at the peak of 2000 when it was also half the market cap. \n\nLastly, NVDA has gone up nearly 100% from it's lows in February for two reasons, slightly better than expected earnings and a stock split, none of which would justify that movement. \n\nSo, that's what I'm thinking, I HAVE TO BE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT?, why does this seem so overvalued as such a large company, can someone please explain because if not those 2024 140 strike price puts are looking real sexy.",

        "selftext": "I gotta tell you, this sector is pretty freaking exciting.   As a private pilot, the thought of eventually flying one of these planes is incredibly cool.   As much as Tesla has done to push EVs forward, what's happening in aviation is more meaningful.    The general aviation industry is comprised of planes that are often 50 years old.  Sure, many have been updated avionics from Garmin, but most planes lack any real development.  Yeah, Cirrus has done amazing work but for the most part, the technology hasn't changed.  Part of it has been lack of investment but that's changing now.  I think new companies like Lilium and Joby have seen what's being done in the auto industry and are saying \"we can do that.\"   Established companies like Airbus are probably saying \"we'd better get our shit together.\"   \n\nThere is no doubt that companies will fail.   I have no clue where the industry will be in 10yrs.   But, if you're psyched about what's happening in the EV space, it probably makes sense to take a look here.   Below is an article that does a great job summarizing this industry.   It's not written by a pump and dump shit publication but rather the association that helps promote and govern aviation.\n\nGood luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/september/pilot/evtols-score-big-bucks](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/september/pilot/evtols-score-big-bucks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: From the article.\n\n\"Joby Aviation has attracted a large share of venture capital over the past year. Uber Elevate, the ride-sharing giant\u2019s air taxi concept, decided to walk away from that idea and throw support amounting to $75 million to Joby\u2019s S4, a 170-knot, 150-nautical-mile, five-seat eVTOL. Toyota, Intel, and JetBlue anted up another $820 million. Joby\u2019s Santa Cruz, California, factory has reportedly been expanded, and the company said it expects to hire 1,600 employees. Joby has raised some $1.5 billion. Reports indicate that the FAA has approved a certification pathway for the S4. Joby also says that pilot certification, airframe, and airspace regulations are in the works with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Certification and entry into service are expected in 2023.\"\n\n\"Two German designs have also apparently been making great headway. Lilium, maker of what it calls five- and seven-seat eVTOL \u201cjets,\u201d says that certification for both designs is in progress with the FAA and EASA. These are powered by 36 electrically driven, tiltable ducted fans set in the canard and wing trailing edges. Cruise speed is advertised as 150 knots, maximum altitude as 10,000 feet, and maximum range as 135 nm. Certification is expected in 2024, with entry into service in 2025. So far, Lilium has raised a reported $390 million. The company said it plans a network of \u201cvertiports\u201d that will let passengers fly between key cities in Florida. The first vertiport will be somewhere in South Florida.\"",

        "selftext": "Barrons\n\n President Biden\u2019s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it\u2019s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for. \n\nDon\u2019t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year\u2019s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed. \n\nFor instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald\u2019s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino\u2019s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-biden-corporate-tax-plan-51630663201?mod=RTA",

strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Hey guys, who of you do never watch porn or never go on YouTube? Well, I guess, none of you. However, 3.7 billion people do not have any access to the Internet; poor dudes no porn, and no YouTube. Well, guess what, one company will make money anyway when these guys get access to the internet, and **I am not talking about PornHub, it is Nvidia!**\n\nNvidia is developing very quickly its chips for data centers and eats Intel's market share every day. Here is why, if you are not a retarded living in a cave, you should buy Nvidia (NVDA). \n\n# Crazy quarterly results: \n\nLast quarter's results were monstrous, **bears go back in your cave!**\n\n* Revenues: $6.51 billion versus $6.33 billion expected (dumb-ass analysts were not even close). \n* Revenue growth:  68% annually after a growth of 84% last quarter (get the rocket ready). \n* Adjusted earnings: $1.04, versus $1.01 expected (analysts cannot grasp how much money it makes).\n\n**Dude, have you ever seen a company with such growth?** In comparison, Facebook with its 39% % growth year-over-year looks like a boomer company.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is why Nvidia is a cash cow for the coming years:**\n\n# Why you will make money in 1 year:\n\n\u00b7 Graphic cards (current biggest segment): **growth of 87%** to $3.91 billion. This is crazy growth, and the current valuation seems not to fully consider such growth, especially considering that it is the biggest segment of Nvidia. Nvidia has a PE of 79, it may look big, but Amazon (AMZN) has a PE of 59 and growth is tiny in comparison. Square (SQ) has a PE of more than 200.\n\n# Why you will make money in 3 years: \n\n\u00b7 Compute and network segment (chips for data centers): growth of 46% to $2.6 billion. This is crazy growth for a normal company, but it is not sufficient for Nvidia. However, the future looks sexy.\n\n\u00b7 Data are the future and companies are building data centers all the time. If Amazon invests so heavily in AWS, it is because the cloud is the future! Well, the more Amazon spends on the cloud, the more money Nvidia makes. **Demand for Nvidia chips is exploding**, especially when considering that they are way better than the one from Intel (boomers go home). The cake and the slice of the cake are growing for Nvidia and I will eat the cake as I am a shareholder!\n\n# Why you will make money in 5 years:\n\n\u00b7 Professional use: Industry will progressively get more automated and therefore needs more chips. Annually graphics cards for high-end professional workstations **went up 156% annually** to $519 million. This growth is tremendous and proves that demand is enormous. \n\n\u00b7 Secondly, its automotive business unit. Sales were up 37% from last year's respective quarter. This is poor growth (LOL) for Nvidia but the future looks awesome. If you think two seconds, you will realize that the future is not about EVs, the true revolution will be autonomous cars! And who will be the true winner? Tesla? No! Nio? No! Nvidia? Yeah boy, you got it! Considering the potential of this sector and how crazy people get \u201cjust\u201d with EVs, **Nvidia will not go to the moon but through the whole universe**, once people understand the potential of this division! \n\n# TLDR:\n\nBears have been repeating that Nvidia has been too expensive for a while. They have been repeating that it is not rational for the stock to double in 12 months and blablabla. Well, if they were not retarded, they would see that they are still **tons of catalysts** and the more time passes, the more we will use Nvidia products. So bears are gay and bulls are strong! \n\nPosition: because I do not live in a cave, I bought 50 shares, worth approximately 11,350 USD.",

AEye\u2019s iDAR\u2122 (Intelligent Detection and Ranging) system leverages biomimicry and principles from automated targeting applications used by the military to scan the environment, intelligently focusing on what matters most, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception. iDAR is the **ONLY software configurable LiDAR** (YOU READ THAT RIGHT) with integrated deterministic artificial intelligence, delivering industry-leading performance in range, resolution, and speed.

Luminar has a market cap of 5.86 billion as of today. That is almost 4x what LIDR is at right now.\n\n**Ape's instinct kicked in:**\n\nOkay I know this is retarded. You know what Luminar does? THEY MANUFACTURE LIDAR. What does this have to do with LIDR? LIDR manufactures LIDAR too.

While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, **AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture**. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its [industry-leading range](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aeye.ai%2Fpress%2Fvsi-issues-independent-report-verifying-aeye-lidar-performance%2F&amp;esheet=52494954&amp;newsitemid=20210921005466&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=industry-leading+range&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f27492b3807e03e72c27093bbea60d99), resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence.\u201d\n\nAEye\u2019s patent portfolio can generally be organized into four groups:\n\n**1. Intelligent Modular Architecture**\n\nThis group of patents relate to AEye\u2019s intelligent modular bistatic architecture, system design, and its solid-state performing MEMs-based agile LiDAR. While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its industry-leading range, resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence. Equally important, AEye\u2019s design allows for flexibility in hardware packaging and vehicle placement options, unlike some LiDAR sensors that are limited to roof placement. These patents include protection of the overall architecture, of feedback techniques to keep the scanning where desired during vehicle vibration and temperature variation, as well as the ability to control detection pulse width and receiver bandwidth.\n\n**2. Open System and Extended Data Capabilities**\n\nA second group of patents focus on AEye\u2019s software definable AI technology and iDAR\u2019s ability to integrate other existing sensors, such as radar, cameras, and IMUs. These patents address AEye\u2019s unique co-boresighted design, wherein an HD camera and LiDAR receiver share the same optical axis, creating true color point clouds which enhance classification capabilities and eliminate the need for post-processing parallax correction. By co-boresighting the camera with the LiDAR receiver, AEye moves intelligence into the sensor. This enables the sensor to detect and immediately request additional data about objects and anomalies, then issue \"fast path\" priority message alerts to inform the motion planning system. By pushing detected threats to the top of the data stack under consideration by the motion planning system, AEye reduces central processing burdens, and speeds time to reaction.\n\n**3. Enhanced Data Quality**\n\nThe third group encompasses innovative features such as scan agility, which enables the sensor to \"acquire\" pre-classification attributes useful in accelerating perception systems. For example, AEye is able to pinpoint intra frame velocity by capturing both radial and lateral velocity, where most threats occur while driving. These patents build a software-defined layer upon the bistatic platform, and include the ability to optimize shot lists as a function of scenes and environment, novel tracking schemes, and tracking the horizon during car motion. The latter is an important aspect of agility and intelligence, as it reduces the required vertical scan field of view, and therefore reduces frame to frame time. iDAR\u2019s ability to enable software-defined frames and dynamic scan patterns and the platform\u2019s ability to deploy adaptive energy control on a pulse-by-pulse basis enables both the dynamic adjustment of scan patterns and the ability to adapt the laser energy for each pulse for complete interference mitigation.\n\n**4. Optical Data Networking**\n\nThe fourth group enables AEye to expand the capabilities of the AEye sensor to enable the laser to communicate information. This groundbreaking feature is uniquely enabled by AEye\u2019s adaptive LiDAR, in which the laser can be directed with precision. Pulsed message packets enable data to be transferred via line-of-sight. By using optical communications via the LiDAR system, AEye sensors can leverage a readily available, secure and reliable communications channel, which does not compete with the congested bandwidth of WiFi, cellular, and/or satellite communications, to transmit, receive, and/or transceive data.\n\n\"We set out to build a flexible architecture that could be expanded and adapted over time, adding new innovations. Our IP strategy, we believe, places us years ahead of others building single use hardware,\" said Dr. Allan Steinhardt, chief scientist at AEye. \"We will continue to push forward aggressively with developing and protecting competitive intellectual property to advance AEye\u2019s technological leadership. We are creating a thorough and rigorously defensible patent portfolio covering the architecture and software that underlie our solution.\"",

        "selftext": "I've spent over a year thinking about this, where I initially began as Facebook being my main holding. As an engineer I saw:\n\n- visionary, young CEO\n- their influence on the internet via the React development environment\n- their influence on networking via WhatsApp and low latency considerations (the number one reason I left Snapchat for Instagram many years ago in Mexico)\n- their historic imprint on social media \n- the VR hardware for future proofing\n\n\nAs an investor I saw:\n\n- an application with perverse incentives \n\n\nUltimately, after comparing FB to big tech, I feel that FB has the weakest moat compared to, say the logistics power of Amazon, the intelligence for Google, or IoT for Apple. FB has connection. \n\n- Slack in workspaces\n- Roblox in metaverse\n- Pinterest in social commerce\n- Discord in chat\n- TikTok in shorts\n- YouTube/Twitch in longforms\n- Reddit with communities\n- Twitter in messaging\n- Snapchat in snapshot media\n- Tinder in dating\n\nThe list goes on and on. The difference here is that these platforms are all EXCEPTIONALLY good at incentivizing their niche. Pinterest isn't just social e-commerce, it's also a search engine for ideas. Roblox isn't just a kids game, it's an education platform. Etc etc.\n\n\nPeople make the mistake that Facebook will eventually go the way of Myspace. This is wrong. It will remain as a dinosaur and fundamental to software, similar to that of Oracle or Intel. We already begin to see this at the application level where acquisitions of things like GIPHY inserts Facebook into the interfaces of applications like TikTok or Slack.\n\nMy view is that FB will see the beginning of the end with it's assertion into the metaverse.

        "selftext": "Barrons\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it\u2019s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for.\n\nDon\u2019t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year\u2019s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed.\n\nFor instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald\u2019s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino\u2019s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-biden-corporate-tax-plan-51630663201?mod=RTA",

So what's going on? Well... Lucid is having a PR event at their AZ factory this week. Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-announces-production-preview-week-at-amp-1](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-announces-production-preview-week-at-amp-1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR;**\n\n# LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredits for this DD, and a shoutout, goes to [u/ddroukas](https://www.reddit.com/user/ddroukas/). I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;begin\\_plagiarism&gt;*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjvtldyn53q71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dc3f908a5b18e043ea1a2041f5af479d07ec99a\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson  promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/742fsz2s53q71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee54d570338efd1f787a0d4a97c5118525c0bc46\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oafhgqbr53q71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dadc97bad09abd70b1ee188a949316f617e22f1b\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwmzid2t53q71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b009d4938c971575d670084d7bd931e54aacf087\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bfkjqzt53q71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b3d680faa5175e0bc8b9d67ad399fd31555f49\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mvvbpcv53q71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e542a44f9994017ad9185655a64c2596e80f58\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ic5i9cuw53q71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e18a5a865422e50420de66ffd9720dbf8e96f3a\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A \\*(see below)\\*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

But is this really true? Can markets go anywhere but up?\n\nSo far since the beginning of 2020\n\nOil is up 103%\n\nGas 94 %\n\ncopper which is key in all our electronics is up 126%\n\niron the most used metal is up 150%\n\ncoffee is up 101%\n\ncorn is up 78%\n\nwheat 49%\n\nand sugar 87%\n\nThe housing market is up, the collectible market is up and the stock market does not look any different.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 has recovered above pre covid levels and gained 100 % from the bottom all the while setting 43 all time highs year to date literally a new all time high every 3.5 days in 2021 and on track to beat the record of 77 yearly all time highs in 1995.\n\nRunning hot? Maybe a little... Or maybe the economy is just growing at a really fast pace? Looking at the ratio of market value to GDP however the markets are extended over a large margin to where they should be in relation to GDP.\n\nSo whats going on here? Are we really in an everything bubble that is going to pop and if so how can you invest so that you make money? Before we can answer these questions we need to understand what a bubble is.\n\nWhats a bubble\n\nA bubble is defined as an economic cycle characterised by a rapid increase in market value particularly of asset prices. It is commonly accepted that bubbles arise due to the psychology of investors. They can appear across single assets, asset classes or entire markets.\n\nBubble Cycles\n\nBubbles always follow more or less the same pattern as we will see when we look at some bubbles that have occurred throughout history. At first things start slow as the smart money and early adopters get in on the trade.\n\nMore and more professional investors start to pile in as the price starts to increase leading to awareness of the opportunity to rise until it breaks into the public.\n\nAs more and more people learn about the trade and jump in because of greed and fear of missing out price starts to really take off and run away from fundamental valuations. It is this stage where mass psychology gets more and more amplified feeding into itself leading to enthusiasm turning into greed and delusion as prices reach higher and higher.\n\nThe stock market is a zero-sum game the profits of one market participants are anothers losses. The more retail is buying the more profits the smart money are taking.\n\nThis then is one of the most telling signs of a bubble: retail investors coming in and pushing prices ever higher left to hold the bag when the smart money ultimately leads the market lower in taking all their profits.\n\nFamed investor Jim Chanos is warning about exactly this and just said in an interview with CNBC \u201cThe problem with getting more people, retail, involved is that it always seems to happen toward the end of every cycle. Retail wasn\u2019t there at \u201909 at the bottom. They weren\u2019t there in \u201902 after the dot-com bubble collapsed. They were certainly there at \u201999,\u201d- (Buying at the top that is) He goes on to say:\n\n\u201c(So) the problem in the last few cycles as I see it is that we get promotors and insiders and people who have done very well cashing out as retail is buying.\u201d\n\nPast bubbles and crashes\n\nLets take a look at some of these past bubbles to see how they stack up to where we are today.\n\nWhat is widely considered to be the mother of all bubbles became known in history as tulip mania. It is one of the prime examples showcasing how irrational behaviour leads to asset prices rising to unsustainable levels before they finally collapse.\n\nIn 1630 tulips which had only been introduced to Europe in the 1600's were starting to be perceived as special and rare. This prompted speculation in the tulip market shortly after leading prices to increase by 2000 % between November 1636 and February 1637 before plummeting by 99 % in May 1637. During this period of time some tulips were costing as much as a house clearly showcasing the disconnect from fundamental values and the greed and mania involved which are key characteristics of bubbles. One can't help but see the parallels in looking at prices that some digital or physical collectibles are commanding these days.\n\nCrxxptopunk and Axie Infinity are just two examples of NFT's that can cost much more than even the most lavish of mansions. The most expensive crxxpto punk so far has been sold for 8 million dollars. The most expensive NFT so far Beeple\u2019s, Everydays \u201d The First 5000 Days\u201d sold for a staggering 69 million dollars. But also many physical collectibles are commanding hefty premiums with the most expensive Pokemon card having been sold for 369.000 dollars. Almost a bargain in comparison to some NFT'S.\n\nWell to be fair though at least when the price of NFT's approaches its fair value somewhere closer to zero you will always still be the proud owner of your virtual good whereas the tulip will not only have lost its value but have withered away completely.\n\nJapan\n\nIn our modern time many speculative bubbles have been attributed to overly lax and stimulative financial policies of central banks. Japan's economic bubble of the 1980's is a prime example for this. After Japan entered a recession in 1986 the government countered with huge monetary and fiscal stimulus. The resulting free and abundend liquidity led to rampant speculation in the japanese stock and real estate market with prices increasing by 300 % between 1985 and 1989 and retail going all in. The bubble burst when the fiscal stimulus was withdrawn in 1991 ushering in what is now known as the lost decade due to slow economic growth and deflation. Today 30 years later the Japanese market is still trading below its 1991 highs.\n\nDot com bubble\n\nIn the 90s the internet was a rising star and with it many companies trying to commercialise its tremendous potential. Venture capitalists caught on early and in easy monetary conditions were throwing money at dot com startups. The public started catching on in 1995 and retail trading became more and more popular. Everybody was sure that there was nowhere but up for internet stocks no matter what they did or whether they even had revenues. In 1997 record amounts of capital flowed into the NASDAQ. New online brokers were making it more accessible for the average Joe to buy and sell shares and everybody was buying into the trade of a life time. At the height of the bubble their advertisements were showing that trading is an easy way to riches. Between 1995 and 2000 the NASDAQ rose by 500% from below 1000 to over 5000 points. When nobody was left to buy the bubble finally burst and the NASDAQ lost nearly 80%. At this point even blue-chip tech stocks like Intel were down by 80%. What followed was an extended bear market and a slow recovery. It should take until 2015 for markets to recover to previous levels.\n\nThe dot com bubble actually spawned another bubble on its own as investors fleeing stocks piled into the real estate market. This became known as the US housing bubble which in the mid 2000s collapsed leading to a worldwide economic crisis today known as the great recession.\n\nTo support the world economy during this time the central banks of the world started implementing quantitive easing basically increasing the money supply by lowering interest rates and purchasing assets in order to help the economy recover. At this point unprecedented amounts of money were newly created and injected into the economy. Shockingly this actually continued until 2018 when the US Fed started to taper its asset purchases which caused a liquidity crisis in the markets that after 10 years of a non stop FED powered rally were not prepared to come back to reality.\n\nAs we have seen these bubbles develop and burst over and over again following the same pattern. The reason for this is that financial markets like the whole bubble dynamic are entirely driven by human psychology which is best illustrated in the different phases of bubble or market cycles.\n\nWhere are we in the cycle\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nWe have been in a central bank induced bull market since we came out of the last recession in 2008. In 2020 COVID hit and as result the markets collapsed and millions of people lost their jobs as the world battled lockdowns that led to stores and factories closing.\n\nThe worlds central banks jumped in swiftly - injecting more liquidity into the system than ever before. They cut interest rates to zero and started large asset purchase programs in addition to the government relief programs handing out money to everybody.\n\nJust between March and June 2020 the money supply in the US increased by 300 % the largest spike ever. 40 % of all dollars in existence were printed within the last 12 months.\n\nThis flood of new free money quickly found its way into the stock markets since due to low interest rates lower risk assets are not yielding returns. Leaving investors no alternatives but to rotate to riskier higher yielding assets which today is known as TINA: there is no alternative.\n\nAs we have seen earlier this flood of money combined with supply chain shortages caused by Covid lead to rampant price inflation throughout different asset classes within a short amount of time. It sure looks like we are in bubble territory but where are we within the cycle?\n\nOne key characteristic of any bubble nearing its peak is the involvement of the general public or retail crowd. Therefor the degree to which retail investors play a part in the current boom cycle plays a key role in understanding where we are in the bubble. So what does the data tell us\n\nRetail participation in bubbles\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic the amount of retail brokerage accounts opened has skyrocketed. Robin Hood now has 18 million users almost doubling their amount of users before the pandemic started. They introduced fractional shares allowing you to start investing with as little as 1 dollar. Their advertising message is everybody is an investor and I guess in a bubble everybody is. The interest for trading has spiked online and offline. You know its getting sketchy when your little niece asks you for stock tips.\n\n(Infamous wallstreetbets subreddit now has 11 million members up from only 800 k two years earlier. Wallstreetbets users were already gabmling /yoloing away their life savings and at some point even started finding ways to exploit the robin hood app in order to borrow more money to risk even more. When robinhood posted on wallstreetbets and asked users to stop doing this robinhood ended up being banned from the subreddit. Sure looks like a little mania going on.)\n\nBut there is not only more retail trading the new traders are also younger and more inexperienced. A large part of todays market participants has never even seen a market correction of more than 10 % let alone a true recession. It is no surprise than that these investors are overly optimistic and can not believe the market can go anywhere but up.\n\n(It sure seems though that history is set to repeat and most of the retail crowd will be left holding the bag instead of taking home the tendies. As an old saying on wallstreet goes:\n\n&gt;\u201cA man with money meets a man with experience. The man with the experience leaves with the money, while the man with money leaves with experience.\u201d)\n\nThe only thing more telling than the growing number of retail traders is the amount of money that has been flowing into the market.\n\nOver the last 25 years global equities had inflows of 727 billion USD cumulatively. Now hold on tight because this is truly crazy. Global equity inflows for 2021 annualized amount to 1.015 trillion USD. Yes thats right trillion not billion almost 300 billion more than have been flowing into the market over the last 25 years combined coming in in just one year. Over 80 % of these flows have gone into passive funds, ALL US, ALL LARGE CAP. At the same time margin debt has risen to historic highs as well. Market participants have never been this leveraged before.\n\nThese days in the light of the FED support there is only one mantra driving the crowd: buy the tulip uhhh... dip.\n\nCrash scenario\n\nIt seems then that retail is indeed all in or at least getting pretty close. Looking at these unprecedented huge inflows into equities and the retail trading frenzy it sure looks like we are in the last cycle of the bubble but how and when is it going to pop?\n\nThere are currently many challenges ahead that might trigger a bigger correction or crash leading to these bubbles to burst. Lower vaccine efficacy and the spread of the delta variant are impacting supply chains putting more pressure on already elevated prices and slowing down the Chinese economy. The FED starting to taper into a slowing recovery might as well be a recipe for the crash that we have been waiting for.\n\nBut whatever event is going to trigger the sell off every day\u00a0margin debt is growing the resulting margin call avalanche that will ensue is getting bigger and bigger making sure that whatever correction we will see will not be a small one and might even trigger a recession.\n\nHow to profit from this\n\nIt sure seems like the central banks are running out of options and it will be very interesting to see how they respond to this.\n\nSo when is this going to pop? It is very difficult to time market tops or bottoms due to the psychological nature of market cycles. As we have seen when looking at historic bubbles they can stretch on for years before they reach their peak. As they say on wallstreet: the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nIn the past the yield curve has been a great leading indicator to detect a recession ahead. Of course there is no guarantee this will be predictive again but there is a good chance since ultimately it is down to smart investor behaviour. In any case watch out for the yield curve inverting as a warning signal.\n\nNobody knows what event or chain of events will cause enough market participants to panic sell and trigger a crash. However being aware of these cycles and roughly what part of the cycle we are in allows you to manage your portfolio in a way that you can make money instead of loosing it. As promised lets look at how to do exactly that.\n\nLets assume that your portfolio is already well diversified. Now your goal is to maximise your profits and minimise your risk therefor you want to have liquidity available to buy into a crash and at the same time protect your existing portfolio from losses. There are different ways to do this but my preferred way is to keep taking profits on a regular basis on all my positions. The resulting profits are partly held in cash or liquid inflation protected assets and the other part is used to build a position that is going long volatility. The current market has very low volatility. The only way is up and there are only minute corrections to the downside that are immediately bought up. This means the VIX a measurement for volatility is trading at relatively low levels. A big correction or crash in the overall market will lead the VIX to spike up. Thus going long volatility while buying the VIX with futures, options or ETF's earns our portfolio excellent protection from the crash. If you balance the VIX position and your portfolio out correctly you can easily cover all losses with the VIX position all the while being liquid enough to buy into the crash in order to profit from the recovery that inevitably will ensue.",

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",

Make sure to read the Government Intervention section. This is critical to understanding the semiconductor market as a whole.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a \u201conce in a generation\u201d investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.\n\n\u200b\u200b**Government Intervention Timeline**\n\n*March 31, 2021* \\[Source\\]([https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/))\n\n* White House proposes a $50B subsidy plan for research and development to strengthen the U.S supply chain under the CHIPS Act.  \n\n   * The CHIPS Act *(June 11, 2020)* offers a tax income credit for semiconductor equipment and manufacturing.\n\n*April 12, 2021* \\[Source 1\\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAa10ljxLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAa10ljxLA)) \\[Source 2\\](\\[Source\\]([https://www.ttnews.com/articles/biden-reassures-chip-summit-bipartisan-support-new-funds](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/biden-reassures-chip-summit-bipartisan-support-new-funds))\n\n* Biden joins the Virtual CEO Summit on \"Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience.\"\n* Biden states that this plan is a \"once-in-a-generation investment in America's future.\"\n* CEOs who attended the meeting include General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor CEO James D.

production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/772aqq7nwno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7319d506eb7da567c5ab1a86d4e4f1d08dc06e29\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": " \n\nI've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a \"pre-squeeze\" movement, there is likely far more to come.\n4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.\n5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13% with the same elevated cost to borrow.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO &amp; $GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nBe warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

        "selftext": "This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\n**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put\u2026**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a \u201cBlack swan event\u201dby purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars\u2026Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I\u2019m saying that maybe it\u2019s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don\u2019t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m\u2026 another bearish catalyst for the market\u2026 I literally could go on and on guys\u2026. It\u2019s pretty obvious at this point\u2026we\u2019ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December. \n\nEdit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit\u2026",

        "selftext": "Elon Musk told employees that he agrees with Ark Invest that Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share \u201cif they execute really well.\u201d The CEO has often commented on Tesla\u2019s stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. \n\nIn 2020, when Tesla\u2019s stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was \u201ctoo high\u201d. It sent Tesla\u2019s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.\n\nWall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.\n\nThis week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: \u201cOur estimate for Tesla\u2019s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,\u201d In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That\u2019s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.\n\nIn an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark\u2019s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: \u201cIf we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.\u201d A $3,000 share price would put Tesla\u2019s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. \n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nSince Ark\u2019s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk\u2019s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla\u2019s stock price. He believes that \u201cif executed really well\u201d, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/)",

And instead of being afraid of stock market crash. My thoughts were why am I keeping so much cash in a savings account if inflation is eating away at it each year.\n\nMy thinking is even if my portfolio crashes 90%. I would still have enough to cover 6 months of expenses. But the thing is if that worst case happens and SPY/VOO/VTI crashed 90% there might be bigger issues in the world than the money I lost. The best case is my capital appreciates higher than the .01% as well as higher than inflation than it would have gotten in a savings account. Anyone else do this?",

        "selftext": "\nThis journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.\n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high. I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices. Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\nThis was yesterday, Friday, September 3. \n\n$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\nAm I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!! \n\nFor fucks sake people, THIS IS HUGE!! This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to read\u2026 I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. I\u2019m actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally read\u2026I wish I was joking. Whatever\u2026weird. \n\nGross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026\n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\nSo investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nThe lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\nThey reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you. \n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\nLet me be clear\u2026I personally don\u2019t believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I don\u2019t want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do I\u2019ll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. \n\nSince the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\nShort term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\nLong term: \n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS. You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\nMy last position:\n\n$2,500 in Cash.\n\nSimply put\u2026cash is a position. People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. Timing this is almost impossible\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!",

        "selftext": "I have been avidly learning the great minds of WallStreetBets and have gained extensive knowledge on investing, risk management, and portfolio growth. WSB has introduced me to the great world of options, and it has completely changed my life. \n\n**Pre-WSB**\nI am ashamed to admit\u2026 but I used to be a\u2026 *Boglehead*. In my early investing days (~5 months ago) the dinosaur Vanguard lentil eaters told me it is *impossible* to beat the market. They all accepted an early defeat that they\u2019ll never be rich, so they default to 6% yearly returns and averaging into the occasional 40% crash. Rather than risking my money on something *totally risky* like Apple (which holds $300B+ in cash and literally only goes up), I should own Apple and 5000 other companies that nobody knows or cares about.\n\nUnfortunately, these boomers convinced me and I threw my entire portfolio into VT and BND. \u201cOwn the market and you will get rich\u2026. when you\u2019re 500 years old\u201d. After holding for 2 weeks and losing 1.3%, I sold all my shares and started a new adventure. \n\n\n**Learning from WSB**\nAs I came to WSB, I saw a skilled trader lose $100k in seconds. His life: destroyed. In the next post, I saw another investor make $100k in seconds. His life: changed! I was in awe. The Bogleheads made me lose 1.2% of my account and told me to \u201chold for the next 60 years\u201d. Meanwhile I saw someone make 10,000% in a few minutes on some SPY calls. So I did what any logical person would do and opened a Robinhood account. I promptly applied for options, and Vlad personally gave me approval. He told me that life in Bulgaria was very difficult, but through options he was able to get out of the poor eurozone and into the United States. \n\nMy first trade was a massive success. I made 20% on an SPY call. I made 3 years worth of the Bogleheads dream in minutes. These losers can\u2019t compete. In the subsequent few months, I have 100x my account. Through a series of 0-1 DTE SPY calls, I have found great success trading complex financial derivatives that I do not understand. It\u2019s amazing. My life has been changed and I cannot thank WSB enough. \n\n\n**THANK YOU**\nI would like to thank WSB for fundamentally changing my life. Not only have you made me 100x richer, but you have taught me the importance of risk taking. I would still be a Vanguard boglehead loser if I didn\u2019t discover the power of 0-1DTE SPY calls (I do not buy puts since they\u2019re anti-American \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaa). If WSB was not filled with such intellectuals, I would have not trusted the numerous great DDs.\n\nThis leads me to my question:\n**Why doesn\u2019t everyone trade options?**\nI don\u2019t think it makes sense to buy and hold something for DECADES and hope for a 100% return after 20 years. I have made 100x in 3 months and could not imagine how pathetic I would look still holding VT and BND. I have leveraged all my accounts through a series of all in trades. I now have a Tesla arriving soon all thanks to the YOLO and WSB. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t everyone do this?! It seems like free money.",

        "selftext": "Uranium.\n\nSure, there are no flashing LEDs like CRSR adds to all of their products, but that\u2019s because we don\u2019t need it. Uranium already glows in the dark! (No, radioactive things don\u2019t really glow in the dark. You have to mix trace radioactive material with a fluor to do that.)\n\nMaybe Uranium isn't as sexy as some over-hyped under-developed threadmill with an iPad glued to it that kills babies, and it is lacking in buzzwords like \"cloud data analytics,\" but uranium is energy. And everything we do takes energy, and this is the cleanest, densest, most likely candidate for the immediate future. There are already big incumbents in energy that need to get shouldered aside, so this will be a slower play than the up 50% in a week flavors of the month (which then fall 90%), but this is the real deal. With calls you can still get that 50%, or 500%, but shares will take some time. That said, many of these names are up 15% in a week, just barely OTM calls up 500%. That's not exactly [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\nUranium has a serious bull case of ahead of it. A new fund is in town (Sprott) who is buying up all the physical uranium. Get ready to gap up. Yes you have heard some of this before, and I peddled Uranium a full on year ago, but this fund is a market mover and it changes everything.\n\nSorry if you saw this quickly deleted multiple times. F'ing automod.\n\nTLDR, 1) since 2019 supply has been below demand for uranium as the market continues to deal with a supply overhang and over-investment by miners from the previous market cycle. COVID then reduced supply by a further 30% through mine closures that have continued for 2021 and the supply overhang is finally gone. 2) More nuclear reactors are being built worldwide than decommissioned, developing nations have hopped on board the nuclear train, and 3) if any country is serious about getting to carbon neutral then the only realistic avenue is via massive expansion of the nuclear fleet. Lastly, 4) there is a new physical trust (Sprott) busy buying up all of the uranium and driving up the spot price. It\u2019s working.\n\nUranium spot is $34.60 right now, 2007 was $137. That\u2019s a lot of upside baby. Oh, and did I mention that the Uranium market is small? Tiny. Super tiny. WSB could blow this thing up. There isn\u2019t an entire industry of traders, hedgers, and dilatants (that\u2019s a nice way of saying degenerates) trading U like there are for oil or other commodities.\n\n**1. The Setup**: Uranium is already on a 5 year trend line of tendies\n\nUranium has been in a bear market since 2007. It started to finally sell through the over supply and over investment of the last market cycle and has been climbing from its low of $18.50 in 2016. This was already a 4 year trend line, and then COVID came along.\n\nCOVID changed the uranium market in two main ways. First, it dramatically reduced global supply by about 30% in 2020 and 2021 due to mine closures by many of the majors and juniors. These closures have allowed the sticky overhang from the last decade to finally get put on the spot market. Second, there appears to be an OPEC+ of uranium forming. Miners, no doubt still traumatized from last time they aggressively expanded productions, are not opening new minds even as spot prices surge. Instead, they continue to provide quarterly guidance that they are operating below capacity for the rest of the year, and are selling old supply instead of starting new mines. They aren\u2019t formally a cartel like OPEC is, but there seems to be some game theory going on here. It is miner\u2019s best interest to try to exactly match the demand of U on a global scale and then be able to dictate the price. Since fuel costs are just 2% of the operating costs of a nuclear reactor, utilities can also stomach significant increases in spot prices without effecting their generation rates of \\~ $.02/KwH.\n\nU is $34.60 right now which is 75.24% below its peak in 2007. In a market with all-time highs all over the place, U has a long way to run. What will miner prices be if U hits $100+ again? Massive.\n\n**2. New Demand**: Global demand has outpaced supply\n\nPlanned Reactor Starts in Gross MWe of new capacity (from world-nuclear.org)\n\n* 2021: 5,711\n* 2022: 13,559\n* 2023: 13,276\n* 2024: 7,569\n* 2025: 5,112\n* 2026: 6,997\n* 2027: 4,100\n\nCredit Suisse offers their own global view of supply &amp; demand here. Get your sunglasses on as this assumes the US fleet is shrinking into 2030. That likely won\u2019t be the case. See comments #1, automod doesn't like my links.\n\nFirst, if you are from the US then you are likely biased against nuclear. Get over it. The US has a very old fleet and has been periodically retiring plants rather than performing maintenance. I\u2019ll get back to the US later, but the global view is very, very positive. Globally, many developing nations are starting to add, or start, a nuclear fleet. It\u2019s cheap and it doesn\u2019t pollute. India, Slovakia, Belarus, and Pakistan all have new plants started or starting in the next year. France continues to expand and sell energy, while China seems serious about cutting CO2 emissions and is massively expanding their existing fleet, as well as breaking ground on the world\u2019s first SMR earlier this year.\n\nSo back to the USA\u2014the US mostly acts as a drag. A reactor in New York just closed, and others throughout the country are always wavering on edge of retirement. This is set to change, but it depends upon politics, so we\u2019ll see (and the right likes nuclear too, it\u2019s not just about CO2). The Secretary of Energy is committed to keeping every single US plant operating as it prepares to transition to a fleet of fast breeding, small modular reactors (SMR\u2019s) in the \u201clate 2020s, early 2030s.\u201d (this just means highly fuel efficient with far, far less waste, and reactors the size of a 3-4 story apartment building instead of a city block. Each will power 500,000+ homes, so they can be \u201cclose\u201d to cities they power and also reduce infrastructure costs.) She is working with legislatures to allow all currently operating plants to essentially receive carbon credits as an incentive for utilities to keep the plants running and well maintained until the SMR roll-out.\n\nYes, this is a long horizon for the US, but the US is only one part of the uranium market and a very minor part of this bull case. Globally, supply/demand are already tight, and the world fleet is slated to expand. Utilities can see the writing on the wall and will want to start placing orders now for future delivery (spot market for Uranium is quite different from other commodities\u2014purchasing, delivery, enrichment, and feeding take years. You can bet these utilities are looking at supply/demand graphs and already panicking. Spot is going to start gapping up instead of ticking.\n\n**3. Green Energy**: The Elephant in the Room\n\nNuclear power is the greenest mass-scalable energy on the planet. Hydro destroys entire riparian ecosystems, wind and solar are both CO2 heavy in terms of manufacturing and are slow ROI on the carbon expenditure as well as having short functional commercial lifespans, while geothermal is quite literally tied to very specific locations (OK, I don\u2019t know anything about tidal, but other than reading about some plans being nixed by NIBY Boomers I\u2019m not seeing it either).\n\nThese renewable forms of power generation have another cost: land. Aside from geothermal, these are not power dense generators. Here is an article working through the cost in land to electrify just British Colombia\u2019s transport grid. The takeaway is that nuclear wins by a landslide: 2.4 m2/kWh versus solar\u2019s 36.9m2, hydro\u2019s 54 m2, and wind\u2019s 72.1 m2. If you want to electrify the US transport grid then you can either build some nuclear plants, or convert all of Nevada to a giant solar farm. I mean, what is Nevada good for anyway?\n\nNumbers on energy density coming from here: damn you automods, see comments for links.\n\nThe latest generation of nuclear plants, SMRs, are small and safe. They can be built alongside cities to save CO2 and money that would otherwise go into infrastructure. How many more fires are we going to see every fire season as PG&amp;E and other utilities run millions of miles of hot lines all over the country? This too is a cost of the current way to locating and distributing energy. This all changes with SMRs, and all for the better.\n\nBiden has made some surprisingly strong claims about aiming the US at net zero, and we\u2019re hardly a climate activist country. If this happens in other countries, and perhaps the US, then it means we are looking at hundreds upon hundreds of new nuclear power plants in the next two decades, not just the few dozen currently in the planning stages over the coming 2020s. This will be the renaissance of nuclear, and it is coming.\n\nThink about it. If there is any chance in hell of reducing carbon emissions, then nuclear is the path forward. Everything else is a half measure.\n\n**4. The Dinosaur in the Room**: Sprott Physical Uranium Trust\n\nThis is a new fund from an old hand in physical trusts. Sprott\u2019s Physical Uranium Trust (U.U \u2013 Canadian listed, NYSE coming in \\~4m) purchases uranium on the spot market and then warehouses it. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole plan. This is gigantic.\n\nAs shares of U.U are issued Sprott takes that money and buys uranium, which increases their NAV. So long as they have a premium to NAV they keep buying. They\u2019ve only been buying physical uranium for two weeks now, but **they\u2019ve already purchased 13.3% of the estimated global uranium production for all of 2021**. Read that sentence again. 20.59m lbs of the projected world supply of 154m lbs. Jesus Christ are these guys a market force to be reckoned with. How is this not illegal?\n\nLook at spot price versus their holdings. They march up and up in tandem. Spot has gone up 7.1% in the last month, with all of those gains coming within days of when Sprott started buying.\n\nSee comment link for google spreadsheet of Sprott and spot rate.\n\n**5. There are short sellers here**\n\nSome entities sell naked uranium deliveries. In a market as slow moving and opaque as uranium is this probably seemed like a good idea at the time. How much of a factor would this be? I don't honestly know. Uranium is not like other commodities with all their nifty reporting and data. We'll find out?\n\n**Positions or Ban:** OK, we know you all just skipped to the end anyway\n\nGo long anything uranium.\n\nMiners/Exploration:\n\n* CCJ\n* NXE\n* Google as many are too small by marketcap for me to list here, but they are mostly small for a reason\n* U.U (This is Sprott. Buy this, but only if Canadian. Imagine what will happen when this gets NYSE listed in 2022!)\n\nURA: ETF of major and minor miners, equipment production, all things uranium\n\n*Options*:\n\nAs we all know, there are only a few times when dealers work with your play instead of hedging against it, and one of those is when you buy far OTM calls. When you buy a far OTM call the dealer will also purchase or adjust their position matching your direction.\n\nSo, if you are buying calls (I would recommend calls *and* shares) then far OTM calls skew delta in our favor.\n\nThat out of the way, the Uranium market is slow, but Sprotts has started to speed things up.\n\nURA 10/22 $25c is about as high as I would go without going longer dated.\n\nAfter that, June 2022 $30+ is cheapish. No doubt you will all ignore this and buy something idiotic like front month $30. Really, don\u2019t do that.\n\nNXE 2/22 or 12/22 $5 or $7. I did a few call debit spreads of buying 12/22 $5, selling $7. Probably should be greedier, but it seems so safe. What could go wrong?\n\n*Shares*:\n\nI like NXE from the miners/explorers the most, but CCJ is also a very solid miner. Google smaller marketcap ones on your own.\n\nMy positions:\n\n* URA &amp; NXE shares (some other too small of marketcap to list)\n* URA 10/22 $25c\n* URA 6/22 $28c &amp; 30c\n* NXE 9/17 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $7c",

        "selftext": "The Tesla Cybertruck delay was already a known fact, but CEO Elon Musk's latest reported comments add a few more details to the picture. Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\n\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\n\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/)\n\nElon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that\u2019s only going to happen with a big \u201cif.\u201d  \nThe new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.   \nWhen first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.\n\nTesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  \nPeople who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  \nThe vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn\u2019t a priority for Tesla.

It's a deep sea mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9-9.50 range).\n\nThe key thing here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million PIPE shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).\n\nOkay, so why do we care?

Market makers were selling calls based on the prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've potentially sold much more than the entire current float:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/823tys3ci9n71.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=493a7a66e8ffbe60cf7c4ae599e422c9b9779f09\n\nThere's 25k calls for 9/17 between $10 and $12.50.  That's 2.5 million shares.  There's another 8.2k calls for 9/17 between $14 and $15.  That's another 820k shares.\n\n**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls.**  **If it's over $15 by Friday, MMs will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**\n\nThat's just September.  Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...\n\n**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls.**\n\n(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).\n\nI'm gonna be honest, I have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SP ACs recently is unprecedented).  MMs have to keep this pinned under $10 by Friday or all hell will break loose.\n\nEasiest way/lowest risk way to play this is just buy stock (which should go up 200-300% in a \"gamma + short squeeze\" scenario).  September calls are super risky but will pay off in 5/10/15 baggers if the stock actually gets past $15 and rockets.\n\nOctober calls are lower risk than September but should still turn in 4/6/8 baggers if it gets past $15.\n\nPositions: 1000 shares of stock. 250 $12.50 calls, 200 $15 calls for Sept.  \n\nAs always do your own DD, I think this is the most explosive setup ever, but it may just stay pinned under $10 and then the calls are worthless.  Good luck.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post. Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.\n\nWe all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called \u201cPlays\u201d this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!\n\nPlease try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:\n\nMy 5 as a Day Trader:\n\nRKT \u2013 This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar\n\nUWMC \u2013 This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents\n\nTIGR \u2013 This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)\n\nCPNG \u2013 I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)\n\nCRSR \u2013 I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)\n\nThese are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore\n\nBILL \u2013 This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100\u2026 I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it\n\nMRNA \u2013 I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100\u2026\n\nSE \u2013 I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus\n\nCMG \u2013 OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 shares\u2026 What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining in the basement????\n\nZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!\n\nI hope this helps others get an idea and thank you everyone.",

        "selftext": "Ever since GMREEEE this sub has been filled with people from r/all calling for the end of payment for order flow for a variety of reasons.  Now the front page has a news article talking about how the SEC chair is thinking about ending payment for order flow.  I just wanted to say that if you're against payment for order flow there's probably a 95 percent chance that you don't know what a call condor spread is.  PFOF gives you no or reduced commissions and also makes the options market more liquid.  Here are some arguments against PFOF that I've seen on this sub:\n\n1. HedGe FuNd GiVe BAd FiL.\n\n       In reality you can set the price for what you want your options to be filled at.  This can be done by making a FUCKING LIMIT ORDER.  There is probably not a single professional option trader that buys or sells options with a market order.  Options are, by their nature, illiquid on a majority of underlyings given that you have thousands of combinations of strikes and dates to choose from.  Again, especially if you trade spreads, you should be placing limit orders for your positions.  Also, if you remove PFOF this liquidity issue will only get worse.  This is just the reality of gutting several billion dollar firms that write and buy options.  Less money in the options market means less liquidity.\n\n2. HooDgE FunD ManiPuLaeT MarkET wItH my OrDeR InForMatIoN\n\n       I can right now go on my think or swim platform and scan for options orders under 10k (or however large you want) and look at the bid/ask spread to tell if this trader bought or sold these options.  If I really wanted to I could go into the API and make a robot that does this for me and organizes all this information into some sort of bullshit spreadsheet.  Small orders like these (the kind retail makes) provide a reasonable guess as to where retail is positioned.  I'm just some jack off wsb troll with a think or swim account and I have already laid how how to detect retail positions.  If I can do it then the big dogs certainly can do the same even without payment for order flow.  \n\n   One more thing: If you lose money on your 10 delta put it's because it was a bad trade, not because some Algo picked out your 5 lot position and spent millions of dollars manipulating the market to shake you out of your 200 dollar position.",

        "selftext": "I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen any explanations on WSB (at least in recent months) about how the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust works, and how it helps to fuel the epic short squeeze going on in Uranium right now.\n\nThe physical trusts offered by Sprott are closed-end funds, meaning that when investors sell the fund, Sprott does not have to go out and also sell Uranium to fund outflows.\n\nIn other words, once uranium hits the Sprott vaults, it might as well be declared retired forever. \n\nThey are structurally diamond handed, which is important for a short squeeze to continue.\n\nSo how does more metal enter the fund?\n\nSprott has filed an \u2018at the money\u2019 share offering where they can issue new shares of the fund any time it trades at a premium to the fund\u2019s net asset value.\n\nEssentially whenever investors get excited and bid up the price of the ETF such that that shares are being bought for more than their underlying value, Sprott will issue new shares, sell them into the market (which helps bring down the premium), and then use this cash to buy more uranium for the fund.\n\nIn the span of a month investors already added enough uranium to the fund to exhaust Sprott\u2019s $300 million offering.\n\nLast week they filed a new offering to increase it from a $300 million program, to a $1,300 million ($1.3 billion) program.\n\nWhile this filing process has been ongoing the past few days, Sprott has not been issuing new shares. So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.\n\nThe premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.\n\nFor perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.\n\nSo 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).\n\nAnd this is a minuscule market, so sprott\u2019s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. \n\nThis of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats \n\nThis is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.\n\nSo what tickers can be offered up here? \n\nNot many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.\n\nOptions? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.\n\n$CCJ is one ticker you\u2019ve likely heard of, and it\u2019s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.  \n\nSprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I\u2019ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can\u2019t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It\u2019s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. \n\nNorthshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker\n\nWant to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they\u2019ve invested in. They also aren\u2019t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.\n\nThis uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what\u2019s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!",

These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.\n\nAnother example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.\n\nInvesting is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** \n\ntrading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.\n\nHere let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. \n\nShit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .\n\nShit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?\n\n**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**\n\nTHis isnt financial advice. This is just a bunch of my opinions i want to share with yall",

        "selftext": "Cam across this today:\n\nTrading memestonks on your phone is all fun and games -- that is, until you get slapped with an $800k tax bill.\n\nHow? If inexperienced traders run afoul of the \u201cwash sale rule,\u201d taxes could outweigh gains.\n\nA what sale?\nA wash sale is when you sell a security at a loss, then buy it or a [\u201csubstantially identical\u201d](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substantiallyidenticalsecurity.asp) security 30 days before or after the sale.\n\nThe wash sale rule means you can\u2019t take a tax deduction on that loss. It\u2019s to stop people from using wash sales to increase tax benefits, but you can trigger it without even knowing it exists.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nYou buy 100 shares at $10/share for $1k\nLater, you sell them at $7/share for $700 -- a loss of $300\nThe next week, you repurchase them at $6/share for $600\nDue to the wash sale rule, that loss is added to the cost basis, meaning your $600 repurchase becomes $900.\n\nWhen you sell your shares again, your original loss is applied to the adjusted cost basis. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll use on your taxes.\n\nSo, how do you get an $800k tax bill?\nThat example\u2019s an outlier, but the unidentified retail trader told financial advisor Brian Wruk he did it by going berserk on Robinhood, per [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2021/03/26/robinhood-trader-may-face-800000-tax-bill/?sh=4792a11a67c7)\n\nThe man opened a Robinhood account in 2020. He put up $30k, but Robinhood gave him $90k on margin. He then did 10 to 50 trades daily.\n\nHe ultimately:\n\nGenerated $45m (yep, million) in gross proceeds\nProfited by $45k\nHad $1.4m in capital gains tax\nAnd a potential tax bill of $800k+\n\u201cHe booked a profit but was disallowed all the losses because he never once waited the 30 days on those stocks to book the loss,\u201d Wruk said.\n\nAnd short-term gains are taxed like ordinary income. Yikes.\n\nThe moral of the story: Let your stocks marinate at least 30 days, lest you become a cautionary tale!\n\n\nAnother article: https://mullooly.net/800k-taxes-45k-profits/",

        "selftext": "Chewy is an e-commerce retailer of pet food and supplies, mainly active in the USA. Last quarter they posted USD 2.14bn in revenue from 19.8 million customers (600k of which were new additions). For Q2 they project 2.15-2.17 billion in revenue for a very modest 1% q-o-q growth. \n\nI think they'll outdo their (very conservative) revenue guidance, but fall short on customer additions for the quarter and revenue guidance for the following quarters. Chewy is currently trading at the upper end of its historical P/S ratio, (save for a brief time in Jan/Feb 2021 when it was even higher than today). It\u2019s P/S of 4.76 is relatively high for its industry (as it is a low margin retailer, not a platform business). It\u2019s actually higher than Amazon, which I would argue is too high to make sense and I expect a short-term downside re-evaluation of Chewy after earnings.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* **Competition catching up**\n\nThe key investment thesis for Chewy has been \"Fast-growing pet e-commerce industry\" and \"growing faster than its competition in its fast-growing industry\". I believe the second reason may be moderating. While Chewy is the clear market leader, I'm seeing several signs that its competitors (in both e-commerce and retail) are slowly catching up. Walmart (biggest brick and mortal pet retailer) just reported a big revenue beat. Petsmart (brick and mortar focused) is looking to increase revenue this year following a bad 2020. Petco reported great earnings two weeks ago. \n\nThese good results could be because the overall market (\"pet ecommerce\") is expanding. I don't think so. The market expansion took place in 2020, the number of adopted pets is on a clear downtrend. If most other big players are doing quite well, I suspect they are doing so at the expense of Chewy. \n\n* **Low net customers additions**\n\nIn Q1 2021 Chewy added a net 600k customers, their lowest absolute increase in two years. I expect them to report even lower additions this quarter as they follow up Q2 of 2020, their biggest quarter of customer additions ever. 1 year is a very typical \"cliff\" during which many former customers start to churn (according to Chewy CEO Sumit Singh). Since they haven't increased their marketing spend significantly this Q, I expect high churn and low gross additions, which is a bad early sign for growth companies. \n\n[Customer additions per quarter](https://preview.redd.it/dkmcffawmxk71.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5521fbd76802f34cacbc31617550af9f34177b9e)\n\n* **Moderating growth rates in a fast-growth industry**\n\nChewy's app store rankings in Q2 have been at its lowest level since February 2019. Who downloads apps from the store? New customers, usually. Remember the part where I think they will have unexpectedly low gross customer additions this quarter?\n\n[Petco App gaining ground on Chewy](https://preview.redd.it/z5yvwgzjnxk71.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38c746658cf948bc19a514b436ada7ed21cc071a)\n\nPetco is clearly aggressively promoting their app which is currently nearly as popular as Chewy's. You can see how their spikes coincide with drops in Chewy's ranking, leading me to believe that Chewy is losing more business than usual to its competition.\n\n* **Profitability**\n\nWhile profitability is less relevant for Chewy, on Q1 earnings they were relatively sanguine about their expected costs for 2021. Since then I expect hiring, material and logistics costs to have gone up quite a bit, which might result in them offering a more pessimistic profitability guidance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary: Chewy has achieved a high PS ratio thanks to its promise of outgrowing its competitors in a market that is already fast-growing in itself. I believe their competitive advantage is eroding ever so slightly and will result in earnings that Wall Street doesn't like. \n\n**Short interest**\n\nChewy currently has what I would consider a relatively large short interest considering its relatively strong fundamentals. As of August, 16.4% of the short was floated. Make of that what you will. \n\n**Risks**\n\n* A lot of Chewy customers actually use autoship, which may distort the data I'm looking at and allow them to surprise to the upside on revenue\n* I do all my shopping for my pets on Chewy\n\n**Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpekcjdcpxk71.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6c05b0d43d825435b4e3ef664c4ca05d062dd67",

        "selftext": "**This might be good news after the rout in China tech since Feb 2021. There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**\n\nBEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.\n\nGlobal investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.\n\n\"Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,\" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.\n\nChina is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.\n\nMeanwhile, CSRC will conduct \"pragmatic\" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.\n\nYi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a \"zero-sum game\", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.\n\nGlobal financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, \"rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries\", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.\n\nYi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.\n\nChina will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated \"Panda bonds\" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.\n\nChina will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.\n\nFang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-will-improve-opening-up-capital-market-securities-regulator-2021-09-06/",

But I'm having trouble finding logical answers to basic questions regarding the theoretical squeeze. It's a cult over in superstonk and GME subs, can't get straight answers. \n\nThe squeeze theory at it's core hinges on hedge funds needing to cover a massive short that includes millions of synthetic Gamestock shares. When it eventually must reconcile, the share price will moon to 5K, 50K, 500K etc. Per share. Some even believe a single share could reach millions of dollars. (!) \n\nMy question I can't seem to get an answer to is: who actually pays this theoretical megafortune out? If billion or trillions are owed to cover, the hedgefunds go under. The market makers go under, and there's a domino effect. The US economy tanks. Is that the idea? Or the gov steps in for a bailout, which at this scale also would be a catastrophic event.

        "selftext": "A lot of people said Tesla is an \"AI\" company, not an electric car company from this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney\\_is\\_to\\_netflix\\_as\\_x\\_is\\_to\\_tesla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney_is_to_netflix_as_x_is_to_tesla/)\n\nThe thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nMy thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?\n\n* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few\n* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and [40+ other companies.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/)\n* If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.\n* There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn't a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That's moat. Self-driving doesn't have moat.\n* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.\n* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.\n* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.",

        "selftext": "The IAA has been open for the last 4 days, but I hadn\u2019t been able to properly experience the MicroVision booth until now. I didn\u2019t want to distract Sumit Sharma, Dr. Luce, and the other 3 MVIS staff who attended from their B2B (business to business) goals. However, today was the first day that the general public were allowed to enter the conference halls, and Dave Allen from IR gave us the green light to go visit the booth.\n\nWhen I arrived at the booth with /u/MusicMaleficent5870, Sumit and Dr. Luce were nowhere in sight. We nevertheless decided to go in and speak to the MVIS staff. I personally spoke with Jonathan C (who I believe is the Director of Digital Engineering, thx Linkedin stalking). Jonathan walked me through the booth while MM5870 kept the other two MVIS staff members occupied. I introduced myself as a moderator of reddit and handed him my gag card..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ gag business card ](https://preview.redd.it/2zfx6lvzukm71.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8d919fd1ec5803c6f78d7c5c186b60c299b19b9)\n\n# Live Lidar Demo\n\nAn important note Jonathan mentioned was that two A-Samples were actively scanning the booth. One directly above the live demo screens (that sits on the *in*famous block of wood which I couldn\u2019t see even at a relative far distance), and one directly across from that in the back right hand corner.\n\nThe point of having two Lidars actively scanning is to showcase MicroVision\u2019s proprietary active scan lock architecture which allows the A-Sample to actively block out 99% of outside interference (as communicated to shareholders on multiple occasions in past earnings calls). As per past earnings calls the active scan lock architecture is based on proprietary technologies proven in their applications used in the Hololens 2.\n\nIn short, the Active Scan lock synchronizes the \u201csend\u201d and \u201creceiving\u201d side of the Gen 5 MEMS just as the Hololens 2 displays are sync\u2019d for the left and right eyes to prevent ocular discomfort (Sumit used a word I didn't recognize to describe that if the left eye and right eye images dont line up you get discomfort. I don\u2019t have education or background in this so could barely keep up). Each Lidar sensor is encoded its own laser signals and excludes interference even from similar identical units.\n\nFor example that if you were stuck in an intersection with 20 cars, each with their own set of short-range lidar (SRL), mid-range lidar (MRL), and long-range lidar (LRL). The IR light pollution and interference will overwhelm other sensors that do not have this feature that MicroVision owns IP for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ The second A-Sample live scanning acting as \\\\\"interference\\\\\" above the television which is showing the 1.8M Long Range Point Cloud. ](https://preview.redd.it/ien6mkf1vkm71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cb12842300f04b56ebe7c9fd7577c29351b7307)\n\nIt was explained to me that there is a filter on the live lidar demo. The filter removes the reflection of the floor for aesthetic reasons. They said that if they kept the floor in the final image, you would have been overwhelmed by extra data, but by removing them, the live stream data can be more easily interpreted. Additionally, there are indoor Class 1 EU regs that I believe are in play which made MVIS sandbag their sensor a bit (if anyone was noticing it isn\u2019t as sharp). Sumit says once all testing and certification is done there shouldn\u2019t be any issues seen specifically in the demo booth unit.\n\nThis is also a phenomenon you will notice in future Lidar demos, because the lidar sensor acts similar to the human eye does when it sees a mirage. There is a critical angle after which, the light seems to bounce to infinity. Therefore, the sensor will not return images of the road surface (due to it being a planar surface). All content which is 3 dimensional continues to be detected until the full range as advertised.\n\n# Elvis has Entered the Booth\n\nDuring the middle of conversation with Jonathan, I noticed Sumit and Dr Luce exiting from a meeting room behind the booth with an unidentified gentleman. They had obviously finished a meeting, and one of the helpers came out to return the A-Sample and the Gen 5 mems mirror back into the display (they were not there when we arrived).\n\nSumit walked over, I introduced myself as \u201cJay\u201d and he replied \u201cJay, nice to finally meet you, I\u2019ve been waiting for you all day!\u201d We arrived approximately 45 minutes before closing and I had been with Jonathan for approximately 15 minutes. Additionally, I had told Dave Allen I\u2019d try to swing by later in the afternoon, so I expect Sumit knew we were coming to visit eventually.\n\nSumit then whisked /u/MusicMaleficent5870 and I away toward the live lidar demo to start our proper tour.\n\n# The MicroVision A-Sample\n\nSumit asked us what our backgrounds were to get a grasp of our level of technical knowledge. Suffice it to say, we communicated that it was low lol. One of the biggest things Sumit wanted us to walk away with was the story he was trying to convey to investors. The specific story for investors to recognizing the true value of MicroVision\u2019s IP. The other story he\u2019s trying to convey is the inevitability for customers (from my interpretation of his explanation).\n\nTo give you an example, he spoke briefly about the Hololens 2 and Microsoft. Microsoft spent *years* trying to improve the display of the Hololens 2. It got to the point where they finally realized Microsoft could not achieve it alone (even with a group of ex-MVIS engineers on their engineer team \u2013 this is my addition for color). Alex Kipman himself mentions this in one of his talks in Zurich/digital streams in 2020. Microsoft eventually had to approach MicroVision to get the job done because of MicroVision\u2019s proprietary technology that they\u2019ve built in the past couple of decades. He also believes that **they would have never won that $22 Billion Dollar contract without them** (which I agree with. The Hololens 1 was head-to-head with Magic Leap which ate the dust after the Hololens 2 was released).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Microsoft's \\\\\"$22 Billion Dollar Contract\\\\\" ](https://preview.redd.it/5s1r48a5vkm71.jpg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdaec6c00acd3bc87406771b920045079ea5bb43)\n\nThis story of inevitability is what customers are starting to realize. If you want the best technology that solves your problems rather than creating further problems, you need to use MicroVision technology and IP (their family jewels). Their custom ASICs (which is available in a digital form) is one of the biggest advantages over competitors in the L2 and L2++ field like Tesla and Mobileye with their Camera only Neural Networks.\n\nSumit started to go down the rabbit hole into how Neural Networks work. He wouldn\u2019t trust the safety of that technology with his family, and that we wouldn\u2019t either if we read the disclaimers and fine print for cars who use these systems. This also aligns with Mobileye\u2019s current plan in developing a secondary independent Radar + Lidar system to ensure there are true redundant safety systems for maximum passenger safety.\n\nThere is a joke Sumit likes to share from the Silicon Valley Episode \u201cHot Dog, Not Hot Dog\u201d which helped us understand where he was coming from about Neural Networks.\n\n# The Family Jewels\n\nSumit believes that the ADAS market is going to go \u201cgangbusters\u201d sooner rather than later. See the bidding war currently happening between Magna and Qualcomm over Veoneer (who IAA placed side by side in the conference with Veoneer squished in the middle).\n\nMicroVision has a lot of key advantages with their proprietary custom ASICs. The way Sumit explained it to us was it comes down to basic math and physics. They can do things with edge computing faster and quicker than anyone else with their Family Jewels. **It comes from their custom OS that is built in their chips.** While Microvision is building their ADAS Lidar Sensors from an established foundation and decade\u2019s worth of tech and IP, their friends Luminar are spending billions just to be able to do the same thing with no guarantee that they can do it better or quicker than how MVIS is doing it.\n\nLastly, one of the key praises that potential customers have been commenting on the A-Sample is how **slim in profile the A-Sample is** (Apologies for the photo, I should probably take it lower down).\n\n[ Cassette of Truth - Kanye West's \\\\\"Yeezus\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/278gj577vkm71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54eaf8c77f33d8cd7b98b594a74dc47ce23bad25)\n\n[ MicroVision A-Sample ](https://preview.redd.it/trskb249vkm71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de0bfd1d8dacce0f34aada825dab45be30581c7f)\n\nI plan to publish an album of photos sometime this week which compares the other lidars on display with MVIS\u2019 A-Sample using the \u201ccassette of truth\u201d which I have been photographing to give an idea of the size of all the Lidar sensors. From my observation, MVIS is best in class from a profile aspect, all other lidar sensors are much taller in comparison.\n\n# The Lidar Product Suite\n\nSumit Sharma wants to generate more revenue. While the Hololens 2 currently does not produce enough volume for the time being,  **he believes that will change soon** with the new Lidar Product family.\n\nSumit also shared that they were getting a lot of requests for small NREs (non-recurring engineering) about, \u201chey we already have a product for short-range Lidar for the time being, can you make something for mid-range only, or maybe long-range only?\u201d.  There was enough interest that it made sense for MicroVision perspective to produce the A-Sample which would be identical to their Dynamic View Lidar (DVL) hardware wise, but with limited features the customer require now to help generate that revenue.\n\nTheir Dynamic View Lidar is meant to be their premium/flagship lidar offering. Sumit also touched on the use case of the 905nm lasers which have a standard and secure supply chain unlike the 1550nm lasers which are either custom made or non-standard supply chains utilizing exotic materials (which Velodyne does a great job of explaining in this article: [https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/](https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/)).\n\nNot only do the lasers help MVIS scale, but with the launch of MicroVision\u2019s fifth-generation MEMS to a 200-millimeter wafer silicon they control the whole process. They own their IP, and nobody else does. This gives them the ability to manufacture it the way they want. More control for MicroVision means more stability for customers.\n\n# True Value\n\nI was honestly surprised how in tune Sumit was to investors. He is also very aware of trader activity, but that is out of his hands. He\u2019s here to get true value for MVIS long investors and the multiplier/upside is massive in his eyes.\n\nI came away from the 30minute discussion in awe to be honest. There was so much content packed into that meeting, and Sumit was exuding nothing but confidence. If there are any German investors in Munich, make sure you go visit the booth, it\u2019s an excellent opportunity to share in the excitement and bullishness Sumit is currently feeling.\n\nGLTALs, it's 3:30am and i'm going to bed.\n\nTLDR - bullish",

Volume drops like a rock for the rest of the day and it sinks back down to $203.80 at close.\n\nAugust 27th: Jumps from $207 to $213 at open, volume goes down then back up over the course of the day and the price kinda waffles. This one doesn't follow the trend so well. The next day does, however\n\nAugust 30th: Jumps from $206 to $215 in the first hour on high volume (547k shares). Volume declines for the rest of the day and it drops again\n\nAugust 31st: Jumps about $6 in the first 2 hours on high volume (315k first hour, 729k second).\n\nSept 1st (Today): Jumps to hit its weekly peak of $231 at open on its **highest one-hour volume all week**, with 1.09M shares traded in the first hour. It then spends the rest of the day tanking on decreasing volume.\n\nIs it just me or does this seem incredibly bullish? It seems if we had a sustained high volume event we could see this stock rocket. Fortunately we probably do, as Sept 6-8th are the 3 days before earnings. Once this thing hits WSB and news outlets consistently we could easily be riding the rocket. Also because you're all brain damaged, this isn't financial advice.\n\n[crayon lines &amp; arrows for our special readers](https://preview.redd.it/9y9o5d5sgzk71.png?width=1913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7912e178518b335e0a07490fce23d79aaf7a63cf)\n\nAs a side note: comparing this to $AMC is pretty funny. It literally tanks on some of its recent volume spikes. Biggest P&amp;D of this week and stands no chance to keep going up.\n\nPositions: 3x $GME 10/15 690c @ 2.90(?) cost basis, probably buying one last one tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "Everything here is not financial advice. I just want to know if someone can do it better.\n\n**Prediction:**\n\nPersonally, I'm banking on a quick crash of 30%-40% of the overall market followed by a lengthy recovery time.\n\nWith the public consciousness being aware of the rapid inflation, the Great Resignation, the ending of the eviction moratorium, rising tensions within and out of the country, scrambled supply lines accompanied with mass shortages, and blah-blah-blah, I think a lot of investors have their fingers hovering over the sell button. This, along with the addition of short sellers ready to dogpile on the beginning of a downward trend, should result in a sharp decline in several securities' prices. However, unlike the Covid-19 crash, I do not believe we'll experience a quick bull rally after the market bottoms out.\n\nThe flash crash of 2020 was driven by the fear of an unknown virus and the suspicion of an overdue recession, but once heavy government intervention was in place, investors had their confidence restored. This time around, the U.S. is facing a likely default on it's debt and dealing with almost irreparable internal economic problems, and the general confidence in our institutions has greatly withered since then. I think America's government is very limited with how it can intervene and I have trouble seeing the market whales and many retail traders easily jumping right back in after any announcement has been made; leading to a prolonged stagnation.\n\nNow, I am certainly not a professional in market predictions or knowing what the hell the powers that be can do alter markets. I'm just someone who likes trading and has been keeping up with the news. You should take this prediction with a FISTFUL of salt.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nSadly, my broker restricts much of what I can do (no naked options, no covered puts, no margin account for options, etc.), which restricts how much I can grow my account. Nevertheless, I worked a way around these rules and plan for a FAT gain.\n\nWith that said, I want to combine my money with borrowed cash from friends/family (people who are outside the market) and a personal loan, plus whatever my brokerage will give me in my margin account. Estimated leverage should be roughly x3.5. After gathering the capital, I will short the ever-loving shit out of SPXL (a 3x leverage ETF of the SP500) and use the new founded cash along with some of the account's original capital to buy ATM puts. Next, using a majority of the remaining capital, I'll buy shares of SPXS (a 3x leverage inverse ETF of the SP500) and sell deep OTM calls because of the increased volatility due to panic selling. What's left of the account will be spent on ATM calls of SPXS.\n\nI chose SPXL and SPXS for the fact they follow the very stable and predictable SP500, but with more bang for their buck. I know WSB isn't known for it's safer gambles, but with the increased risk of using so much borrowed money and a falling market, I needed something to sound somewhat safe and reasonable to place the bet.\n\nIf this portion of the plan fails, all I have to simply do is consolidate all my debt and then become Wendy's personal bitch boy for the better portion of my life, reflecting on where I went wrong as I shovel grease into the mouths of meatbags. If this portion of the plan succeeds, then after paying back the principle and one to two month's worth of interest (how long I think the decline will last), I should obtain a return of at least x10.\n\n***NOTE:*** *i failed math class. number may vary.*\n\nNext up is the stagnation period of the crash. I will be taking some of the gains out of the brokerage account lock in my win. The rest will be scaled into discounted stocks (likely blue chips with decent dividend yields and leveraged ETFs). On top of scaling in, selling iron condors would also be considered. If it turns out that the economy will undergo another v-shaped recovery like last time, I'll kiss goodbye to most of my winnings, but still make it out with a profit.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nAnyone got a better alternative for taking advantage of the market crash without going full retard and yoloing your mortgage in deep OTM Tesla calls expiring in six minutes? Am I overlooking an opportunity or flaw in my plan? Did you even bother reading all of the post? Is everyone still holding onto GME?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI'm certainly not a doomer (or god forbid, a gay bear), but I do recognize crashes do happen and I just want to utilize extreme leverage to make a hefty gain after it's all said and done. But I do struggle to make five bucks on a ten thousand dollar account, so what the fuck do I know.",

        "selftext": "Pretty self explanatory. You may not believe things will go down, and if so it\u2019s not my intention to argue \u2014 I\u2019m familiar enough with investing to know value stocks will win if held in the long run and I understand we\u2019re in the greatest bill run in history BUT I can\u2019t help but see breaks in the dam. I\u2019m looking to make money when things go down. \n\nMostly concerned with:\n\n1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks \u2014 inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies \n2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we\u2019re at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won\u2019t be able to stay around without massive price increases \n3. Inflation isn\u2019t transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It\u2019s not just cars. Unless there\u2019s more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb \n4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating\n\nYou may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we\u2019re back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold \u2014 and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.\n\nIf you think this is possible, or heck even if you don\u2019t, humor me and let me know how you\u2019d invest. I\u2019ve got some shares of FAZ, SPXU, and UVIX because they seem to have blown up when interest rates racheted up in fall of 18 and I expect a similar performance when the fed realizes it can\u2019t print its way out of the PE bubble it\u2019s created. \n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "What's up retards, this week I may have found the best play I have EVER found to make you fucking RICH!\n\nDon\u2019t you HATE how your wife\u2019s boyfriend calls YOU a cuuck?\n\nWell... after SENS, you can fire him and become your OWN wife\u2019s boyfriend! Doesn\u2019t it sound nice to have her ALL to yourself?\n\nNow that I got your smooth-brained attention, let me explain why SENS is going to the FUCKING MOOON  \n\n\n**About the Company:**\n\nThis play is NOT based around the fundamental value of SENS, but it is important to know what the company is before investing\n\nSENS designs and manufactures Glucose monitoring systems. Their flagship device goes under the skin and transmits data to their app in real time! Their accuracy in real-time monitoring is revolutionary, especially considering that their newest transmitter lasts up to 180 days\n\nThey are currently awaiting FDA approval on the 180 day sensor, but have cleared most major regulatory hurdles\n\nKnowing that they are creating a good product clears some of the risk\n\nOK now that we got that boring shit out of the way, let me show you the REAL fun!  \n\n\n**Options Market:**\n\nSens has an INSANELY bullish options market with a put/call ratio of 0.2! This means that for every put, there are 5 MORE call options purchased!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2l7f1dhs5am71.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d48899e2ecf89dd2705d9996efc900c9e89f86a6\n\nEVEN including meme stocks, this is the HIGHEST P/C ratio I have EVER SEEN\n\nA high open interest and P/C ratio mean two things; the market thinks this stock will go up, and this has a potential for a gamma squeeze\n\nThe open interest on just 9/17 expiry is INSANE\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ui55d21u5am71.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=600508d2ac83260cfba660b4da4652452967eb0f\n\nThis means that ANY increase in IV or price of the underlying stock will lead to MM\u2019s purchasing a shit ton of shares to \u2018gamma hedge\u2019 to stay delta-neutral, which in turn will lead to a chain reaction of MM\u2019s buying shares to hedge which causes the price and IV to increase further\n\nEvery stock/option you buy will be multiplied by this effect, giving you a MUCH larger influence over the price of the stock\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nDespite making a good product and having an insanely bullish options market, shorts have over-shorted this stock up to 30% SI!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1setq0yv5am71.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=889840adc77bcbb2250f1dd1e7891f5c4372dbb8\n\nAdditionally, over the past few weeks about 45% of the daily volume has been sold short\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gmvqiqw5am71.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754d41ce9b3c815b5c9e52fb3c8a12a2d25ca1c3\n\nThese numbers alone don\u2019t necessarily mean shorts will cover their positions\u2026 But if you include the bullish options market, which is primed for a gamma squeeze, and a potential FDA approval, you begin to see why shorts are fucked and will begin to close their positions soon. All this stock needs is a catalyst...  \n\n\n**Possible Catalysts:**\n\nThe main catalyst I see for a short squeeze is full FDA approval on their 180 day sensor. Once it is approved, many shorts who were betting on the company going bankrupt will get out\n\nA few shorts covering mixed with such high open interest and new investors getting in will lead to a massive price spike and the potential to trigger margin calls on over-leveraged short positions\n\nThe more likely situation I see though is an immediate spike followed by slow exits from short positions. I don\u2019t see a massive M O A S S happening, but instead steady upwards momentum as shorts close their positions\n\nI see the 180 day sensor being approved within the next 1-2 months as their 90 day sensor has already been cleared awhile ago and their 180 day sensor has cleared most regulatory requirements already  \n\n\n**Positions:**\n\n10 $3.5 C 9/17, 10 $4 C 9/17, 20 $4.5 C 9/17, 20 $5 C 9/17, 10 $3.5 C 10/15, 8 $4 C 10/15, 20 $4.5 C 10/15 100 shares  \n\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0momzv06am71.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a19241f65d85abaee8926289751f41cef126725",

Obviously I was happy because I thought there was a chance of me finally not being a virgin anymore. But she didn't want to have sex with me.\n\nThan I though to myself: cool, maybe she wants to wait until were married. So skip forward a few years... And I proposed to here. I had small hope that proposing would be enough... but it wasn't. So marrying it is then.\n\nNope. Too bad. When we got married she still did not want to hit the schlong. I thought, okay than, maybe she just needs a little bit more time. So I waited.\n\nThan after a year or so we got kids. Two beautiful handsome boys. This is when I REALLY thought we would finally have sex. But still no action.\n\nSo now to the current time. Our kids are currently almost ready to get out of the house. Is that when she finally wants to have sex with me? I don't want to be a virgin anymore guys.\n\nDo you guys have any tips? Please help me out here.",

        "selftext": "Affirm reports earnings tonight and is expected to report USD 226m in revenue, which would be a decrease from their Q1 revenue of USD 231m. Guidance for Q3 is expected to hit 233m. I think the expectations are lowballed and Affirm will outdo them. The price has cooled down a bit since its recent jump, and this stock has already seen a lot of volume at higher prices than it is at today.\n\n**Increasing consumer adoption**\n\nWhen Afterpay started becoming successful, Affirm started attempts to move towards being a consumer company in a similar vein, which seems to be paying off now. Their app downloads this Quarter were the best they have ever been, and much higher than in the same quarter of last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6acfw397jhm71.png?width=1615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee1c355673cb256324d8a2ebd159b03fbf0a510e\n\n**Partners outdoing expectations**\n\nAffirm's biggest customer is Peloton who just had a mixed quarter. However hardware sales were still solid and I don't think the product recall will be taken up by too many people. Walmart and Target both just had big quarters, as well as the travel industry were travel bookings were up bigly in Q2 (although the outlook of those is a bit more mixed now with the Delta variant), Bestbuy, Figs, etc.. Referrals to Affirm's website from partners (what happens when you click on the \"Pay with Affirm\" button on e.g. Walmart's website) increased steadily since the beginning of this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf7lxywtkhm71.png?width=1349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c83faf99687fef4a1efc8b446181f461123a4fa\n\n**Industry trends in BNPL favoring Affirm**\n\nWith partnerships with Amazon and Shopify, Affirm is now a fixed player in ecommerce. Those companies prefer to keep the number of payment options low, so it is unlikely they will ever add more BNPL companies/loaners or replace Affirm. Affirm is now tied to 4 out of the Top 5 ecommerce companies and just launched a Canadian partnership with the 5th one (Apple). Affirm is probably the only pure play BNPL provider that can't be commoditized away. There will be some more consolidation to come for sure and I think these markets are pretty hot right now.\n\n**Positions**\n\nSince IV is quite high for my taste, I decided to go with a bull spread for this play. I'm pretty confident that numbers will be good and the stock price will at least be stable. I reach my maximum profit if Affirm is trading over 90 by expiry. Maximum profit and loss are both 24k. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulq92qy77im71.png?width=301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc3fe5c68aa32c1c7ee84ca049707382bd233a39",

        "selftext": "Here\u2019s my attempt at a DD into Rocketlab and why I\u2019m incredibly bullish on it. I\u2019m not a financial advisor. I\u2019m just a smooth brained ape that likes seeing flamey sticks go up high in the sky. \n\n\u2022 Rocketlab is literally the only main competitor to Elon\u2019s Space X, currently valued well over 15x RKLB\u2019s value.\n\u2022 They have over 100 successful launches of their 3D printed Electron rockets and will be launching from the US this year.\n\u2022 Currently developing their Neutron Rocket which will be very similar to the Falcon 9, given their track record I fully believe they\u2019ll have this is in operation by their target year of 2024. Of course, Space X is ahead of them in this regard, but there is room for competition in this sector. \n\u2022 Developing on-orbit refuelling, this is something Space X are also developing with Starship, Rocketlab want to do this with their Electron satellites, which are currently operational, so it\u2019s very possible they could do this before Space X.\n\u2022 Their CEO literally ate his hat in a promo video. He\u2019s New Zealand Elon Musk, what else is there to say?\n\u2022They already have contracts from NASA and the US Space Force.\n\u2022 Cathie is very likely to add RKLB to her Space ETF soon, which will increase the price.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible they could reach Space X levels of valuation in the next 5-10 years. That would represent a 1500% gain. \n\nAs the space industry grows, who knows how big they could get beyond that?",

        "selftext": "The world is producing roughly 125 million pounds from primary mining, 25 million pounds from secondary sources and consuming roughly 180 million pounds, for an overall deficit of 30 million pounds a year. This deficit will only increase in future years, as additional reactors come online. If you want to quibble with my numbers, quibble away. I know I\u2019m off by a few million pounds, but so is everyone else. No one really knows the true numbers\u2014which is what makes commodity markets so fascinating in the first place. All that matters is that there is a deficit, it\u2019s a big percentage of total production, new mines are not coming online at current prices and existing mines have had years of under-investment\u2014hence production should continue to trail off without new investment.\n\nHow large are the above-ground stockpiles? No one knows. All we know is that they\u2019re drawing down rapidly and outside of government entities, most of the stockpiles are spoken for by utilities, which are using their uranium to fabricate finished products for their reactors. However, a new class of investors has entered the market and they\u2019ve completely upended the equilibrium.\n\nRemember, GBTC?? I remember it quite fondly. What if I told you there\u2019s another entity doing the same thing in uranium, but it is cornering the free float at a rate that makes the boys at GBTC look like amateurs? What if the free float is organically shrinking due to the supply deficit? What will happen as institutional investors jam themselves into a far smaller market? Fukit, who cares? Someone intends to conduct this science experiment; consequences be damned. Importantly, this entity is using an At The Market offering (ATM). Hence, it immediately produces free trading shares; increasing trading volume far more rapidly than GBTC with its 6-month hold\u2014making acquisition by institutional investors possible and driving adoption. Basically, it\u2019s GBTC 2.0\u2014issue shares to buy product. Every day. Relentlessly. Except, against a smaller and shrinking asset class.\n\nUranium is different\u2014almost everyone who owns uranium today, owns it because they intend to consume it in their reactors\u2014these owners are all incremental buyers going forward. In a market with a deficit, they\u2019re all implicitly short uranium. With an entity buying up the free float, they\u2019re going to get squeezed. We all know how squeezes work, but I don\u2019t know of any similar scenario where the squeeze was as aggressive or blatant. The utilities are blissfully unaware, they\u2019re eventually going to panic and pay any price for uranium as a reactor that runs out of uranium is just an expensive paperweight.\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust commonly known as SPUT (SRUUF\u2013 Canada), is the entity that has upended the uranium market. **Since launching its ATM 13 days ago, it has acquired 2.7 million pounds of uranium**. This is an average daily rate in excess of 200,000 pounds or roughly a third of global production on an annual basis**. If GBTC is the roadmap to follow, as the price of uranium begins to appreciate, the inflows into the trust should accelerate. Interestingly, there are plenty of other entities also purchasing physical uranium, uranium that utilities were counting on for their future needs. The squeeze is on.**\n\nAs expected, the utilities are blissfully unaware. Surprised?? I\u2019m not. Utilities are quasi-governmental agencies, managed by the types of fukwits who\u2019d work at your local DMV, except they enjoy stock options. The fact that they\u2019ve ignored the coming squeeze shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Inevitably, they\u2019ll demand rate increases to buy back this uranium\u2013it\u2019s not their money anyway. This is your bid at some point in the future.\n\nCommodities are determined by supply and demand. Uranium is a small market at roughly $6.3 billion in annual consumption (180 million pounds at $35/lb). SPUT has raised approximately $85 million in the 13 days since the ATM went live. It\u2019s hoovering up supply and is already struggling to procure pounds, as shown by their increasing cash balance\u2014cash that they\u2019re legally forced to spend. \n\n**Something is going to give here, and I suspect it\u2019s the price of uranium.**\n\nIn any case, when I saw the rate at which SPUT was issuing shares, I legged into a rather large pile of SPUT. I\u2019m also long a few producers along with some juniors for extra kick. (Please don\u2019t ask me which\u2014if I wanted to name them, I would have). Uranium just broke out to 5-year highs. New highs bring in publicity, which often brings in new buyers and the cycle repeats. I like buying new highs from a big base\u2014especially with SPUT out there playing Pac-Man. I pulled back my exposure all summer as I was awaiting something interesting. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see anything better than uranium for a while. Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m suddenly back to being VERY fully invested.\n\nBy Tyler Durden - On zero hedge\n\nI'm IN. This could be massive.",

I was very confused about this. Why would she have a boyfriend? We are married after all?\n\nBut because I have so much faith in this community, I decided to ask my wife about it. It took me all the courage I had build up from the past 10 years. But I did it. Her response may not surprise many of you. \"Ofcourse I have a boyfriend\", she said. \"You really think I just don't have sex? Like at all?\". Obviously this shocked me. I've been a virgin my whole life. How uncommon is this? I was very confused.  \n\nSo obviously first thing I asked was what this guy's name was. \"Dan\", she said. \"Dan?\", I said. \"Are you kidding me? Both our kids are called Dan. Next thing you're going to tell me is I'm not the father of our kids?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We've never had sex\", she said. \"Ofcourse you're not\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell that just blew my mind guys.

        "selftext": "I have been trading SPY 0-1 DTE options in my Roth IRA. \n\nI trade daily expiring calls that usually cost about $1 per contract and have a 0.5 delta so a $1 SPY move is roughly a 50% gain (SPY only goes up, and I never bet against America since puts are anti American \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaa). It\u2019s well within my personal risk tolerance and honestly is a little bit too conservative for my liking, so I\u2019m hoping CBOE introduces hourly expiring options. \n\nWhile using some Michael Bury genius level thinking, I discovered a seemingly foolproof SPY trading strategy. \n\nI noticed that options do not go below $0.01. If I buy a bunch of SPY calls at $0.01, like 10,000 or 100,000, I can\u2019t sell them for less than the $0.01 and I only need it to go to $0.02 to double my money. Since SPY has amazing liquidity I\u2019m guessing the market makers will buy them back from me for $0.01 if it doesn\u2019t go up. If it somehow goes ITM and hits $1 I will make 100x my investment. It seems like free money, and honestly, I feel like I have no money at risk. I feel like it would be like an ultra high APR savings account. My bank account gives me 0.01% APR, this might get me 100-100,000% return which is way cooler. \n\nMy many dollars will soldier on and Tuesday will mark a great innovation to SirYoloGod\u2019s strategy which might make me 100x richer in one day without downside risk. \n\nI hope the great minds of WSB can guide me through this strategy.

        "selftext": "Once again GameStop ($GME) has proven time and time again that no matter how much it gets knocked down it just keeps getting back up for more gains.\n\nGameStop released its earnings this quarter and failed to provide outlook for investors and as a result the stock dipped more then 10.5% at the beginning of its trading session leaving it at $178 a share and by 2pm EST in a stunning recovery it was back up to $200 thanks to retail investors and the glorious apes and traders that follow it like The second coming of Jesus.\n\nGME was the single most popular ticker mention on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum, overtaking previous stars of the show Clover Health and SPY.\nAs of afternoon trading, more than 6 million shares of GameStop have changed hands, nearly doubling its 30-day average trading volume, according to FactSet.\n\nWhatever your take on the whole GameStop situation is one thing is for certain no matter what comes it\u2019s way redditors and traders alike will not let up on making GameStop one of the most profitable stocks to be apart of.",

        "selftext": "So old PLTR. Everyone loves them. The hype is grand. Actually they are not a bad early stage company. Growing revenues at a great rate with gross profits along side it. Most of their expenses after gross is selling/marketing expenses so like many software companies they will be able to reduce that expense a ton and therefore be high earnings growth a little down the road. Theres just one thing I can\u2019t get over and it breaks it for me...\n\nStock Based Compensation of 1.2B. Paying themselves 1.2B in stock when earnings are negative 1.1B. Thats a crazy disservice to shareholders. No wonder your PLTR shares won\u2019t go anywhere. For all you PLTR holders thats a major red flag and speaks to poor leadership. \n\nOnly posting this opinion because I never heard anyone talk about it amongst the hype...so there.",

        "selftext": "For a long time I have been seeing videos and posts all over the internet talking about wanting to start learning how to trade stocks and options as well as \"courses\" that will supposedly teach you how to become a profitable trader.\n\nMy question is why? There are multiple studies and books that show that trying to trade stocks and options is extremely unlikely to net you a positive ROI in the long run, things like transaction fees eat into your net gains just as one example. Am I mistaken in all this and day trading is actually much more profitable than just buy and hold with DCA? \n\nFrom what I understand you will not make money day trading as you are practically condemned by the laws of mathematics to break even or lose money in the long run. So what is so appealing about it? The only way I can understand it is if you are trading with a 500k+ account but even then why risk it? It is as if some people have forgotten or don't realize that the stock market is a place to store and compound wealth, not create it over night. Of the richest men on wall street none of them are so called \"traders\" (as far as I know). \n\nI understand there is always a very small minority who might be able to make meaningful gains in the long run but statistically speak that is not going to be you. Maybe I am just behind the curve and this is the new way to make money, but this is just the way I think of things.",

All 10 trades were winners. \n\nI'm at 25 winners / 1 losing trade out of the 26 combined. I'm currently at a 96% win rate according to tradersync. I think the nice part is that the equity curve is going up steadily.\n\nI don't put much emphasis on profits. Some are small, some are larger. I simply trade what I see and try to capture \"something\" in order to grow the account over the long haul. I plan to pull profits by year end and hope it's somewhere in the range of 15k - 18k. That's from starting initially with a $497 account in which I did add 2k to just about 2 days in to help speed things along, so in reality $2,500.\n\n(NET) Profits (after fees and commissions) so far on the account is $1,499.57 which translates to 60.04% just 12 trading days in.\n\nI'd like to say I want to keep this up, but am definitely **open to any additional advice from any other traders moving forward**. I play both CALLS and PUTS and don't prepare for any of my trades. It's a simple, wake up, open trading platform (thinkorswim), spot an opportunity at market open and trade it.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part 0: Intro\n\nSup freaks. Just came back from the moon and that shit is glorious. Here to officially introduce you to a play I\u2019ve been loading up on for weeks. The company is Genius Sports Limited, ticker $GENI, aka GENIE, or as Forrest Gump would say Jennaaaaay. You may be wondering why I\u2019m here? I\u2019m clearly (newly) rich, I should get a life. The answer is simple. I\u2019m a degenerate and it's short hunting season. Pow Pow. The FUD\u2019r of interest is forensic bitch and noted short seller Spruce Point Capital Management. These guys are incredibly ***unsuccessful*** in their calls so I take this as a major bull flag that they released a short report on GENI. Spruce\u2019s past successes include: MGNI (moon shot/money printer), DBX (DropBox), Nova (rose 88% after their post, talk about poor timing). These guys have the Midas Touch, ***anything their*** ***fungus filled fingernails*** ***stroke eventually end up moonshotting***; I\u2019m here to expedite the process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kw02izf6xbm71.gif\n\nAnyway, Genius Sports Limited (GENI) is a tech company that collects data from sports events, processes it, and sells it to major gambling companies to run their sportsbooks (SKLZ, DKNG, Fanduel, Caesars etc). They are the [pick &amp; shovel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pick-and-shovel-play.asp) play of a rapidly growing sports gambling segment ([gambling record $44bn in revenue 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/)). They have 4 competitors (large moat) but only Sportradar offers any real competition. GENI has deals with NASCAR, MLB, NBA, NCAA and the English Premier League amongst others. They are also the [official data partner of the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) holding exclusive rights; dump truck sized moat. Prominent investors include Cathie Wood, Mrs \u201cAverage Down at all Costs\u201d, Anpanaman \u201cGod Tier SPAC Wizard &amp; [wsb Yolo\u2019r](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/) (1.1m+ [\ud83d\ude33](https://emojipedia.org/flushed-face/))\u201d, amongst others (institutional ownership is 90%+). But, before we get into more specifics about the company + setup please watch this educational video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA)\n\nYup, I also love Christina Aguilera. So, gals put on your crop top and cargo pants, and fellas that backward fitted &amp; baggy jeans. Let\u2019s get groovy 90s style. Oh and Christina, please slide in my DM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bug2kfcaxbm71.gif\n\npls respond \n\n# Part 1: Fundamentals\n\nGENI is the backbone/infrastructure play on sports betting since they supply the  data that major gambling companies use.  GENI offers a suite of four products:\n\n* **GeniusLive**: this is a vertically integrated video service that allows teams or sports leagues to launch something like NBA League Pass. So the platform supports payments, live statistics, advertising, live streaming, and video on-demand, without having to buy a bunch of extra software/hardware. \n* **Sporttech:** Data capture, management and analysis tools that help leagues run their sport, unlock new revenue streams, and protect the integrity of their competitions. This is essentially the shit that has turned Facebook from some site used to scam on girls in  college into a company with revenues of over $10B a year. GENI collects all the data from degenerate bets, and provides the information gathered from them to their partners for future use. \n* **Sportsbook:** GENI provides the capability (but not requirement) to build out an entire sportsbook platform for their partners.  This provides all the benefits of having a sportsbook with none of the risk of spending capital on a field GENI partners are unfamiliar with.\n* **Media &amp; Engagement:**  GENI has the platform capabilities to allow their partners sports betting experience to enter into the world of social media.  You can chat in real time with other sports betters and complain that Nick Chubb stepped out at the 1 yard line and completely boned your 3 bet parlay. Through this platform GENI can leverage their fan engagement capabilities to drive advertising revenue and also promote future bets that may be to your liking based on your prior activity.\n\nAs  mentioned Genie\u2019s only real competition in this space is Sportradar, but Sportradar\u2019s [SPAC merger fell through](https://www.casino.org/news/sportradar-filed-for-a-highly-anticipated-ipo-on-tuesday/) after GENI swooped the exclusive rights to the NFL from under them -- ya know, the ole\u2019 Bulgarian ambush perfected by Vlad. \n\nThe NFL deal is pretty significant so let\u2019s dive into it: \n\n* **Expensive af**: Genius will [pay the NFL $120 million a year over six years](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/), with half paid in warrants making the [NFL own roughly 5% of GENI](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nfl-stake-genius-nearly-15-215504358.html). \n* **Locked in profit**:  Sportradar was pulling in 1.5% to 2% of in-play gross gaming revenue (GGR) on NFL wagers \\[[source](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/)\\].  Genius decided to go the opposite route by jacking up rates; asking for around 4% of operators\u2019 pre-match NFL betting revenues and 6% of in-play \\[[source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)\\]. Operators are big mad about this:\n\n&gt;*\"They don\u2019t really have anything new,\u201d said another operator exec. \u201cThey are charging 4x for the same dataset.\u201d*\n\nThese guys are forced to use Genie\u2019s official NFL Data either because they are official partners of the NFL (FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesar), state regulations require use of official data, or the TV networks force them to subscribe to Genie data to advertise.  As of now, [DraftKings has already partnered with GENI in a multi year deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/draftkings-partners-with-genius-sports-for-sports-betting.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1628161383), PointsBet, WynnBet, BetMGM, Caesars, and Fox Bet have also signed deals w/ Genius ([NFL names Fox Bet, PointsBet, BetMGM and WynnBet as Approved Sportsbook Operators](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/12973/nfl-names-fox-bet-pointsbet-betmgm-and-wynnbet-as-approved-sportsbook-operators)).  This leaves only Fanduel as yet to be disclosed, but likely already signed with Genie. Senior operator exec\u2019s legit crying that [its a monopoly.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)lol. Sucks for them, great for us.\n\n* **Sticky**: The Sportradar deal was inked in 2019 and they got cucked in 2021. Sad. GENI is proactively making moves to make the deal last longer than 6yrs by hiring a good amount of NFL vets. Including [Steve Bornstein](https://www.sportico.com/personalities/executives/2021/genius-sports-steve-bornstein-1234637226/), he now leads GENI\u2019s US business. Mans spent a decade at the NFL managing the media strategy, and spent multiple decades at ESPN and ABC.  He also was the CEO of ESPN for a cool min.   \n* **NFL shills for GENI**:  This cannot be reinforced enough: the NFL\u2019s chief concern is the integrity of the data provided, and they are entrusting GENI, and ONLY GENI, with that.  They will also force anyone who wants to do business with the NFL to adhere to the NFL\u2019s core integrity policies by [agreeing to license all Official League Data from GENI](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-announces-agreements-with-four-approved-sportsbook-operators)\n\nTo put this in simpler terms: the NFL is telling the world -if you want us, you\u2019re gettin\u2019 some GENI.   GENI also issued warrants to the NFL (5% stake in GENI)  meaning when GENI is successful the NFL is successful so they are locked in and incentivized to push GENI to anyone who wants to work with them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/l3e1xpncxbm71.gif\n\nThe reason I\u2019m bullish on Genie and jacked with shares/options other than the regular \u201c*it could squeeeeez*e\u201d play which I know, love, and bang the shit out of, and will explain this angle later, is because Genie secured the NFL deal at the perfect time. So, 3 yrs ago the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting. The NFL has responded by moving its business model towards generating significant amts of revenue through betting. Sucks for Sporttrader, since for most of the time they held the  exclusive rights to NFL data, the [NFL actually considered gambling to be threat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)**\ud83d\ude31**, what a bad position to be in going into the gambling golden age.  \n\nThe NFL expects to make $270m in revenue from sports-betting this yr, and  NFL execs are super bullish about their future sports betting revenue, here\u2019s a quote from one: *\u201c*You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade.*\u201d\\[*[*source*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)*\\]* \n\nThe ideal sports-gambling legislation, the NFL concluded, would include substantive licensing requirements creating clear and transparent markets that protect consumers. Bets needed to be resolved using the league\u2019s official data (GENI!! - fuck you, pay me.). There had to be prohibitions on betting by insiders and the onus placed on operators to make certain that wasn\u2019t occurring. \\[[source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)\\] \n\nSo, when I invest I try to think of analogies that speak to me. This lets me invest in a more  logical and clear headed way. I compare this situation to the girl that sat next to you pre-OnlyFans. She used to eat ramen for lunch. A couple years later she has a poodle, a G Wagon, and goes by \u201cCyrstal like the champagne\u201d instead of Bernice. Yah, she twerking on cam because she found a money printer, the NFL will twerk to online-betting.  Analogy.\n\nThe whole industry will be twerking. \n\nCathie Wood\u2019s a month before she started yolo\u2019n on Jenaaay estimated x10 increase in domestic sports betting handle (the amount of money wagered by bettors is called \u201chandle\u201d), to $180 billion by 2025 , with revenue\u2019s for the sector projected to sky at a 31% CAGR. \n\nOne reason for this bullish prediction is the New Jersey example; since NJ legalized online sports betting mid-2018, they've seen online handle moon to $15 billion, 1/2 of this took place in 2020. (*Don\u2019t know why people would yolo on sports and* [*not options*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/)*, but to each their own lulz*).\n\nSportsbetting is picking up so much steam, ESPN keeps their own tracker for up to date info on which states are going to let you yolo rent $ on Appalachian State vs Syracuse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g68ri70exbm71.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e3af4ca366eb8d64ba23ac0f970d51bdac69b8\n\nThere are only 3 states (Utah, Idaho, and Wisconsin - which btw if you live in any of these places - move the fuck out) that do not currently allow for sports betting and/or are in the process of allowing it.  Ground floor opportunity here.\n\n[Earlier this month, Wyoming Awarded Genius Sports Inaugural Sports Betting License - upping the number of states GENI can operate in to 15. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wyoming-awards-genius-sports-inaugural-213000130.html)\n\nSo clearly Jenaayy is a growth stock but let\u2019s look at the fundamentals &amp; also how Genie compares to the competition. (Genie, Jenaayy, GENI, Genius \u2026 lol sorry I\u2019m  dislexic). Ya so  Sportradar (Genie\u2019s rival)  is slated to go public this year and will likely trade in the $10-12B valuation range \\[[article/source](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2021/sportradar-ten-billion-valuation-1234623092/)\\].\n\nSportradar filed its S-1 a few weeks ago which provides historical financial performance.  Making some simple assumptions on continued revenue growth (based on historic CAGR) we can figure out Sportradar\u2019s valuation multiples which we\u2019ll compare to Jenaayyy\u2019s.  I\u2019m also throwing in Draftkings in the comparison as a high growth (but unprofitable), pure play sportsbook leader.  You can see below how the financials compare:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f6alqkfxbm71.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c25a5c75f0ca5b4498d9883053284138e273ec7\n\nI would argue Genie and Sportradar should trade at a premium to Draftkings as they have an effective duopoly on the sports betting data market.  Draftkings\u2019 sports book market is getting more competition from new players, which is causing customer acquisition costs to skyrocket.  HOWEVER, as more of these players enter the market, they\u2019ll have to buy all their official sports data from Jenaayy!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fk2cxfmgxbm71.gif\n\nLet\u2019s get serious for a sec,, below is a valuation comparison and as you can see Genie trades at a discount to DKNG and at a premium to Sportradar\u2019s expected IPO pricing valuation of $26-29 or $7.4B - $8.2B. It\u2019s expected that Sportradar will trade in the $10B - $12B range once it starts trading.  Genie should probs trade at a premium to Sportradar valuation given the enormous potential of its exclusive NFL deal over the coming years. Vauling Genie at a premium would imply a conservaitve estimate of $25 to $30 price per share based on the company\u2019s CURRENT projections..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f75x253ixbm71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a6d0efe77944fcd133102ba7e3424f6b93b026\n\nGenie reported Q2 earnings on 9/8 which beat estimates.  Revenue was $55.8M and EBITDA $5.2M vs. street estimates of revenue $53.8M and EBITDA $1.7M.  Genie tightened its FY2022E guidance to $250M-$260M of revenue (which was increased in Q1 from $190M) and EBITDA of $10M-$20M.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for i though, Wall Street analysts agree with their Price Targets:\n\n* Benchmark BUY $33 PT\n* Oppenheimer BUY $32 PT\n* Goldman Sachs BUY $31 PT\n* Craig Hallum BUY $30 PT\n* Needham BUY $28 PT\n* Singular Research BUY $28 PT\n\nThese 12-month price targets equate to an average $30.33 or 43 % upside from the current stock price.\n\nSome other data points:\n\n* Tute ownership 44.17%\n* GENI is in a $330M net cash position \n* Does it pay a dividend? Of course not\n* Free cash flow is absolutely atrocious - the company is in reinvest and GROWTH mode\n* Holy fuck is price to sales looks steep based on 2020A at 27.9x, but gets cut in half by 2022E at 12.3x due to massive growth\n* Positive seasonality outlook, very volatile but shows recently strong performance\n* Sales forecast looks great, with a forecasted growth of 126% from 2020 to 2022\n* First quarter group revenues of 52% year-over year\n* First quarter group adj. EBITDA up 414% to 9.3M\n* 6-year exclusive partnership with NFL\n* Has exclusive events with almost every professional sports agency, as well as tournaments\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74rp8m1jxbm71.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b50991702a45037e079fd174fc5bf6f870269c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hyzbzw4kxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 2: Institutional fuckery\n\nSpruce Point Capital Management [issued a hit piece](https://www.casino.org/news/genius-sports-stock-could-see-big-declines-says-noted-short-seller/) on Genie. Their primary claim is that Genius is a \u201cmiddleman\u201d with an \u201cinferior business model\u201d saying the stock could fall 60% to 80%, so a PT of $3.25 to $6.50. Well first off Spruce, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/uk0m1vhlxbm71.gif\n\nWith that being said, Spruce is clearly wrong. Given Spruce\u2019s history of abject failure I would go further and say this report is baseless FUD. So, why would Spruce put itself in the path of a runaway train like Jenaay? Seems crazy tbh. Welp they\u2019re known as a [\u201cSmash &amp; Grab\u201d short seller,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-jolts-activist-short-hedge-funds-into-adapt-or-die-mode) so these guys give friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public, profiting from the panic.  Spruce\u2019s hit piece was released Aug 5th, the stock rose the entire day and it\u2019s been in a legit uptrend since then, no panic lol. If this is Spruce\u2019y bois M.O. they just fukd their company and their friends with another horrible call. [It seems like Sprucey\u2019s gone into hiding, hoping this all blows over. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/enqy9vfmxbm71.gif\n\nNow it\u2019s Cathie Wood\u2019s turn to polish off Spruce\u2019s beautiful thighs. Cathie started loading the boat Aug 5, the same day of Spruce\u2019y bois FUD article, and the same day of the DKNG transformative day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkj42psoxbm71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04cf19309a136cec0b60564b0d881b2db1894769\n\nCan\u2019t help but respect Cathie\u2019s bullish buying. More importantly however, is this rising floor Cathie is building into the stock price. She is known for having strong convictions and sticking to them. She\u2019ll buy a dip &amp; take the ride. \n\n[But don\u2019t take my word for it. Check out this big, green, dildo. Cathie, you bad.](https://cathiesark.com/arkw/trends)\n\nIf you need any more proof, let\u2019s take a look at the near-100%-of-float institution rate. It\u2019s almost as if GENI has an unconscionably small float that\u2019s being aggressively bought by diamond handz Cathie while the MM buys remaining float shares to hedge calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qtw0aerxbm71.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b125abc619b0d2f3f96966ac63eff445603328cf\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ipnyrecsxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 3: Float and Lizard \n\nLizard theory has evolved since my [$NEGG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/) and SPuRT posts. Other redditors have come up with extensions of the general idea. I\u2019m going to do a breakdown of similar data from past analysis, including FTD rates and float comparisons, institutional ownership and recalculation of all this data (differs from online). \n\nAs of now, the outstanding shares listed on Yahoo and sites such as [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/geni/statistics/) is 191.51M shares. \\[However, the float varies, with Yahoo listing it as 63.36M and other sites listing it as 58.66M.\\] \n\n**The current float can be calculated as follows:**  \nSPAC IPO:    27.6M shares\n\nUnlocked PIPE:   33M shares\n\nFollow-On Offering:   22M shares\n\n**Total tradable float:**   **82.6M shares**\n\n**Lock up:**\n\nManagement (34.9M shares / 18% ownership) lockup expires on 11/17 and the SPAC Sponsor lockup (6.825M shares / 3.5% ownership) lockup expires on 10/17.  Apax, the private equity owner of Genius (60.2M shares / 30.9% ownership) lockup will expire on 10/17.  The gory details are all laid out here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img i8iutvjtxbm71...*\n\nThey also list the institutional ownership as around 44-45% but doing some calculations shows this is higher. \n\n**So is this an overcount or undercount? Lets see.** \n\n**Begin Math:** \n\nGiven **191.51M shares outstanding** as the general consensus across various financial sources, we can look into the overall preferred shares and institutional buyouts across several 13F filings and aggregated data on Fintel and StockAnalysis:\n\n**Top 3 Institutional Holdings:**\n\n1. Caledonia Investments - 16,305,582 shares\n2. Fred Alger Management - 15,046,102 shares\n3. Dmy Sponsor LLC - 6,825,000 shares\n\nThese top 3 holders combined have 38176684 shares or about 19.93% of the shares outstanding. \n\nThere are 137 other funds that also own shares directly, for a total of 63694543 shares or about another 33.26% of the shares outstanding. \n\nTherefore, institutional ownership alone is around (19.93% + 33.26%) or 53.19% of shares outstanding. \n\nNext we can take a look at the insider transactions. This has a general consensus of 19.25%, indicating that a total of 72.44% of the outstanding shares are owned currently. \n\nNow lets take a look at merger deals, ETFs and ownership through mutual funds. \n\nWe can see that the top holders for Q2 of 2021 in aggregate own 17,422,176 shares or about 9.10% of shares outstanding.  \\[source fintel\\]\n\n**Our total ownership of outstanding shares becomes 81.54%.** \n\nHowever, now we need to account for any institutions holding shares through these funds and for this reason some ETFs are excluded. Fred Alger Management has 15,046,102 shares of GENI yet through the ATFV Alger\u2019s ETF, they end up owning approximately\u2026 oh wait.. Lol\u2026 approximately an equivalent of 75 shares of GENI. Okay so looking at these ETFs looks like they have negligible impact on the float. \n\n**TLDR; The float for $GENI is about 35,352,746 shares or about 18.46% of outstanding shares.**  **With 4.14M** shares shorted this means that approximately **11.7% of the float is shorted.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvse6w5vxbm71.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab367a73760c2e67324adb2459b7797512f474f7\n\nFrom the FTD angle we see that nice giant spike with the price staying stable/bleeding up. This type of pattern I\u2019ve found to give more pop, and it\u2019s something I looked for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cudusyyvxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 4: Flow\n\n***Options Flow***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q9vahxuwxbm71...*\n\nOrder Sentiment: ***Bullish*** AF. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3brekt. 77% of options activity over the last 30 days has been ***bullish.*** 66% of money invested has been placed on ***bullish*** bets of the stock rising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bya2smuxxbm71.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21f20b87f47c05a5df9c39ede3b8005e30a33b2\n\nCall OI has been trending up over the last month, you can see an increase in OI for higher strikes as GENI\u2019s share price has increased 34.43% over the last month. The smart money has been betting on the price increase continuing. \n\nThe option chain: there are only monthly options, and the options chain itself is somewhat condensed to near the money strikes. This is all actually a good thing. It is forcing investors to streamline their investments into a more concentrated area, which has a greater overall impact on both hedging requirements and overall stock price. This is exactly how a MM or a shorty in duress would ***not*** want the options chain to look.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6d2c7huzxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 5: Positions &amp; Prayer\n\n20k shares\n\nx100 25c 1/21/2022\n\nx220 22.5c 10/15\n\nx200 30c 1/21/2022\n\nx220 22.5c 10/15\n\n# END:\n\nTLDR; High short interest.
