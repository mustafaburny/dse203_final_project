        "selftext": "**Vague Statements**\n\nSo many technical analysts talk like the Oracle at Delphi.  \"These are interesting levels to look at\" or \"This day/week/month is going to be really pivotal!\"\n\nUmm okay?  What in the fuck does that mean?  How does any of that possibly generate any trade-able insight?  Of course, it's not meant to, its purpose is to make the person sound like a wise timeless sage.  Oh how brilliant are the technical analysts that can easily discern \"interesting\" levels!\n\n**Weasel language**\n\nAnother favorite tool of technical analysts.  Saying what 'could' happen instead of what 'will' happen.  Write a long diatribe about how the current level **could** be either resistance **or** support.  Wait awhile until an up trend or down trend is clearly visible, then point to your useless piece of shit writing and say, \"you see?  What did I tell you!\"\n\n**Unfalsifiable claims**\n\nThis is a big one.  Any sleazy snake oil salesman worth his salt knows to make unfalsifiable claims.  Never ever talk about what **will** happen or even what is **probable**, but only what the **potential** is.  \"If things break down here, there is potential for further downside\" or \"Potentially, this could be massive support. Let's see what happens.\"\n\nOn the rare occasion where technical analysts go out on a limb, they always have an excuse at the ready, such as:\n\n* Technical analysis is about probability, nothing is 100%.\n* The pattern wasn't subsequently \"confirmed\".\n* There were unforseen factors.  Fuck you Fed! (When everyone and their grandma can see the continual Fed balance sheet expansion).\n* Hey man, you always have to set your stops.  \n* I was mistaken, it happens, but technical analysis works and look at all these (cherry picked) predictions that I (vaguely) got right!\n\n**Survivorship Bias**\n\nTechnical analysts **love** to bring up things that they got 'correct'.  \"Hey I told you that could be support and look at the rally since!\".  When someone is selectively bringing up their past record, they almost always leave out the ones they got dead wrong.  For example, every single month, post a quarter about how you're 'skeptical' of the market, that a collapse in equity prices is 'in the cards', and then after the 27th article, when there is finally a significant decline, make sure to bring up that article from now until kingdom fucking come.  Pin that article to the top of your twitter feed or link to it on reddit.  Doesn't matter if it took you 20 accounts to get a spectacular prediction right, people will follow a 2 week old account like lemmings.  \n\n**Analysis in Hindsight**\n\nThis by far, is imo the most annoying.  Many technical analysts, with the benefit of hindsight, like to opine about how past moves were oh so obvious well after the fact.  Whether this is done to intentionally mislead people or is the genuine expression of someone with delusional faith in magic lines can only be determined on a case by case basis, largely depending on whether or not they are selling a subscription service.  They will rarely, if ever, talk about how \"obvious\" a move **will** be but will drone on endlessly about how obvious **past** moves are.  \n\nI will say one thing about the fucking jackasses that post on loss threads with comments like \"duhhhhh you couldn't see the future!  How stupid!\": at least they are not sleazy scam artists.",

        "selftext": "Prediction:\n\nZM's increase in premium users will not be enough to offset surge in cloud costs from additional free users, among other things.\n\nCatering to free users who have little chance of being converted/upsold to the premium subscription comes with it's issues. This manifests itself in data usage. ZM will foot the bill for all of the free loaders.\n\nhttps://www.whistleout.com.au/Broadband/Guides/How-much-data-does-Zoom-use\n\nAlthough there was a partnership announced with Oracle, it seems AWS has been helping with the majority of the server demand, while ZM pays a premium for uptime.\n\nSo who is causing the data use to spike? Premium corporate users? I'd say only partially. The majority of the new users are casual users and schools. Id suggest reading this good analysis here (skip $WORK stuff):\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4346645-slack-on-zoom-out\n\nZM has stated that +90,000 schools are using the software which they provide for free with no cost, and no 40 minute limit (again large free user data consumption). That means there was 35 - 56ml FREE users per day from those sources. And as we know Zoom reported 300ml daily meeting participants instead of individual users.\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement\n\nSo as an individual user, if you were in x5 meetings in one day you account for x5 \"participations\". If you have a few classes a day as a student, it is likely that 30 - 50% of zooms daily uses was from schools who don't pay a cent.\n\nZoom has been extremely reluctant to release and clarifying data to show the number of paying customers they have. \n\nOf the remaining userbase, distinguishing how many free casual use vs paid use is difficulty. I'd wager that the vast majority are free users.\n\nAgain, is increase in premium users enough to offset:\n\n1) incredible surge in free users hogging bandwidth\n2) pay from the +$100M acquisition of Keybase\n3) increase in payroll from ZM announcing they are going to hire 300-500 US based engineers (which most likely them trying to erase the China image they have)\n4) higher allocation of profits to R&amp;D\n\n\nMy prediction is that the cost of revenue metric is going to increase dramatically from last quarter.\nhttps://last10k.com/sec-filings/zm\n\nI think the revenue and EPS beat slightly, but overall is a disappoinment. Earnings on 6/2\n\nI am holding 6/5 157.5p and 6/19 155p",

Here comes my next play with a bit more heads up, CLDR. Lets see if we can beat the previous gains.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Cloudera (CLDR) has earning coming up on 6/03 (After Market). CLDR is a cloud company benefiting even more from the current situation with customers including Intel, Dell and Sandisk.

It was the first company to develop and distribute Apache Hadoop-based software and still has the largest user base with most number of clients. In short, many different layers of cloud services all the way to AI.\n\n**Financials**\n\nShort Term and Long Term Liabilities - CLDR short term assets of $707M exceed both long and short term liabilities.

Remove as you please not posting again this is my final dd post on this company... use as you please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrevious  posts what I have been talking about is that I look for oversold stocks with major catalysts coming up near term. Verizon had exactly that Friday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 month VZ](https://preview.redd.it/ag21nod5yl151.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9e236a3bcb1426dbab4627720309205caa497f4)\n\nAs you can see Verizon has had a bearish trend after running up a bit after march. Being oversold for no reason when multiple catalysts are coming up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comparing with TMUS and T**\n\nT has been downgraded to hell recently and has no near term catalysts.\n\nTmus has not been upgrades at all and has some catalysts but the stock is not oversold so more risk to pullbacks.\n\nVerizon has recently reputable analyst upgrades \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Upgrades recently](https://preview.redd.it/bxisjvymyl151.png?width=1433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f010741e7df52d7f4ff3d0580e10302993fdc0)\n\nAlso another bullish sentiment is that hedge funds are increasing positions more than ever before in Verizon. \n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-verizon-175738734.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-verizon-175738734.html) \n\nAlways bullish to have smart and big money on your side autists. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Expansion of 5 compared to competitors.**\n\nAlready ruling out T as a competitor as we rule out their pretty shit. Real 2 are TMUS and VZ. Both can flourish as well keep that in mind. \n\nLots of articles on VZ main focus keeping 5G expansion as number one priority which should be. \n\n [https://www.barrons.com/articles/t-mobile-continues-to-outpace-at-t-verizon-now-the-focus-turns-to-sprint-and-5g-51588802443?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/t-mobile-continues-to-outpace-at-t-verizon-now-the-focus-turns-to-sprint-and-5g-51588802443?siteid=yhoof2) \n\nreal kicker now :) Tmus isn't as focused on 5G as Verizon hence why this opportunity is so bullish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLots of Cash per share\n\nMore cash per share than TMUS which allows for more heavy expansion. Also better profit margins allowing for more money to be made blah blah\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TECHNICAL TIME** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Techys ](https://preview.redd.it/jnalfscvzl151.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4691b1f300e990b8118e88d7c758d7370c3af4f6)\n\n1st thing to note is we see a VWAP and MACD crossover coming up. Not something to base a trade on but something to solidify your thesis and position. If I did DD yesterday would have went heavy today. You can see first support got CROSSED today. Meaning smart money and people know this is oversold. Wake up people! Oversold stock with major catalysts approaching with a strong balance sheet.\n\nTalking about finances... another bullish sentiment. Debt securities to be redeemed June 15th\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-redeem-debt-securities-june-062725915.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-redeem-debt-securities-june-062725915.html) \n\nFor you autists means of a way to pay off debt or interest on debt. \n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-5g-now-samsung-galaxy-163010245.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-5g-now-samsung-galaxy-163010245.html)  \\-exclusive to VERIZON\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DOWNFALLS**\n\nI don't see any downfalls unless market crashes. Does not look like it as unemployment is slowly decreasing. Also something for you autists to know. People LIQUIDATED their portfolio during March. People did not lose their portfolio value, they are loaded in cash. People will keep on entering out of FOMO and new variables. I do not see market crashing like that again... especially not till July 30th which gets into second leg of trade\n\n**Back to good and upsies**\n\nEarnings July 30th which means if trade fucks up because not everybody is right all the time nor an oracle... IV boost will be able to help you get out of the trade. Highly unlikely but always nice to buy time. If u enter buy AT LEAST TILL SEPTEMBER\n\nI only have January calls 57.5 and 60 as I sold everything else yesterday thinking VZ was moving on Spy, but today that changed as VZ kept keeping green even though market sell off at 3-4. \n\nWill be looking to add tmr at a decent entry price. Price entry is KEY. Will make a follow up post/post when I'm entering and what I'm buying because some of you autists need hand holding. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Am I retarded?**\n\nA little but your call\n\nMY REPUTATION: Have had some good and bad trades like all which I posted on WSB.\n\nGood: EROS (600% on merger) Abeo(100 percent on oversold due to corona) Selling TWLO puts( 100 percent because TWLO gapped 40 percent on earnings). TWTR earnings runup( sold before earnings at 100 percent gain). \n\nBAD: Selling Roku puts ( got out with 20 percent loss even though earnings were bad. If you play earnings always write the options. ZOM( but posted as a joke and sold my position right after taking the screen shot)- it was obv a joke but I will count it as an L. CPB CALLS( my thesis was wrong and I admit it was a bad trade. Hit my stop loss at 50 percent loss but know people who did not sell and now options are worthless... I'm sorry for that. I did not do enough DD and went in knowing low volume on options. Everyone makes mistakes in trading. Never a perfect game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Oversold stock with major catalysts. Both technicals and fundamentals look good to push share price of stock.** \n\n**57.5 and 60 jan calls. Will add tmr and post when I enter and which specific calls I'm buying for those that need to be spoon-fed.**",

        "selftext": "I am a web developer with cloud certifications in Google Cloud Platform and AWS. I have a long position in VMW.\n\n**TLDR: VMW June 19 150C**\n\nVMWare's earnings are May 28, which leaves some decent runway left to play the IV increase leading into earnings, but you don't want anything expiring too close to earnings, since theta will steal your premium. Expiring wwo weeks after earnings is usually a fine distance that protects gains, but you probably want to consider selling the day (or two) before earnings if we  had already run up to 150 quickly.\n\nSo, onto the actual DD. First, from a personal standpoint, as a cloud developer, there is no cloud without virtual machines, as they are an essential component to scalable architecture (and building your application to scale with user growth is basically the original point of cloud based technology). And without VMWare, the landscape of potential VM options significantly diminishes.\n\nIf the cloud is the gold mine, VMWare are selling the very best virtualized shovels. Shit, they can just spin up new shovels at a keystroke.\n\nVMWare is at the core of any sound cloud strategy, and Google has recently announced their fully-managed VMware Cloud Foundation stack on dedicated Google infrastructure:\n\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-announces-new-integrated-first-party-offering-with-vmware/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-announces-new-integrated-first-party-offering-with-vmware/)\n\nAlso, VMWare's relevance in the context of COVID-19, and partnerships with Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are highlighted in this recent Business Insider article, which is pay-to-read, so I've copied it here, since I'm no elitist:\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/vmwares-coo-the-indispensable-bridge-in-the-cloud-2020-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/vmwares-coo-the-indispensable-bridge-in-the-cloud-2020-5)\n\n&gt;VMware Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Poonen said the alliances it forged with cloud giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have transformed the company into an \"indispensable bridge.\" VMware's virtualization technology has become a critical tool in the cloud as businesses set up networks on multiple platforms and in their own data centers. \"If you look at the last two to three years, we're the only company where the six public-cloud-infrastructure leaders have all embraced VMware,\" Poonen told Business Insider. \"Nobody else has that position of being the indispensable bridge from the private cloud to the public cloud.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;The earnings reports from several tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google \u2014 are in, and they underscore a key trend: The cloud is hot.\n&gt;\n&gt;VMware Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Poonen, who has been keeping track of the reports, said he noted another common theme in these cloud giants' success.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"They've all embraced us,\" he told Business Insider last week. \"Some percentage of those companies' revenue growth will come from VMware helping customers.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;How did all the big cloud companies become VMware allies?\n&gt;\n&gt;The Dell Technologies subsidiary blazed the trail for virtualization, a technology that enables businesses to access disparate computer systems as one network. Virtualization has become even more critical in the cloud because it allows businesses to set up networks on web-based platforms and scale down \u2014 or even abandon \u2014 private data centers.\n&gt;\n&gt;A new trend called \"hybrid cloud,\" where businesses use multiple cloud platforms and in-house data centers, has made VMware even more popular, since its software makes it possible to manage data and applications across platforms. As a result, all the major cloud players (including China's Alibaba) have sought out an alliance with VMware.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"If you look at the last two to three years, we're the only company the six public-cloud-infrastructure leaders have all embraced,\" Poonen said. \"Nobody else has that position of being the indispensable bridge from the private cloud to the public cloud. We view Amazon, Azure, Google as our friends. We've worked really hard the last three years to build pristine partnerships with all of them.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Some of VMware's friendships have even risen eyebrows. The most prominent example is Oracle: The two companies had long been rivals, with Oracle refusing to support VMware's software for years \u2014 until it announced an unexpected new alliance last year. VMware Chief Information Officer Bask Iyer told Business Insider at the time that he was \"very pleasantly surprised\" by Oracle's decision to form a partnership.\n&gt;\n&gt;The COVID-19 crisis has led to a faster acceleration of the cloud as businesses scramble to adapt to the sudden pivot to remote work. VMware is well-positioned to benefit because of the alliances it forged in the past few years, according to Poonen: \"The notion of VMware being at the center of the cloud for the enterprise is only going to get more and more pronounced,\" he said.\n\n**TLDR: VMW June 19 150C**\n\nSecure those virtualized tendies.",

        "selftext": "I guarantee it. Went long 400 shares.\n\nWhy not buy calls like a true WSBer? We can't, yet. \n\n\"The closing price of the company's shares in the market must have a minimum per-share price for a majority of trading days during the three prior calendar months. The current minimum price is **$3.00 per share** for \"covered securities\" or $7.50 per share for non-covered securities.\" - CBOE rules\n\nIn case you missed it, NNDM just accomplished a **world-first** in Additive Manufacturing, or \"3D printing\", specifically for high performance and military grade electronics. We're talking about 3D printing thick and durable microchips, with electronics soldered to both sides, meeting the specs for military and ISS use. This has never been done before in history, and the Intellectual Property value here is extraordinary.\n\nhttps://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/hensoldt-and-nano-dimension-achieve-breakthrough-in-electronics-3d-printing\n\n*NNDM owns the patent to both types of \"inks\" used to manufacture this process.* Inks are the material the printer jets out and layers to 3D print an object. 3D printing military-grade, double-sided microchips is especially hard, and this company is now proven to be the best and only in the world.\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/25/1741237/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Receives-Patent-Approval-from-both-the-U-S-and-Korea-Patents-and-Trademark-Offices-for-Innovative-Dielectric-Ink.html\n\nThis accomplishment means NNDM has successfully condensed the laborious production process of the highest performance computer chips in the world into a singular 3D printing unit, the DRAGONFLY LDM, with its **patented inks**: AgCite Nanoparticle Silver Ink\nDielectric Nanoparticle Polymer Ink, being the keys to unlocking this process.\n\nThis news broke Tuesday 5/19. Share price promptly jumps to close at $3.40, (reached $6 AH) after sitting at ~$0.70 for months. NNDM announces 18M direct offering at $2 per share the next day which will only increase outstanding shares from 27M to 25M. These shares hit market tomorrow, but the news is priced in already: closed today at $3.09. Intense volume the last few days, and MM's are now making sure this ticker will be optionable ASAP.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/nano-dimension-prices-35-9-124241223.html\n\nIMO this is a prime buy and solid company: true blue-chip in the making, or a strong buyout target. Their CTO has a remarkable track record as well, and this IP is a game-changer. Once this stock becomes optionable, I'm sure you can imagine the tendies. For now, go long and make THETA work for you. Good luck every gang.\n\nnote on the chart - 1:10 Reverse split in 10/2019. Listed on NASDAQ in 2016, I believe at what would have been $8 at the time. This was indeed a tech penny stock a few weeks ago, trading at $0.07 relative to 2016 (300M initial offering). The true value of its IP has not been realized until the PR 2 days ago. Now, you can buy at the new bedrock: $3.00. Welcome everyone!\n\nPS: if this works out all I'd ask for is a sweet Nano Dimensional Oracle flair.",

        "selftext": "Interesting analysis by Andrew Ross Sorkin in The New York Times today. \n\nSome might think this is obvious but most are just talking about airlines. Perhaps he is signaling some real concern but is trying not to spook the markets and be positive.\n\n[Article - No Paywall - Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-warren-buffett-is-optimistic-pessimistic-no-realistic/)\n\nExcerpt:\n\n&gt;Every year for the last decade, I\u2019ve sat  onstage at this meeting in Omaha with Mr. Buffett and his best friend,  Charlie Munger, as one of several journalists asking him questions sent  in by the public. His positivity, even during difficult economic  moments, always radiated with a clear sense of certainty. After all, he  is known as the Oracle of Omaha.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That\u2019s why it was unsettling to hear him  repeatedly say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He was careful to say the markets would  improve in the long term \u2014 though his time frame for certainty was  decades, not months or not even necessarily years from now. About the  current climate, he said, \u201cYou can bet on America, but you kind of have  to be careful about how you bet.\u201d He added \u201csimply because markets can  do anything.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At a time when the stock market has been  buoyed by politicians pushing to reopen America and hopeful investors  often willing to overlook the immediate economic carnage, Mr. Buffett  sounded a note of realism about the challenges ahead.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He talked about the possibility of a  second wave of coronavirus infections. He acknowledged that the world  might profoundly change for years to come. And he spent a notable  portion of the meeting detailing the economy\u2019s performance since 1789,  with a particular focus on the years between 1929 and 1951, a period in  which the stock market took 22 years to get back to its highs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;More than his words, he spoke with his  wallet. He usually relishes a down stock market to take advantage of  lower prices. Not this time. He hadn\u2019t made any purchases recently; he  didn\u2019t buy up stocks when they had fallen last month during what felt  like a mini-panic: \u201cWe have not done anything, because we don\u2019t see  anything that attractive to do.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Juxtapose that with his actions in the midst of the financial crisis of 2008. Back then, he wrote an [op-ed in The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html)  a month after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy: \u201cIn the near term,  unemployment will rise, business activity will falter and headlines will  continue to be scary. So \u2026 I\u2019ve been buying American stocks.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This time, he is husbanding his capital. \u201cOur position will be to stay a Fort Knox,\u201d he said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In other words, he is hoping to protect the company if things get worse, and he is clearly worried enough that it might.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He said the $137 billion he had on hand \u201cisn\u2019t all that huge when you think about worst-case possibilities.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let that seep in.",

        "selftext": "This is my first post so give me some slack - probably room for improvement...\n\n**INTRO**\n\n[DXC Technology](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DXC?p=DXC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) is an IT services company that also has branches in cloud computing (hyped up atm), consultancy and analytics services and operates in pretty much any industry you can think of. This gives them diversity and allows them to have clientele even in a pandemic, most notably with their healthcare, public sector and banking solutions. As I'm writing this I believe that their assets make them somewhat undervalued at $14, and as they have earnings 05/28 there may be room for a run up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VALUE**\n\nAccording to their website they maintain 100 million health records, provide services for 15,000 healthcare and life sciences professionals and have over 1 million users of their software and systems products. Primarily they appear to provide administration products to healthcare providers and use Microsoft cloud to implement some of their products. More importantly they aim to reduce time-to-market and accelerate drug development, one of the main challenges facing COViD-19 drug manufacturers.\n\nIn their public sector business, they provide a management service to companies for AWS, Azure, VMware, Oracle and Google cloud platforms to  \"enable companies to focus on their strategic priorities while shifting the burden and expense of building and managing an hybrid cloud infrastructure\". Their website also shows:\n\n* 800+ managed cloud customers\n* Experts in complex, enterprise-scale transformation\n* 20,000+ Microsoft professionals/Microsoft Certified Solution Provider\n* 1,000+ AWS professionals/AWS Premier Consulting Partner\n* Managed services for Azure, AWS, VMware, Oracle, Google &amp; more\n* Full-stack Platform as a Service for SAP\n\nIn terms of their banking subset, they operate in over 70 countries, have processed in excess of 80 million payment accounts and service 250 million mortgages. They also provide security and analytics using AI and automation, for example helping NatWest, a major RBS group UK bank, move to image-based cheque-clearing.\n\nThese are a few examples of some of their operating industries but if you want to see more visit the website, I'm not doing all the work for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Partners**\n\nThis is just a short section but they have over 200+ partners, showing potential for a wide customer base, a few are:\n\n* AT&amp;T (cloud services)\n* AWS\n* Google Cloud\n* Microsoft\n* HP\n* Dell\n* IBM\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nNow this is where it gets a bit tricky. All credit to u/fuzzyblankeet and Co. but no matter how many times I've smashed my head into their financials I still struggle to understand them. I'm gonna need some help with this bit from you guys in the comments.\n\n|Fiscal Quarter|Date reported|EPS forecast|EPS actual|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2019|02/06/2020|1.08|1.25|\n|Q3 2019|11/11/2019|1.44|1.38|\n|Q2 2019|08/08/2019|1.71|1.74|\n|Q1 2019|05/23/2019|2.07|2.19|\n\n\\*^(According to Nasdaq.com)\n\nI don't know why EPS seems to decrease every quarter despite them having what I consider to be a strong business model, however I will link their financials [here](https://www.dxc.technology/investor_relations/ds/140309-dxc_financial_reports) if the more experienced among you want to give feedback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI just wanted your opinion on whether this is a good trade for earnings next week as I'm looking for something to replace VTIQ as a money maker, I want them to go up more but need something less volatile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: If you're coming to me for financial advice there's no hope.**\n\nAlso was looking at [Marvell Technology](https://www.marvell.com/) as they seem to be making moves in 5G and cloud computing, so feel free to feedback on that if you want to have a look.

        "selftext": "Last week was mixed with positive and negative drivers for the market, but it closed with a devastating statement by Warren Buffett that will likely drag down next week's markets: \"The world has changed...and I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way\".\n\nHere are the details:\n\nBetter than expected earnings reports from tech and airline companies. This week began with strong earnings reports by Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), United Airlines (UAL), and others, demonstrating that analyst expectations for COVID-19's impact on the markets were overstated. Markets rallied on these strong earnings reports.\n\nGilead (GILD) announced a successful COVID-19 treatment and is making it widely available for free. Mid-week, GILD announced a successful phase 3 trial for remdesivir for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir's ability to reduce hospital stays to &lt;2 weeks for over 50% of patients. The drug gained FDA approval for emergency use and will be available to COVID-19 patients for free beginning next week. This event was another positive driver in the markets last week. \n\nAmazon (AMZN) profits dip due to coronavirus response, even though revenue grew by 27% since last year, disappointing investors. AMZN share price decreased by \\~8% from the beginning of the weak as it posted earnings 20% lower than analyst expectations. Bezos told investors that the increase in expenses were from spending millions on developing COVID-19 tests to test all its employees and implementing enhanced cleaning techniques to prevent COVID-19 spread.\n\nWarren Buffett sells all airline shares as he is uncertain what society will be like coming out of COVID-19. Warren Buffett announced he sold all his airline shares because he is uncertain about society after the COVID-19 crisis. Buffett stated with uncertainty, \u201cThe world has changed for the airlines. And I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way. I don\u2019t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.\u201d This announcement may have a rippling effect on the market as many investors deem Buffett as an \"oracle,\" able to see the future of markets.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m optimistic about the economic recovery once stay-at-home declarations have been lifted. Protests across the country indicate unrest that is associated with lack of employment and the inability to move freely. Gilead's remdesivir brings a sense of security to economic opening as it may save many at-risk, severe patients from death. The virus is a transient event that will leave as quickly as it came.",

It took off with the iPod in 2001 and really made its mark with the first iPhone in 2007. The price has fallen with the recent market disruptions. It\u2019s still down from its recent peak of $325 to $300 now.\n\nWith Apple stock making investors happy for over a decade, this might be a compelling price for them to make new investments. The PE ratio is actually right now somewhat above the median for real economy stocks, but that\u2019s low for a tech company that is still generally in expansion mode, and especially low for a tech company with such brand recognition.\n\n**DAL (PE: 4x)**\n\nInvest at your own risk.\n\nDelta Airlines was showing healthy profitability since 2016 until the quarter ended in March. 2016 was the same year that famed value investor Warren Buffett, who once famously eschewed all airline stocks, started to pick up Delta shares himself. Before the coronavirus, people were more confident about their economic situation and travelling more in a growing economy. However, the coronavirus changed all that.\u00a0Delta swung to a loss in the first quarter, and the second quarter will likely be worse. Warren Buffet sold all his airline shares in April.\n\nFor these reasons, the PE ratio is so low at 4x (a trailing figure based based on 2019 earnings).\n\nTo support employment in the industry, the US Treasury department allotted billions of dollars to airlines, including about $5 billion for Delta.\n\n**ORCL (PE: 16x)**\n\nOracle is a tech stock that has a very low P/E ratio. Stock price performance has been consistent since the 2001 recession. Oracle is benefitting from the transition to cloud computing and is likely a fairly safe buy for the long term.\n\n**RHI (12x)**\n\nRobert Half provides staffing and risk consulting services in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. An economic downturn will reduce hiring and thus demand for Robert Half\u2019s staffing services. But if you have a long-term horizon you may want to take a second look.\n\n**HD (22x)**\n\nHome Depot is often used as a case study for great financial management of a company. It was showing consistent strong earnings performance.\n\nBut after the recent market crash, the stock was down big. It is back with a vengeance though; It is up 50% in price from its low in March, and 10% since [we highlighted the stock on our Instagram page on April 20th](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NaV-SHB_-/).\n\nDisclaimer: I hold HD, ORCL and AAPL.\n\n The *Price Earnings Ratio Stock Value Tracker* gives real-time PE ratios for 18 of the most important publicly traded stocks in the United States including Apple and Home Depot, with an easy-to-use dashboard that shows you were the value is.

The forecasts differ slightly, [but the market value will increase dramatically in the future](https://theeuropeanview.com/best-winner-stocks-for-cloud-computing/#Market_Value). \n\nSo my question is, how do you invest in such a growing future market? My problem is that cloud computing is not just cloud computing, but there are many different service models (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and more). Besides, there are companies where cloud computing is only a business unit, among others (Microsoft; Amazon; Tencent; IBM) and other companies that mainly do cloud computing (Oracle; Shopify; Salesforce). \n\nThat is why I conducted a fundamental analysis ( [(click here if you want)](https://theeuropeanview.com/best-winner-stocks-for-cloud-computing/#more-2153) ) of the market and examined the individual players according to their multiples. All in all, I think SAP and Salesforce are very attractive investments according to value criteria.",

This week began with strong earnings reports by Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), United Airlines (UAL), and others, demonstrating that analyst expectations for COVID-19's impact on the markets were overstated. Markets rallied on these strong earnings reports.\n\nGilead (GILD) announced a successful COVID-19 treatment and is making it widely available for free. Mid-week, GILD announced a successful phase 3 trial for remdesivir for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir's ability to reduce hospital stays to &lt;2 weeks for over 50% of patients. The drug gained FDA approval for emergency use and will be available to COVID-19 patients for free beginning next week. This event was another positive driver in the markets last week. \n\nAmazon (AMZN) profits dip due to coronavirus response, even though revenue grew by 27% since last year, disappointing investors. AMZN share price decreased by \\~8% from the beginning of the weak as it posted earnings 20% lower than analyst expectations.

Warren Buffett announced he sold all his airline shares because he is uncertain about society after the COVID-19 crisis. Buffett stated with uncertainty, \u201cThe world has changed for the airlines.

I don\u2019t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.\u201d This announcement may have a rippling effect on the market as many investors deem Buffett as an \"oracle,\" able to see the future of markets.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m optimistic about the economic recovery once stay-at-home declarations have been lifted. Protests across the country indicate unrest that is associated with lack of employment and the inability to move freely.

It\u2019s still down from its recent peak of $325 to $300 now.\n\nWith Apple stock making investors happy for over a decade, this might be a compelling price for them to make new investments. The PE ratio is actually right now somewhat above the median for real economy stocks, but that\u2019s low for a tech company that is still generally in expansion mode, and especially low for a tech company with such brand recognition.\n\n**DAL (PE: 4x)**\n\nInvest at your own risk.\n\nDelta Airlines was showing healthy profitability since 2016 until the quarter ended in March. 2016 was the same year that famed value investor Warren Buffett, who once famously eschewed all airline stocks, started to pick up Delta shares himself. Before the coronavirus, people were more confident about their economic situation and travelling more in a growing economy. However, the coronavirus changed all that. Delta swung to a loss in the first quarter, and the second quarter will likely be worse. Warren Buffet sold all his airline shares in April.\n\nFor these reasons, the PE ratio is so low at 4x (a trailing figure based based on 2019 earnings).\n\nTo support employment in the industry, the US Treasury department allotted billions of dollars to airlines, including about $5 billion for Delta.\n\n**ORCL (PE: 16x)**\n\nOracle is a tech stock that has a very low P/E ratio. Stock price performance has been consistent since the 2001 recession. Oracle is benefitting from the transition to cloud computing and is likely a fairly safe buy for the long term.\n\n**RHI (12x)**\n\nRobert Half provides staffing and risk consulting services in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. An economic downturn will reduce hiring and thus demand for Robert Half\u2019s staffing services. But if you have a long-term horizon you may want to take a second look.\n\n**HD (22x)**\n\nHome Depot is often used as a case study for great financial management of a company. It was showing consistent strong earnings performance.\n\nBut after the recent market crash, the stock was down big. It is back with a vengeance though; It is up 50% in price from its low in March, and 10% since [we highlighted the stock on our Instagram page on April 20th](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NaV-SHB_-/).\n\nDisclaimer: I hold HD, ORCL and AAPL.\n\nThe *Price Earnings Ratio Stock Value Tracker* gives real-time PE ratios for 18 of the most important publicly traded stocks in the United States including Apple and Home Depot, with an easy-to-use dashboard that shows you were the value is.

        "selftext": " \n\nWarren Buffet is considered to be the fountain of wisdom when it comes to investing. He is called the oracle of omaha. So, here is a nugget o wisdom that I got from one of Warren Buffet's videos. The link to the video is in here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbjPiYE-F4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbjPiYE-F4Y)\n\nIn this video, Buffet talks about diversification. It has been commonly said that diversification is the only free lunch in the stock market. Or, there is also the famous saying, don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nHowever, Buffet considers diversification to be a mistake. What???\n\nHe says that a person who wants to evaluate businesses should own only 6 stocks.\n\nLater on, Buffet talks about taking advantage of your investment in a big way and not going small.\n\nHe then talks about this idea of having a punch card with 20 punches on it. If each time you make an investment decision, you used up one of the punches, you would make each decision very carefully. And not only that, it is implied here that once you decide to do it, you will go big because you only have 20 shots for your whole life.\n\nThis idea is so profound that it may very well change your life and make you rich.\n\nFor the longest time, I had no understanding of what Buffet was talking about here. I kind of get the concept, but I still could not understand it.\n\nI used to think that what he meant was if you had a portfolio of stocks, you would allocate 20 spots for investments, and for each one, you would consider carefully. This way, you would build a solid portfolio of up to 20 stocks that you researched thoroughly. Then, you invest a good amount in each one and then hold on forever.\n\nIn essence, that is what Berkshire Hathaway, Buffet's company, does.\n\nBut, oh no, the oracle don't come cheap. There is much greater and more powerful wisdom in this idea.\n\nSee, if you had some money to invest, some disposable income, and you thought long and hard about how to invest it. You waited for a long time for a good idea to present itself. Then, once the idea appears, you continued to be patient and waited for the price to drop due to some external factors such as a global pandemic. And all that time, you thought this through and made sure that if you are going to put your hard earned money into this investment, you had satisfied yourself that this is a very safe investment, first and foremost, and then that its growth prospects are also quite certain.\n\nThere are no guarantees in life, but there can be certain situations where you can be quite sure about something.\n\nNow, let's say that you reckon that this investment can return multiple times and is quite safe. You see a good low entry price, and you are ready to hold it for the long term come hell or high water.\n\nSo, now you make the plunge and go for it. This is your first punch on the punch card.\n\nIf you did your thinking right, there is a good chance that this investment does, in fact, return multiple times over the course of a few years. Of course, how many times and how long it takes, no one knows.\n\nFor the sake of this discussion, let's say you held for 5 years and it went up 10 times. This is not all that out of the question.\n\nNow, that is one great investment. And after you put your money in, you did not have to do a single thing for 5 years. At the end of the 5 years, you had 10 times what you invested.\n\nNow, here is the big key to the oracle's wisdom. Since you had nothing to do for 5 years, how about you spend those 5 years thinking about another great investment?\n\nSo, once again, you thought and thought about it. You finally found a good one. You waited and waited for a good entry price. All that time, your first investment is going up like a snail on your wall after a rainy day.\n\nNow, you are ready for your second investment. Conventional wisdom would say to take some of your first investment's gains and put it into your second investment. In doing so, you have diversified.\n\nHowever, that is not a punch worthy of the punch card. We only have 20 punches. We cannot be diversifying here; especially, after 5 good years of careful thinking.\n\nNo, the oracle's wisdoms says that at this point, you should have full confidence in your thinking, and roll almost all of the first investment into the second investment.\n\nLet's say you decide to take that plunge and put all you can from the first investment into the second investment. This would be your second punch on the punch card.\n\nNow, as the amount of money we are talking about is now much higher, your second investment is safer and will go up a bit slower.  It would be like waiting for a dead rat to crawl across your lawn. What???\n\nSo, let's say, this second investment goes up only 9 times over 6 years.\n\nBut, if you had put in all you can from the first investment, this would compute to a 90 times multiple on your original investment. And, it took 11 years.\n\nYou get the idea now?\n\nSay, you did this again for a third time. This time rolling all you can and being a bit safer. You are now waiting for a hot chick to call you back. What???\n\nPatience, my dear, patience.\n\nSo, investment number three returns 8 times over 7 years.\n\nYou are now at 10 x 9 x 8 = 720 times return on your original investment over 18 years.\n\nRing! Hot chix calling!!!\n\n18 years for 720 times. If you have a baby and want to set up a college fund for that kid, here is how to do it. And, you don't even have to start with that much money.\n\nLet us say that you did this over and over throughout your whole life. Each time, you go safer, but each time you go for all you can.\n\nAfter 9 cycles, you would achieve a return of 10!, 10 factorial:\n\n10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 = 3,628,800 times\n\nHoly cow!!!\n\nEstimated time frame of: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 81 years\n\nNow, 81 years might not be realistic for most of us. But, also, it may not take 13 years for something to return 2 times. That's a bit of a stretch. So, let me adjust for more realistic numbers and say every investment takes about 7 years.\n\nThat would be:\n\n7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 63\n\nNow, that's a bit more realistic for the average person. Remember, this is something you can do when you are 100 years old, that is doing nothing except waiting for an idea or for an investment to go up.\n\nSee, with this method, even starting with $1,000 would make a person a billionaire. Yes, billionaire. We are not talking millions. No, no, we are thinking oracle of omaha money. Billions. 3 commas.\n\nImagine risking an original investment of $1,000 to make billions?\n\nFor most people, they can go even bigger. Let's say a person saved for a year and started this plan at $10,000. We are now talking billlions even sooner!!!\n\nFurthermore, with this plan you only need that original one year savings of $10,000. After this, you can go put your other money in other things such as paying off that mortgage and food. You can just live your life. Pursure your dreams. Continue to drive for Uber and wonder if it's worth it.\n\nThis plan is designed to help people who just live normal lives. You see, with the oracle's wisdom just about anyone can become rich. Not only rich, 3 commas rich.\n\nTake some time to think about this carefully. It may be the greatest idea you have ever heard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started an investment club on Discord.

        "selftext": "This is my first post so give me some slack - I might be missing something...\n\n**INTRO**\n\n[DXC Technology](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DXC?p=DXC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) is an IT services company that also has branches in cloud computing (hyped up atm), consultancy and analytics services and operates in pretty much any industry you can think of. This gives them diversity and allows them to have clientele even in a pandemic, most notably with their healthcare, public sector and banking solutions. As I'm writing this I believe that their assets make them somewhat undervalued at $14, and as they have earnings 05/28 there may be room for a run up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VALUE**\n\nAccording to their website they maintain 100 million health records, provide services for 15,000 healthcare and life sciences professionals and have over 1 million users of their software and systems products. Primarily they appear to provide administration products to healthcare providers and use Microsoft cloud to implement some of their products. More importantly they aim to reduce time-to-market and accelerate drug development, one of the main challenges facing COViD-19 drug manufacturers. \n\nIn their public sector business, they provide a management service to companies for AWS, Azure, VMware, Oracle and Google cloud platforms to  \"enable companies to focus on their strategic priorities while shifting the burden and expense of building and managing an hybrid cloud infrastructure\". Their website also shows:\n\n \n\n* 800+ managed cloud customers\n* Experts in complex, enterprise-scale transformation\n* 20,000+ Microsoft professionals/Microsoft Certified Solution Provider\n* 1,000+ AWS professionals/AWS Premier Consulting Partner\n* Managed services for Azure, AWS, VMware, Oracle, Google &amp; more\n* Full-stack Platform as a Service for SAP\n\nIn terms of their banking subset, they operate in over 70 countries, have processed in excess of 80 million payment accounts and service 250 million mortgages. They also provide security and analytics using AI and automation, for example helping NatWest, a major RBS group UK bank, move to image-based cheque-clearing. \n\nThese are a few examples of some of their operating industries but if you want to see more visit the website, I'm not doing all the work for you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Partners**\n\nThis is just a short section but they have over 200+ partners, showing potential for a wide customer base, a few are:\n\n* AT&amp;T (cloud services)\n* AWS\n* Google Cloud\n* Microsoft\n* HP\n* Dell\n* IBM\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nNow this is where it gets a bit tricky. All credit to u/fuzzyblankeet and Co. but no matter how many times I've smashed my head into their financials I still struggle to understand them. I'm gonna need some help with this bit from you guys in the comments.\n\n \n\n|Fiscal Quarter|Date reported|EPS forecast|EPS actual|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2019|02/06/2020|1.08|1.25|\n|Q3 2019|11/11/2019|1.44|1.38|\n|Q2 2019|08/08/2019|1.71|1.74|\n|Q1 2019|05/23/2019|2.07|2.19|\n\n \\*^(According to Nasdaq.com)\n\nI don't know why EPS seems to decrease every quarter despite them having what I consider to be a strong business model, however I will link their financials [here](https://www.dxc.technology/investor_relations/ds/140309-dxc_financial_reports) if the more experienced among you want to give feedback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI just wanted your opinion on whether this is a good trade for earnings next week as I'm looking for something to replace VTIQ as a money maker, I want them to go up more but need something less volatile. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: If you're coming to me for financial advice there's no hope.**\n\nAlso was looking at [Marvell Technology](https://www.marvell.com/) as they seem to be making moves in 5G and cloud computing, so feel free to feedback on that if you want to have a look.

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.
