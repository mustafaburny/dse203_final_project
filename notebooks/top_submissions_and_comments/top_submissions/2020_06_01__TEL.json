Currently, China has begun to lead the way toward recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and Chinese consumers are set to cement their status as crucial growth drivers for the industry going forward.

Based on data from data for the 2019 McKinsey China Luxury Report, the growth of China\u2019s luxury spending will be primarily driven by a significant uptick of upper-middle-class households. The total number of China\u2019s upper-middle-class households is expected to reach 350 million by 2025 with a compound annual growth rate of 28% from 2018 to 2025.\n\nAs part of Glory Star\u2019s content production strategies with international luxury brands, Glory Star will leverage its award-winning lifestyle content production services and social media platforms to help expand the online presence of these brands in China.
