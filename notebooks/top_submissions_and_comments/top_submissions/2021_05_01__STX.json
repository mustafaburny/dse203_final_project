        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3\n\nGME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \\[Redacted\\] as a payment option.\n\nNewcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\u00a0We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.\n\n**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \\[redacted\\], a new \\[redacted\\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.\n\n**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker\u2019s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it\u2019s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.\n\n**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford\u2019s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.\n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "I have done so much DD on this play and I really want to share it with you guys since WSB is the reason I started investing over a year ago.\n\nIn this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.\n\nThere is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.\n\n#Topics of discussion:\n\n* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks\n\n* WDC Fundamentals\n\n* Bear case\n\n#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early\n\nWDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&amp;A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. \n\n#Fundamentals\n\nWDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.\n\nWDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&amp;P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.\n\n#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it\n\nAn industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.\n\nThe new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. \n\nLet's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.\n\nThe network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.\n\nBut wait - there's more.\n\nWDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.\n\nA company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.\n\n#Bear case\n\nNobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.\n\nThe second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.\n\nThe third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. \n\n#Summary TL;DR\n\nHDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Positions\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[157 shares (Canadians unite!)](https://i.imgur.com/6y4p3ax.jpg)\n\n[1 leap Jan '23 70c](https://i.imgur.com/SAqvMhA.jpg)\n\nI believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency. STONKS ONLY GO UP",

        "selftext": "As the cloud &amp; big data continues to grow, as well as social media &amp; 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.\n\nLarge social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.\n\nThe need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.\n\nThere is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace\n\nFor reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021\n\nChia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.\n\nI have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.\n\nThis may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.\n\nIf we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.\n\nWhat's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.\n\nSeagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.\n\nMy positions: ~$21k Western Digital, ~$6k Seagate",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.\n\nNew economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. \n\nYesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Great vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.\n* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.\n* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it\u2019s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.\n* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon\u2019s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, \u201cThe real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM\u2019s talented team. It\u2019s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling \"\n* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21.

Another notable point is it\u2019s founders. According to Wikipedia, *the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.* This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions.

        "selftext": "I have done so much DD on this play and I really want to share it with you guys since WSB is the reason I started investing over a year ago.\n\nIn this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.\n\nThere is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.\n\n#Topics of discussion:\n\n*Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks\n\n*WDC Fundamentals\n\n*Bear case\n\n**If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early**\n\nWDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. They did saw a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&amp;A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. \n\n#Fundamentals\n\nWDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.\n\nWDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&amp;P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.\n\n#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it\n\nAn industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.\n\nThe new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. \n\nLet's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.\n\nThe network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.\n\nBut wait - there's more.\n\nWDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.\n\nA company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.\n\n#Bear case\n\nNobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.\n\nThe second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.\n\n#Summary TL;DR\n\nHDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Positions\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[157 shares (Canadians unite!)](https://i.imgur.com/6y4p3ax.jpg)\n\n[1 leap Jan '23 70c](https://i.imgur.com/SAqvMhA.jpg)\n\nI believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency. STONKS ONLY GO UP",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n*Processing img 1kx54njxev071...*\n\nGME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \\[Redacted\\] as a payment option.\n\n  \nNewcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)\n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7j2124y9fv071.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91b1207d45ad40ebacddc14e4b82a7d8e71325ca\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\u00a0We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.  \n\n**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \\[redacted\\], a new \\[redacted\\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.\n\n**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker\u2019s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it\u2019s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.\n\n**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford\u2019s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits. \n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. You can find a sample [here](https://imgur.com/wj1ynfG).  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "There are HDD shortages occurring due to a new technology called Chia. We are in the first inning of a new hardware shortage similar to the GPU shortage that pumped AMD and Nvidia to the moon. The new process is called Proof of Time and Space. This process is 100x more efficient than PoW and it is \"green\".  \n\n\nProof of Time and Space uses SSDs to perform massive amounts of reads and writes to generate a file called a \"plot.\" For every 1TB of plots stored on HDDs there are 18 TBs of writes to SSDs. This will cause SSDs to be purchased, used, then destroyed at a rapid rate. Most consumer grade SSDs are rated to 300-600TBW. After completed, plots are stored permanently on HDDs. The network is currently 4.6 exabytes and is increasing at a rate of 8% per day.   \n\n\n\"TrendForce market research estimated fourth-quarter 2019 shipment data from the three big players in the HDD market (Western Digital, Seagate, and Toshiba). They found that Seagate currently holds the lead at 41% of the market, followed by Western Digital (38%) and Toshiba (21%). However, the strength of the HDD market has been declining in recent years. TrendForce saw a 50% drop in shipments from data collected between 2012 and 2019.\"  \n\n\n$STX is the market leader but Papa Burry is in $WDC, he owns 150,000 shares, and I like $WDC so that is where I am focused.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/chia/comments/n2lren/thoughts\\_on\\_a\\_hdd\\_shortage\\_from\\_an\\_industry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chia/comments/n2lren/thoughts_on_a_hdd_shortage_from_an_industry/)  \nThis post is a great guide to factors within the HDD market. Demand within the HDD market comes from three segments: OEMs, cloud/data center, and retail like Best Buy or Amazon. OEMS and cloud/data center acquire hard drives on fixed long-term contracts so the channel to monitor for shortages and margin expansion is the retail channel.   \n\n\nThe main players shipped 1,000 exabytes of HDD in 2020 and existing untapped HDD can be used. To develop a framework for how much storage space is being sucked off the market by Chia you can assign a multiple to the network size based on how much storage space you believe is already acquired to be used at a later date. I am using a 2-4x multiple to get to 10-20 exabytes of market impact so far. Based on my calculations the Chia network will continue to be profitable until it hits a size of 100 exabytes at minimum. \n\n[https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/external-drives/wd-elements-desktop-usb-3-0-hdd#WDBWLG0180HBK-NESN](https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/external-drives/wd-elements-desktop-usb-3-0-hdd#WDBWLG0180HBK-NESN)  \n\n\nThis is an example of an HDD that would be used for Proof of Time and Space. Every variant above 8TB is sold out and Western Digital just repriced these about 50% higher than they were even a few weeks ago.   \n\n\nTL;DR  \nPapa Burry and I are long $WDC shares  \nLong $WDC July 21 85c, 100c   \nLong $WDC Oct 21 100c  \nLong $WDC Jan 22 70c, 90c",

        "selftext": "We are in the first inning of a new hardware shortage similar to the GPU shortage that pumped AMD and Nvidia to the moon. A new process called Proof of Time and Space is causing a hard drive shortage. This technology is 100x more efficient than PoW and it is \"green\".  \n\n\nTL;DR  \nPapa Burry and I are long $WDC shares  \nLong $WDC July 21 85c, 100c  \nLong $WDC Oct 21 100c  \nLong $WDC Jan 22 70c, 90c\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof of Time and Space uses SSDs to perform massive amounts of reads and writes to generate a file called a \"plot.\" For every 1TB of plots stored on HDDs there are 18 TBs of writes to SSDs. This will cause SSDs to be purchased, used, then destroyed at a rapid rate. Most consumer grade SSDs are rated to 300-600TBW. After completed, plots are stored permanently on HDDs. The network is currently 4.6 exabytes and is increasing at a rate of 8% per day.\n\n\"TrendForce market research estimated fourth-quarter 2019 shipment data from the three big players in the HDD market (Western Digital, Seagate, and Toshiba). They found that Seagate currently holds the lead at 41% of the market, followed by Western Digital (38%) and Toshiba (21%). However, the strength of the HDD market has been declining in recent years. TrendForce saw a 50% drop in shipments from data collected between 2012 and 2019.\"\n\n$STX is the market leader but Papa Burry is in $WDC, he owns 150,000 shares, and I like $WDC so that is where I am focused.\n\nThe main players shipped 1,000 exabytes of HDD in 2020 and existing untapped HDD can be used. To develop a framework for how much storage space is being sucked off the market by Chia you can assign a multiple to the network size based on how much storage space you believe is already acquired to be used at a later date. I am using a 2-4x multiple to get to 10-20 exabytes of market impact so far. Based on my calculations the Chia network will continue to be profitable until it hits a size of 100 exabytes at minimum.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.\n\nNew economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. \n\nYesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Great  vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.\n* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.\n* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it\u2019s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.\n* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon\u2019s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, \u201cThe real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM\u2019s talented team. It\u2019s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling \"\n* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.\n* Volkswagen sold more than 206,000 electric vehicles over the past 12 months in Western Europe, more than double the 102,500 made by Tesla over the same time period, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. \n* **\\*\\* Please note that the current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price.\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "I'm going to keep it short (and hope to avoid auto-moderation yanking this off despite it being a valid stock idea and discussion).\n\nYou can read about proof of space [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_space).\n\nBasically, from an interesting [article](tinyurl.com/3bumpnau\n) published yesterday:\n\n&gt;According to the South China Morning Post, hard-drive prices in China have begun to soar as chia miners stockpile storage. The price of 12-terabyte drives has increased by 59% since chia was announced in February this year, and most professional-quality hard drives with more than 8 terabytes of capacity are sold out.\n\n&gt;Vietnam is also seeing hard-drive shortages as a result of China\u2019s chia craze.\n\nAnd the very interesting part is this:\n\n&gt;Even before its official launch, chia has used more than an exabyte of data storage. \n\nIIRC, Seagate sales are about 400 exabytes per year and Western Digital is about the same or slightly more. If proof of space systems get traction and are accepted more widely, you could extrapolate storage usage growing by a factor of 100x or more at which point you're talking anywhere 5-25% of total annual capacity produced with those drives replaced at a rate of 20-30% / year.\n\nRight now, STX is trading at 14 x EV/EBITDA and WDC is trading at 13x EV/EBITDA. Multiples look even better based on '22 consensus EPS.\n\nI am not promoting the viability of proof of space (it doesn't even concern me that much), just the \"picks and shovels\" angle of possibly increased demand for mass storage which could even lead to improved margins.\n\nPlease do your own DD and have a good weekend.",

        "selftext": "As the cloud &amp; big data continues to grow, as well as social media &amp; 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.\n\nLarge social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows\n\nThe need for storage has been growing for decades, but Innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.\n\nThere is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace\n\nFor reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021\n\nChia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day\n\nI have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.\n\nThis may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.\n\nWhat's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.\n\nSeagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.",

        "selftext": "**E2Open ($ETWO)**\n\n**A 100% Cloud-Based SaaS Platform, And The Future Of Supply Chain Management**\n\nWith the Global Pandemic putting unprecedented strain on the national and global supply chain, and recent events such as the Suez Canal blockage, as well as the Semiconductor Shortage, there has never been a stronger demand for Supply Chain efficiency. President Joe Biden just recently began a 100-day assessment of the risks to supply chains, noting that the US\u2019\u2019 need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semis, EV batteries, and rare earth minerals. This is where E2Open ($ETWO) comes into play.\n\n**COMPANY SUMMARY**\n\n*\u201cLeaders win through logistics. Vision, sure. Strategy, yes. But when you go to war, you need to have both toilet paper and bullets at the right place at the right time. In other words, you must win through superior logistics.\u201d  \\~ Tom Peters*\n\nEssentially an unknown up-and-coming company that provides cloud-based, on-demand supply chain software that offers customers a significant value proposition. ETWO helps customers reduce inventory costs (10-20%), reduce direct materials procurement operating costs (50%), improve inventory forecasts (15-50%), and reduce supply chain staff (15%).\n\nETWO has only recently went public on February 21\u2019, yet this relatively new company has already acquired and secured clients such as Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, AMD, Nike, and many more (See Image Below for a better overall picture of its customer base). Another notable point is it\u2019s founders. According to Wikipedia, *the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.* This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions. The company is also trading very cheap in comparison to it\u2019s fundamentals and it\u2019s peers (Scroll down for a slightly deeper dive).\n\n* *A Snapshot of its largest customer base:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwe5biyquuw61.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2bc97da035fdd0cc0d84e11686aa40166f5c91\n\n* *A Snapshot Of Their Investment Thesis:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1v3wk1uuuw61.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3530ce3826ed67513c7797afd4bb1a3a0d54e56a\n\n**Key Qualities Of ETWO, and Competitive Advantages It Has Over Its Competitors:**\n\n* Multi-enterprise network combining data with best-in-class intelligent applications\n* integrated cloud platform delivering meaning ROI across supply chain\n* First mover advantages from data connectors and harmonization\n* Long term relationships with blue-chip, large enterprise customer base\n* Attractive industry tailwinds and large TAM with significant white space\n* Category-defining End-to-End provider of mission-critical software\n* Strong network effects enhanced by flexible and integrated data model\n\n**Key issues for current supply chains and how $ETWO is solving them:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tm9r4jdyuuw61.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd452f13403ddf6f1c43151b9fca9415d9aa1826\n\n*A Visual Of $ETWO 's business model:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pts7oo10vuw61.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b50c7097f059b98ffb48f2e8134628860fccf700\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nThe stock itself offers value to shareholders due to it\u2019s very cheap valuation compared to its peers, as well as it\u2019s massive potential for growth. At its current valuation, $ETWO is trading at an estimated EV/Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11.7 among it\u2019s peers. It also boasts an EV/EBITDA of 21.3 compared to 29.2 and 59.1 from it\u2019s two closest competitors, Descartes and Kinaxis. \n\nOne of the most important value factors for SaaS platforms is in the recurring cash flow. In $ETWO's case, this comes from it's subscription sales, which provides some much valued predictability in these uncertain times . This is another strength that $ETWO possesses, as the company boasts an extremely low churn rate - which is a an indicator of a massive moat, which can allow $ETWO to retain profits from its competitors. This only further demonstrates that the company is due for strong future growth. Below are some visuals which exemplify the value of ETWO:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Strong Performance on Key Metrics:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wirah1d2vuw61.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75ae35151c09a121def921cb6bd42c03c947c563\n\n* Attractive Long Term Financial Profile:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9intlpp3vuw61.png?width=1869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba50479fab89957024b271cc1223ddb2e25d83a1\n\n* Growth and Profitability:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52quo145vuw61.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93bbeb7ace2f303d45c68a5cf90bd616cff90c8\n\n**What Wallstreet is Saying**\n\n*\u201cIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.  If you think about that, you\u2019ll do things differently.\u201d  \\~ Warren Buffett,*\n\nAlthough it is a relatively new and low profile company (for now), it seems Wall Street is already taking notice. Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company:\n\n*\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"*\n\n**One Final and Intriguing Note:**\n\nA few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it\u2019s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post).\n\nShort Interest:\n\n[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh\\_opt\\_option,sh\\_short\\_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh_opt_option,sh_short_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO)\n\nI am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light.\n\nPut/Call Ratio:\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios)\n\nAnyone interested in some further reading on the company, should check out this solid write up on $ETWO, as it makes some great points that I missed in mine:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl\\_cc\\_neuberger\\_principal\\_holdings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl_cc_neuberger_principal_holdings/)\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nThe cheaply valued ETWO and it\u2019s value proposition, it\u2019s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it\u2019s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist. The growth potential is massive, the fundamentals are strong, and I believe we are looking at, in ETWO, the future of the supply chain management industry.\n\n*Disclosure: This is by no means financial advice. I just like the stock. I also must disclose that I have both shares and December call options for $ETWO. I am an individual investor, with no association whatsoever with the company.*",

        "selftext": " **E2Open ($ETWO)**\n\n**A 100% Cloud-Based SaaS Platform, And The Future Of Supply Chain Management**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Note\\* I posted this a few days ago on WSB. Mods deleted it (probably not enough rocket emojis), so I figured this might be a more suitable place for discussion!. Cheers!\n\nWith the Global Pandemic putting unprecedented strain on the national and global supply chain, and recent events such as the Suez Canal blockage, as well as the Semiconductor Shortage, there has never been a stronger demand for Supply Chain efficiency. President Joe Biden just recently began a 100-day assessment of the risks to supply chains, noting that the US\u2019\u2019 need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semis, EV batteries, and rare earth minerals. This is where E2Open ($ETWO) comes into play.\n\n**COMPANY SUMMARY**\n\n*\u201cLeaders win through logistics. Vision, sure. Strategy, yes. But when you go to war, you need to have both toilet paper and bullets at the right place at the right time. In other words, you must win through superior logistics.\u201d \\~ Tom Peters*\n\nEssentially an unknown up-and-coming company that provides cloud-based, on-demand supply chain software that offers customers a significant value proposition. ETWO helps customers reduce inventory costs (10-20%), reduce direct materials procurement operating costs (50%), improve inventory forecasts (15-50%), and reduce supply chain staff (15%).\n\nETWO has only recently went public on February 21\u2019, yet this relatively new company has already acquired and secured clients such as Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, AMD, Nike, and many more (See Image Below for a better overall picture of its customer base). Another notable point is it\u2019s founders. According to Wikipedia, *the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.* This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions. The company is also trading very cheap in comparison to it\u2019s fundamentals and it\u2019s peers (Scroll down for a slightly deeper dive).\n\n* *A Snapshot of its largest customer base:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5y53bq4inww61.jpg?width=1194&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1467048a3391c0da2fe641472522f200b7fcf016\n\n* *A Snapshot Of Their Investment Thesis:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7v8dt8rjnww61.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80b6e61352dd21cf6df02c9aebb4f2286fc83a01\n\n**Key Qualities Of ETWO, and Competitive Advantages It Has Over Its Competitors:**\n\n* Multi-enterprise network combining data with best-in-class intelligent applications\n* integrated cloud platform delivering meaning ROI across supply chain\n* First mover advantages from data connectors and harmonization\n* Long term relationships with blue-chip, large enterprise customer base\n* Attractive industry tailwinds and large TAM with significant white space\n* Category-defining End-to-End provider of mission-critical software\n* Strong network effects enhanced by flexible and integrated data model\n\n**Key issues for current supply chains and how $ETWO is solving them:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkuxw31onww61.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07d09fcf3e6f6e965ae82f6a48b77f2504896919\n\n*A Visual Of $ETWO 's business model:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2u9riftpnww61.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4c32567357a0a5df16fe3df3efa83d2239f20c4\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nThe stock itself offers value to shareholders due to it\u2019s very cheap valuation compared to its peers, as well as it\u2019s massive potential for growth. At its current valuation, $ETWO is trading at an estimated EV/Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11.7 among it\u2019s peers. It also boasts an EV/EBITDA of 21.3 compared to 29.2 and 59.1 from it\u2019s two closest competitors, Descartes and Kinaxis.\n\nOne of the most important value factors for SaaS platforms is in the recurring cash flow. In $ETWO's case, this comes from it's subscription sales, which provides some much valued predictability in these uncertain times . This is another strength that $ETWO possesses, as the company boasts an extremely low churn rate - which is a an indicator of a massive moat, which can allow $ETWO to retain profits from its competitors. This only further demonstrates that the company is due for strong future growth. Below are some visuals which exemplify the value of ETWO:\n\n* Strong Performance on Key Metrics:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqz514frnww61.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7da8635fcc90ddc8313cf63284602b07a639e32\n\n* Attractive Long Term Financial Profile:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ypg366qsnww61.png?width=1869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a55558eaba519a8a3ac9d16fb0b0648c058a38c\n\n* Growth and Profitability:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sgqj03unww61.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8b16e1fda840fb7d6c0fd2a7c9192dd645dfbe5\n\n**What Wallstreet is Saying**\n\n*\u201cIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you\u2019ll do things differently.\u201d \\~ Warren Buffett,*\n\nAlthough it is a relatively new and low profile company (for now), it seems Wall Street is already taking notice. Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company:\n\n*\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"*\n\n**One Final and Intriguing Note:**\n\nA few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it\u2019s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post).\n\nShort Interest:\n\n[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh\\_opt\\_option,sh\\_short\\_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh_opt_option,sh_short_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO)\n\nI am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light.\n\nPut/Call Ratio:\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios)\n\nAnyone interested in some further reading on the company, should check out this solid write up on $ETWO, as it makes some great points that I missed in mine:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl\\_cc\\_neuberger\\_principal\\_holdings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl_cc_neuberger_principal_holdings/)\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nThe cheaply valued ETWO and it\u2019s value proposition, it\u2019s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it\u2019s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist. The growth potential is massive, the fundamentals are strong, and I believe we are looking at, in ETWO, the future of the supply chain management industry.\n\n*Disclosure: This is by no means financial advice. I just like the stock. I also must disclose that I have both shares and December call options for $ETWO. I am an individual investor, with no association whatsoever with the company.*",

        "selftext": "I'm going to keep it short (and hope to avoid auto-moderation yanking this off despite it being a valid stock idea and discussion).\n\nYou can read about proof of space [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_space).\n\nBasically, from an interesting [article](tinyurl.com/3bumpnau\n) published yesterday:\n\n&gt;According to the South China Morning Post, hard-drive prices in China have begun to soar as chia miners stockpile storage. The price of 12-terabyte drives has increased by 59% since chia was announced in February this year, and most professional-quality hard drives with more than 8 terabytes of capacity are sold out.\n\n&gt;Vietnam is also seeing hard-drive shortages as a result of China\u2019s chia craze.\n\nAnd the very interesting part is this:\n\n&gt;Even before its official launch, chia has used more than an exabyte of data storage. \n\nIIRC, Seagate sales are about 400 exabytes per year and Western Digital is about the same or slightly more. If proof of space systems get traction and are accepted more widely, you could extrapolate storage usage growing by a factor of 100x or more at which point you're talking anywhere 5-25% of total annual capacity produced with those drives replaced at a rate of 20-30% / year.\n\nRight now, STX is trading at 14 x EV/EBITDA and WDC is trading at 13x EV/EBITDA. Multiples look even better based on '22 consensus EPS.\n\nI am not promoting the viability of proof of space (it doesn't even concern me that much), just the \"picks and shovels\" angle of possibly increased demand for mass storage which could even lead to improved margins.\n\nPlease do your own DD and have a good weekend.",
