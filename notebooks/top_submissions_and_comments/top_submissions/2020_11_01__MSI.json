        "selftext": "I'm new to investing and the stockmarket so please forgive me if I haven't posted enough info about what I want to do. And apologies in advance if I'm flagrantly misusing the wrong terminology too!\n\nThat being said, I have a lot of knowledge of video games so I wanted to first invest in esports and video game streaming.\n\nI am currently interested in Tencent, Huya and Activision Blizzard.\n\nTencent because they have League of Legends and the tournaments associated... as well a large holding in Huya and Douya who are set to merge creating a massive video game streaming service in China akin to Twitch. Tencent are also a very large multi-media company owning many other communications and technology businesses etc\n\nHuya since they are a large streaming platform and is quite a cheap stock (for me).\n\nActivision-Blizzard since they have some good video game IP's and a good hold of esports tournaments and video games which I think will grow. They own the esports competitions in which their games take place.\n\nIn general, I'm not sure about EA and tournaments for sports games, I just don't think it will grow like games akin to CS:GO, LoL, SC2. Activision Blizzard does have some failing games I think right now. Activions-Blizzards own Overwatch and Hearthstone games are dying and I don't see anything big coming out. CoD Warzone has proved popular but I dont think the new CoD's will generate near enough excitement as they used to.\n\nPerhaps I should invest in some hyper casual games and mobile apps too (Sciplay, King etc) but I am curious as to what others think!\n\nTo diversify and invest in some infrastructure im thinking to invest in AMD or Nvidia and perhaps MSI as well.\n\nAgain this is my first dip into the lake, and I wanted to start with video game related stocks. I will definitely invest in others to diversify my portfolio. What do other people think with video games right now, and is it a good place for me to start? I find the whole sector really interesting and it's something close to my heart as a passionate long time video gamer :)",
