What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2.

        "selftext": "Welcome to another Unusual Options Activity post. Why do DD when you can see what stocks people are heavily investing in? I post these daily.\n\n**Context -**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 increased by 0.5% today. There was positive news recording a vaccine and Pfizer. PFE notably had the highest number of contracts traded for the day. The ADP Employment Change Report for June again showed gains for private-sector payrolls. The ISM Manufacturing Index for June beat consensus with 52.6% (consensus was 49.2%). The communication services, utilities, and real estate sector led the market higher, increasing +1.8%, +1.9%, +1.9%, respectively.\n\n*Today\u2019s Option Activity Fast Facts -*\n\n***Sentiment \u2013 CBOE Put/Call Ratio -*** 0.90, VIX: (28.96, -1.47, -4.8%). \n\n***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** DXC with 46 x the ADV of 4173. There were 96199 calls and 94803 puts.\n\n***Ticker with Most Contracts -*** PFE with 329836 contracts traded today with an AVD of 95042. There were 277805 calls and 52031 puts.\n\n***Largest Put / Call Ratio -*** MUR with a 102.87 P/C ratio. There were 30142 puts and 293 calls.\n\n***Largest Call / Put Ratio -*** SKX with a 97.16 C/P ratio. There were 34978 calls and 360 puts. \n\n*\\*Stocks must be &gt;$6, Highest Multiple must have &gt;1k ADV, Largest ratios must have an option volume &gt;10k*\n\n*MOMENTUM UNUSUAL OPTION ACTIVITY -*\n\n***First Momentum Stock Pick -***\n\n**Ticker :**  AA 10.95  -0.29 ,( -2.58 %)  **Earnings :** 2020-07-15\n\n**Name :** Alcoa Corp.  **Sector :** Non-Energy Minerals\n\n**Special Considerations :**   **Industry :** Aluminum\n\n**Option Information -**\n\n *Today\u2019s Option Volume:* 41029  *OptionOI:* 208019\n\n *ADV:* 10621  ***Multiple of ADV:*** **4**\n\n *Total Calls:* 37921  *Total Puts:* 3108\n\n ***Calls at Ask:*** **43.0 %**  *Calls at Bid:* 32.3 %  ***C/P Ratio:*** **12.2**\n\n *Puts at Ask:* 28.1 %  *Puts at Bid:* 21.4 %   *P/C Ratio:* 0.1 \n\n**Notable Strikes :**\n\n**JUL 10 \u201920 12C** had 29.9k VLM with a 2.12k OI. \n\n**DarkPool Prints :**\n\nNone \n\n**News : 24-Jun-20 6:10 pm:** **USTR conducting review that could lead to $3.1 bln in additional tariffs on EU imports**\n\n**My Impression :**\n\nYesterday featured MT which is a steel company. The hypothesis was the call volume at the time may have been related to some sort of new tariffs being enacted. It appears there was confirmation of this yesterday after I posted.  I\u2019ll likely be picking up some shares of this tomorrow. \n\n***Featured Trade: SHLL***\n\nI don\u2019t make featured trade posts often, because these opportunities do not come around all that frequently.\n\nSHLL added options today. There has been significant number of comparisons between NKLA and SHLL. The premiums are very high, especially for the puts. SHLL is a SPAC - or a Special Acquisition Company. These stocks typically have a floor of $10.\n\n\"A typical SPAC will offer stock at $10 per share and give the management team two years to find a suitable target. If the SPAC doesn\u2019t find a good merger candidate, then its terms call for it to liquidate. Unless the SPAC finds a candidate, the money raised in the IPO is held in trust, and so IPO investors typically get most or all of their $10 initial investment back.\" - Sorry can't provide links, but it was a motley fool article. You can search for it if you are interested. \n\nThe Hyliion and SHLL merger is slated to go through sometime in Q3, September or October. **The premium for the OCT 16 '20 25Ps is high. I sold 10 of them for 11.70.** I was the only volume at this strike price at the time. A few others have decided to follow the trade, but the volume is still low. This makes my break-even price for SHLL 13.30. \n\nHypothetically, if the merger does not go through the floor for the stock should be right around $10. It can go lower, but it is less likely.\u00a0**You are essentially risking about 3.30 for a maximum upside profit of 11.70.**\u00a0Not a bad return. Other risks include SHLL being sub $10 after the merger. \n\nThis is the first day that SHLL has had options. The option chain was not available on all brokers, however, it was present on IB. The option OI and VLM reflects that it is not available on all brokers. You should exercise caution because as of right now the low volume is causing wide spreads, which likely helped my fill. Right now, the largest call that can be bought is the 30C. I would expect the option chain to be extended tomorrow or in the next few days. People are likely to buy a lot of OTM calls and force the MMs to start delta hedging the sold call so there is a potential catalyst for this stock to move significantly higher in the nearer term.\n\n**There is no such thing as a risk free trade, but there are good bets. I think this is a good bet with limited downside risk.**\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 These are my observations that I have made at the end of each day and trades that I am considering placing or watching. I am not responsible for your financial losses if you follow any of these trades. As always, do your due diligence.",

I am curious to know what you guys think about BA? With it previously trading in the 380s and now sitting low at 180, I feel like it sounds like a great choice since I plan to stay with it for many many years. But the advice on fidelity essentially says, bear- sell sell sell so it makes me hesitant. What is your opinion?",
