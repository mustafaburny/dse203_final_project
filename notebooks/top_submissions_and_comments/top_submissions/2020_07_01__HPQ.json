I'll flesh it out AH\n\nI\u2019ve been following HPE ever since I read an article on how massively computer sales are up\u2014HPE was listed as the number one in sales compared to last year during COVID. Because it can be fickle I sat it on my watchlist until something pushed it over the top. This article isn\u2019t the one I originally found, but it came out today and kind of sums it up. They\u2019ll beat earnings expectations based on PC sales.  \n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/13/q2-wont-be-as-bad-for-hp-and-apple-as-feared-for-o.aspx\n\nHPE just acquired Silver Peak [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hewlett-packard-enterprise-to-acquire-silver-peak-for-925-million-2020-07-13](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hewlett-packard-enterprise-to-acquire-silver-peak-for-925-million-2020-07-13) this morning. This is really complimentary to their company deficits while also complimenting their current offering, and expands them into the networking space.\n\nThe acquisition alone is enough for a little pop, but combined with the computer sales and upcoming earnings excitement you can expect every tom dick and harry to be offering price target upgrades in the coming days.\n\nI\u2019m very confident in this one, and usually when I\u2019m confident in a play it\u2019s worked out\u2014you can check out some of my other DD\u2019s. If it\u2019s breaks 9.50 it\u2019s running. It\u2019s up over 1% on the day since the news about the acquisition an hour ago.\n\nI do my daily updates and stuff on twitter of the same username because it's much easier to react to news and stuff; I've pumped this like 3 times this morning in the daily thread for no upvotes but its up 2% since then.  Doing this for y'all\n\nHPE 7/17 9.50c\n\nHPE 7/24 9.50c\n\nHPE 8/21 10c",

While investing in ESG covers a broad range of themes, we are focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices or that may benefit, both operationally and economically, from our management team\u2019s commitment and expertise in executing such practices. We believe our management team\u2019s experience allows us to evaluate targets in industries such as **manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others**. Furthermore, our target universe could include **companies undergoing a transition to increase their environmental sustainability profiles**, reflecting an opportunity to bring environmentally sustainable practices to companies that may not have historically been focused on environmental sustainability. We believe there is a wide array of companies undergoing this **\u201cbrown-to-green\u201d transition** in our target universe.
