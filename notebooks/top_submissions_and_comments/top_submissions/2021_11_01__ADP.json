Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, November 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures are slightly lower ahead of the Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt;U.S. stock futures were muted in morning trading Wednesday as investors awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on its move to start withdrawing the support it has been providing.\n*****\n&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 51 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were about flat and Nasdaq 100 futures rose slightly. All three major averages closed at record highs on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt;Lyft jumped nearly 13% in after hours trading on better-than-expected third-quarter results. Zillow fell more than 11% after announcing it will close its home buying and flipping business. Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond rose on a partnership announcement with Kroger but the nearly 70% after hours surge that followed was likely fueled by a short squeeze.\n*****\n&gt;Activision shares tumbled, falling nearly 12% after it said the launch of two games would be delayed. The company also issued a weaker holiday outlook thought it did beat profit estimates for the quarter.\n*****\n&gt;Investors are focused on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce the timeline for a gradual reduction in its bond-buying program Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day meeting. They\u2019ll also be listening for clues on when the central bank plans to raise interest rates.\n*****\n&gt;Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to stress that the reduction process known as tapering does not equate to tightening policy. Traders are pricing in a more aggressive path of interest rate hikes than the Fed is anticipating, so Powell may try to talk the market down.\n*****\n&gt;However, the Fed also will have to show that it is not ignoring the rise in inflation that has taken price increases to their fastest in 30 years.\n*****\n&gt;\u201cWith the S&amp;P 500 up 13 days in the past 15 ahead of the Fed beginning the process of draining the punch bowl, there certainly is a lot of confidence that strong earnings will overcome everything,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, Bleakley Advisory Group\u2019s CIO. \u201cThat said, global monetary tightening is taking place, not just with the Fed, and that should not be ignored either.\u201d\n*****\n&gt;Equities rose Tuesday as companies continued to deliver strong earnings reports. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far this earnings season, 83% of them have beat consensus expectations, according to FactSet. That\u2019s despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, commodity inflation, central bank policy and Covid risk.\n*****\n&gt;\u201cStocks are like the Energizer Bunny, as they continue to soar to new highs and show no signs of tiring,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. \u201cWe understand all of the worries out there, but the bottom line is earnings continue to come in way better than expected and are helping to justify stocks are current levels.\u201d\n*****\n&gt;In regular trading on Tuesday, the Dow rose 138.79 points to 36,052.63. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%. All three major averages closed at records for the third session in a row. The small cap Russell 2000 rose slightly and closed at an all-time high.\n*****\n&gt;Those highs are making a potential year-end rally more conceivable to investors.\n*****\n&gt;\u201cThe primary market trend appears higher,\u201d said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist. \u201cIn the eight periods since 1950 where stocks were up more than 20% through October, as they are this year, the S&amp;P 500 tacked on additional gains by year end 100% of the time with an average gain of 6.2%.\u201d\n*****\n&gt;Investors also will get a look at the jobs market when payrolls processing firm ADP releases its report on private employment at 8:15 a.m. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the report to show that companies added 395,000 positions for October.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Wf2hYRW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/89gzKEg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9lgAdYt.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/x7hp9kA.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FaJGsTP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NEDfnVZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PO8PDmD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sL25oda.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/P9B5yKL.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/oanbitM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Yft5V2z.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NP13Eo5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Oe83FFf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/M1LqG0r.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/eIl1umd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/nJS8qed.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/K9FEInj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-new-york-times-cvs-health-humana-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **New York Times (NYT)** \u2013 The newspaper publisher\u2019s shares jumped 3.9% in the premarket after it beat estimates by 3 cents with an adjusted quarterly profit of 23 cents per share.

Zillow fell more than 11% after announcing it will close its home buying and flipping business. Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond rose on a partnership announcement with Kroger but the nearly 70% after hours surge that followed was likely fueled by a short squeeze.\n*****\n&gt;Activision shares tumbled, falling nearly 12% after it said the launch of two games would be delayed.

        "selftext": " \n\nThree of the world\u2019s four largest sector-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) face a shake-up due to proposed changes in their composition that would reclassify major companies in information technology indexes as financial or industrial.\n\nS&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC and MSCI Inc. have launched a consultation on a potential revamp of the widely followed global industry classification standards (GICS) that determine in which sector each company is placed.\n\nThis debate could have meaningful consequences, with the weighting of banks in the US$45.7-billion Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund [XLF-A](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/XLF-A/), as well as other ETFs, such as US$11.6-billion Vanguard Financials ETF [VFH-A](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/VFH-A/), falling below one-third, from a peak of 45.4 per cent in 2013 according to S&amp;P data, if the proposed changes come into force.\n\nHowever, the US$49-billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund [XLK-A](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/XLK-A/), the world\u2019s largest sector ETF, according to data from TrackInsight SAS, and the US$48.2-billion Vanguard Information Technology Index ETF [VGT-A](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/VGT-A/) would become both more cyclical \u2013 prone to rise and fall in line with the economy \u2013 and more concentrated as the sector is stripped of several stocks, including three of its eight largest.\n\n\u201cSome of the largest information technology companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index could be changing sectors,\u201d says Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research.\n\n\u201cAt least seven of its large-cap company sector constituents are potentially moving to a new sector,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth adds, with the knock-on effect that \u201cbanks would no longer dominate broad financial ETFs.\u201d\n\nMSCI and S&amp;P are proposing that \u201ctransaction and payment processing companies\u201d are switched from the information technology sector of the GICS framework to the financial sector.\n\nThis would impact companies such as Visa Inc. [V-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/V-N/), Mastercard Inc. [MA-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MA-N/) and PayPal Holdings Inc. [PYPL-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/PYPL-Q/), which have a combined market capitalization of more than US$1-trillion and are, respectively, the fourth-, sixth- and eighth-largest stocks in the IT sector.\n\nThe technology category would be further denuded by being stripped of its data-processing and outsourced services, and payroll processing subindustry groupings, which would be switched to the industrial sector under the proposals. This would impact companies such as Fidelity National Information Services Inc. [FIS-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/FIS-N/), Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. [BR-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/BR-N/), and Automatic Data Processing Inc. [AFP-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/ADP-Q/).\n\nThe proposed changes would result in heightened concentration in the technology sector, coming as they do on top of a 2018 reshuffle that saw Facebook Inc., now known as Meta Platforms Inc. [FB-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/FB-Q/), Twitter Inc. [TWTR-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/TWTR-N/), Snap Inc. [SNAP-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/SNAP-N/) and Alphabet Inc. [GOOGL-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/GOOGL-Q/), the parent of Google, transferred to communications services.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. [MSFT-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MSFT-Q/) and Apple Inc. [AAPL-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/AAPL-Q/) already account for a combined 44.7 per cent of the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index, even before the latest proposals.\n\nHowever, Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors, says ETFs such as his firm\u2019s Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund would be unlikely to increase their exposure to Microsoft and Apple much further.\n\nUnder the rules of the Technology Select Sector Index, tracked by Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, an individual company\u2019s weight is capped at 23 per cent, while the sum of stocks with weights greater than 4.8 per cent cannot exceed 50 per cent of the index.\n\nThese rules mean the weighting of the two giants, as well as Nvidia Corp. [NVDA-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/NVDA-Q/), the third-largest stock in the sector, effectively cannot rise any further, meaning that the weighting of the next ranked companies, such as Adobe Systems Inc. [ADBE-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/ADBE-Q/), Salesforce.com Inc. [CRM-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/CRM-N/) and Cisco Systems Inc. [CSCO-Q](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/CSCO-Q/), will need to be bumped up artificially to take the slack.\n\nMr. Bartolini says this is unlikely to significantly affect the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s performance, though.\n\n\u201cWhat we see currently in funds is some difference relative to the S&amp;P 500 \\[IT index\\] itself because of the capping. We have to overweight some smaller names, but historically these weighting differences haven\u2019t had a significant impact on the fund because we are still diversified within the sector itself. The movement of the sector will drive the sector\u2019s return,\u201d Mr. Bartolini says.\n\nThe proposed changes would be likely to increase the level of risk in technology funds such as the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. Visa, Mastercard and PayPal have five-year betas of between 1.1 and 0.92, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ, meaning they broadly tend to rise and fall in line with the wider market. Most other tech stocks have higher betas than that, meaning they tend to be more volatile.\n\nThe switch, assuming it happens, may also have a downward impact on the valuation of the likes of Mastercard. While there\u2019s no logical reason for a company to be rated more lowly simply because it has changed sector \u2013 it is still the same business \u2013 a company that has been transferred will now be measured against a different peer group.\n\nFinancial Select Sector SPDR Fund, the financial sector ETF, trades on a price-to-book ratio of just 1.7 and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.8, compared to 11.5 and 28.6, respectively, for Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund.\n\n\u201cThere is likely to be some market impact because these companies are being judged against a different peer group,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth says.\n\nBased on current valuations, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal would be among the five-largest constituents of the financial sector, alongside JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. [JPM-M-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/JPM-M-N/) and Bank of America Corp. [BAC-N](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/BAC-N/).\n\nThey would be likely to damp volatility in the sector, given that the larger banks typically have betas of about 1.5.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to think of tech as low risk but does this reduce the risk profile of the financial sector? I think it does,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth says. The trio of newcomers were likely to have stronger growth prospects than banks and insurers, he adds, but be more expensive, while rendering the financial sector less interest rate sensitive.\n\nAs a consequence, the weighting of the banking industry within the financial sector would fall from 39 per cent to 31 per cent, on current valuations.\n\nMSCI and S&amp;P are currently consulting on the proposals, with a decision due in February.",

The company also issued a weaker holiday outlook thought it did beat profit estimates for the quarter.\n*****\n&gt;Investors are focused on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce the timeline for a gradual reduction in its bond-buying program Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day meeting. They\u2019ll also be listening for clues on when the central bank plans to raise interest rates.\n*****\n&gt;Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to stress that the reduction process known as tapering does not equate to tightening policy. Traders are pricing in a more aggressive path of interest rate hikes than the Fed is anticipating, so Powell may try to talk the market down.\n*****\n&gt;However, the Fed also will have to show that it is not ignoring the rise in inflation that has taken price increases to their fastest in 30 years.\n*****\n&gt;\u201cWith the S&amp;P 500 up 13 days in the past 15 ahead of the Fed beginning the process of draining the punch bowl, there certainly is a lot of confidence that strong earnings will overcome everything,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, Bleakley Advisory Group\u2019s CIO. \u201cThat said, global monetary tightening is taking place, not just with the Fed, and that should not be ignored either.\u201d\n*****\n&gt;Equities rose Tuesday as companies continued to deliver strong earnings reports. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far this earnings season, 83% of them have beat consensus expectations, according to FactSet. That\u2019s despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, commodity inflation, central bank policy and Covid risk.\n*****\n&gt;\u201cStocks are like the Energizer Bunny, as they continue to soar to new highs and show no signs of tiring,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. \u201cWe understand all of the worries out there, but the bottom line is earnings continue to come in way better than expected and are helping to justify stocks are current levels.\u201d\n*****\n&gt;In regular trading on Tuesday, the Dow rose 138.79 points to 36,052.63. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%. All three major averages closed at records for the third session in a row. The small cap Russell 2000 rose slightly and closed at an all-time high.\n*****\n&gt;Those highs are making a potential year-end rally more conceivable to investors.\n*****\n&gt;\u201cThe primary market trend appears higher,\u201d said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist. \u201cIn the eight periods since 1950 where stocks were up more than 20% through October, as they are this year, the S&amp;P 500 tacked on additional gains by year end 100% of the time with an average gain of 6.2%.\u201d\n*****\n&gt;Investors also will get a look at the jobs market when payrolls processing firm ADP releases its report on private employment at 8:15 a.m. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the report to show that companies added 395,000 positions for October.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Wf2hYRW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/89gzKEg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9lgAdYt.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/x7hp9kA.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FaJGsTP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NEDfnVZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PO8PDmD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sL25oda.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/P9B5yKL.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/oanbitM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Yft5V2z.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NP13Eo5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Oe83FFf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/M1LqG0r.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/eIl1umd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/nJS8qed.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/K9FEInj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* OCGN\n* AMC\n* BCRX\n* ARPA.X\n* BBBY\n* LKNCY\n* UONE\n* Z\n* CAR\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-new-york-times-cvs-health-humana-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **New York Times (NYT)** \u2013 The newspaper publisher\u2019s shares jumped 3.9% in the premarket after it beat estimates by 3 cents with an adjusted quarterly profit of 23 cents per share.

        "selftext": "TLDR:  I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a  selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.\n\n# Observations/Assumptions\n\nBefore  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.\n\n* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.\n* For most people it is impossible to time the market\n* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.\n* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.\n* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)\n* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)\n* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).\n* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)\n* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.\n* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.\n* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:\n   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.\n   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don\u2019t want to support.\n   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nUsing  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.\n\n# Experiment 2020\n\n750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies\u2019 average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:\n\n* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1\n* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2\n* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3\n\nFor  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.\n\nThis was done for all of the metrics below:\n\n* ROE\n* Revenue Growth %\n* EBITDA %\n* FCF %\n\nThe  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.\n\nAny stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.\n\n[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)\n\nROE Example\n\nThat left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.\n\nThis  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?\n\nThat left 26 across 7 sectors.\n\n[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)\n\n**2020 Industry Breakdown**\n\nThese  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.\n\n2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\nCan we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.\n\n# Experiment 2021\n\n2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:\n\n* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company\n* Profit Margin \u2013 shows how effective the business is at making money\n* Operating Margin \u2013 shows how much money the company earns on its revenue\n* FCF Margin \u2013 shows how efficient a company is with their cash\n* EBITDA Margin \u2013 shows a companies\u2019 operating profitability\n* ROE \u2013 shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money\n* ROA \u2013 shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits\n* ROIC \u2013 shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns\n* Debt/Equity Ratio \u2013 shows the financial stability of a company\n\nMore  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:\n\n\u00b7  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.\n\nEach  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%,  Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.\n\nI  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn\u2019t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.\n\nHere is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:\n\n[Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)\n\nHere is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company\u2019s most recent year):\n\n[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)\n\nHere is an example of the visualizations for the data:\n\n[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)\n\nI  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.\n\nNext,  I read the description of \\~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn\u2019t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it\u2019s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \\~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I\u2019d  need to build a separate model.\n\nI  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \\~75.\n\nWe were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:\n\n[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)\n\nI then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.\n\n2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Industry Classification\n\n* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.\n   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.\n   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren\u2019t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.\n* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.\n   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.\n   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).\n   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.\n\n# 2020 Stocks\n\nABMD\n\nADBE\n\nANET\n\nBWXT\n\nCRL\n\nDG\n\nENR\n\nETSY\n\nEXEL\n\nICLR\n\nISRG\n\nKLAC\n\nLKQ\n\nLRCX\n\nMNST\n\nMPWR\n\nMTCH\n\nOLED\n\nPAYC\n\nPHM\n\nTER\n\nTTD\n\nUI\n\nVEEV\n\nVMW\n\nVRTX\n\n# 2021 Stocks\n\nAAON\n\nAAPL\n\nACN\n\nADBE\n\nAEIS\n\nALGN\n\nAMAT\n\nANET\n\nAPH\n\nATR\n\nATVI\n\nAX\n\nBLD\n\nCDNS\n\nCGNX\n\nCHD\n\nCHE\n\nCORT\n\nCPRT\n\nDLB\n\nDORM\n\nEPAM\n\nESNT\n\nETSY\n\nEW\n\nEXPD\n\nEXPO\n\nFAST\n\nFB\n\nFIX\n\nFOXF\n\nFTNT\n\nGGG\n\nGOOG\n\nGRMN\n\nHEI.A\n\nHELE\n\nIDA\n\nINS\n\nINTC\n\nINTU\n\nIRBT\n\nISRG\n\nCCSI\n\nZD\n\nKLAC\n\nLRCX\n\nLULU\n\nMASI\n\nMED\n\nMKSI\n\nMKTX\n\nMNST\n\nMORN\n\nMPWR\n\nMSFT\n\nNMIH\n\nNRC\n\nNVDA\n\nODFL\n\nOLED\n\nOLLI\n\nPAYC\n\nPAYX\n\nPRLB\n\nQLYS\n\nREGN\n\nRMR\n\nROAD\n\nSCCO\n\nSFBS\n\nSLP\n\nSTMP\n\nTDY\n\nTER\n\nTREX\n\nTROW\n\nTTD\n\nTYL\n\nUI\n\nV\n\nVEEV\n\nVRTX\n\nWAL\n\nYETI\n\n# Notes\n\nI  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments.

        "selftext": "There was a small amount of hype for this company last month, but I wanted to remind you in case you got distracted and forgot that this play is a thing, and they have earnings on the 15th. Isn't that exciting?\n\n[It has a rocket on its logo. Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/xwvfwuo4iny71.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7919da585ec69338f00f377f90a18db56919d8d)\n\nIll list some of my reasons for liking this rocket company.\n\n1. They have received the contract for NASA's first Artemis launch, as NASA begins building the necessary infrastructure for further Lunar missions. They will be putting a single cube sat into a highly technical, unique, lunar orbit launching in March of 2022. This is additionally important because it would be the first time their trademark Electron and accompanying Photon satellite bus would carry a payload to Lunar orbit. That's huge! But why? A lunar orbit has been done plenty of times before (*~~or has it?~~*), well, what if I told you the Electron rocket is one of the most cost affordable rockets available on the market at the moment. The successful launch of a NASA satellite into lunar orbit via an Electron and Photon configuration would open up lunar satellite launches to many different countries, organization's and even private citizens. Forget a lambo, I want my own moon satellite. \n2. The launch window for their next mission, *Love At First Insight,* opens on Thursday night, US time. This will be the first launch of a series of three for the same customer. With a proven track record of successful launches, I spy with my little eye no reason to believe this launch will be any different, except that it will be their first launch since IPO. Additionally, it will be their first live launch including ground experimentation with helicopter recovery.\n3. You read that right. Helicopter recovery. Let me clarify, that while they will not be recovering this booster by helicopter, they will be making a dry run at it, to investigate its possibility further, as they already have with static aerial drops. [Rocket Lab | Mid-Air Recovery Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3CWGDhkmbs) As they continue to develop this system, we could see potential that a booster could be recovered by helicopter, landed back on the launch pad to refuel and be inspected, have a new payload added and be launched again. Makes a lot more sense when you consider that Rocket Labs main launch site, the Mahia Launch Complex in New Zealand has potential for a very rapid launch cadence, and so does their Electron Rocket. \n4. Lets look at the bigger picture of what this company is. They're filling a niche market, providing solutions for launches that otherwise would not be economically feasible. They are *not* looking to be SpaceX's competition, although they could someday, if they wanted to, but at the moment, its simply not in their interest. Their Electron rockets are small, agile, and resusable, and can be tailored to almost any low earth orbit.\n5. They are currently in development of a larger rocket, Rocket Lab Neutron, which is expected to be operational by 2024 and will launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in New Zealand.\n6. I want to mention again that this upcoming launch will be their first launch since IPO, considering that a month after IPO the stock price reached a ATH of $21.34 on Sep 9th, I see it having significant potential to bounce back to these numbers as they keep pushing out more and more news. \n\nFor these reasons, I now consider RKLB to be the best aerospace play of the year, and consider a price target of $25 feasible. Ill be buying more and more while it is still on sale.",

I remember seeing [this news piece](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dillards-to-repurchase-up-to-%24500-mln-of-class-a-common-stock-2021-05-15) about Dillard's ($DDS) board approval for $500 million earlier and not thinking too much about it. I thought their YTD performance was primarily driven by a high short interest squeeze, similar to the moves in $GME and $AMC.\n\nHowever, some really smart people in the industry have been paying attention, and prominent names like David Einhorn [mentioned owning Dillard's](https://youtu.be/D8R6fFq0siI?t=2266) during the turn of events this past year. While some algo-related short interest has helped propel the stock higher, it's incredible that a $5 billion enterprise value business has only 20 million shares outstanding. \n\nSo, the question is, are other companies near this 'end game' like a snake that eats its own tail? Tickers like $KLAC, $IT, $BBWI, $CHTR, $CDNS, and $AZO are in high buyback ETFs, and have respectable-enough business models that the S&amp;P approves of.\n\nAlso, when I actually try to model out $DDS's current repurchase plan, I'm no Dexter, but I think it would take 170 years for the company to buy itself completely back (assuming constant $500 million in annual repurchases, same valuation as of today's closing price, 'flat' stock price per year, and eventually, fractional share repurchases). It would have to be modeled by day to actually see how the daily stock price fluctuates based on incremental repurchases, but the end game is the same. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gc1gs6kycax71.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5afa9067d64dcdc4089afd916a920b563ce52a10\n\nAccording to those same calculations, this repurchase plan would give 13.9% ARR (annual rate of return) for the first 10 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hha00t90dax71.png?width=907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78d98df698fde0285810f5d5a48901f368585b3c\n\nDo the flat-line assumptions make this too good to be true? Along with c-suite incentives to boost EPS and increase % control of the company, should boomer-esq companies just use FCF to repurchase instead of paying out dividends? \n\n**TLDR:** \n\n\\- Dillard's ($DDS) has bought back a lot of stock. What are the end game implications for this?\n\n\\- What other companies are nearing this buyback 'end game'?\n\n\\- Is it possible to model repurchase plans multiple years out in advance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any responses in advance. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below. My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.\n\n# Observations/Assumptions\n\nBefore you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions, not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can jump down my throat.\n\n* Companies with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies missing one or more of those attributes.\n* For most people it is impossible to time the market\n* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.\n* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.\n* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)\n* [Index fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)\n* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).\n* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)\n* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.\n* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.\n* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:\n   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp) even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in that same set of stocks in the same proportions.\n   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don\u2019t want to support.\n   * Due to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020, forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price, which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nUsing industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.\n\n# Experiment 2020\n\n750 largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index. For example, each companies\u2019 average ROE of the last 4 years was compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:\n\n* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1\n* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2\n* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3\n\nFor example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was 10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%, they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a great rating.\n\nThis was done for all of the metrics below:\n\n* ROE\n* Revenue Growth %\n* EBITDA %\n* FCF %\n\nThe relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be decreased to 125% for a better distribution.\n\nAny stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.\n\nExample below on ROE:\n\n[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/unapdml3m6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d615130616fb32c179674306cb461d3c0dcb2d)\n\nThat left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.\n\nThis left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude them?\n\nThat left 26 across 7 sectors. \n\n**2020 Industries**\n\n[2020 Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/o9llcazgm6081.png?width=386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64e5c541e836a173e373113b5d13cc5b7648f57a)\n\nThese 26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.\n\n2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\nCan we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.\n\n# Experiment 2021\n\n2,850 tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list. The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:\n\n* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company\n* Profit Margin \u2013 shows how effective the business is at making money\n* Operating Margin \u2013 shows how much money the company earns on its revenue\n* FCF Margin \u2013 shows how efficient a company is with their cash\n* EBITDA Margin \u2013 shows a companies\u2019 operating profitability\n* ROE \u2013 shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money\n* ROA \u2013 shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits\n* ROIC \u2013 shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns\n* Debt/Equity Ratio \u2013 shows the financial stability of a company\n\nMore metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:\n\n\u00b7 3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.\n\nEach stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%, Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the particular metric to find a useful distribution.\n\nI also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a score of 23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119. Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn\u2019t match the original input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet again.\n\nHere is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:\n\n[Aerospace and Defense Example Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/s80995tpo6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fbc4aa6a06985cbedd1d4bf26d678b94bcc977)\n\nHere is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company\u2019s most recent year):\n\n[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/12pnpz90p6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d32a3469e261be37cba38f28c9ca39ef0552e0)\n\nHere is an example of the visualizations for the data:\n\n[Data Visualizations](https://preview.redd.it/112baw12p6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c55275971eba7f3f0d316f84a275da53572fcf8)\n\nI applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.\n\nNext, I read the description of \\~300 stocks and looked through their financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn\u2019t interested in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it\u2019s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated \\~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I\u2019d need to build a separate model.\n\nI then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \\~75.\n\nWe were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83 companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:\n\n**Industry**\n\n[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/r9rt903pp6081.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95168c9e7c65cf548f4bd7c4be45ffaf9b1ac46b)\n\nI then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.\n\n2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Industry Classification\n\n* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.\n   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.\n   * This seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other that aren\u2019t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.\n* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.\n   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.\n   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).\n   * I ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10 stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such as biotech and pharmaceutical.\n\n# 2020 Stocks\n\nABMD\n\nADBE\n\nANET\n\nBWXT\n\nCRL\n\nDG\n\nENR\n\nETSY\n\nEXEL\n\nICLR\n\nISRG\n\nKLAC\n\nLKQ\n\nLRCX\n\nMNST\n\nMPWR\n\nMTCH\n\nOLED\n\nPAYC\n\nPHM\n\nTER\n\nTTD\n\nUI\n\nVEEV\n\nVMW\n\nVRTX\n\n# 2021 Stocks\n\nAAON\n\nAAPL\n\nACN\n\nADBE\n\nAEIS\n\nALGN\n\nAMAT\n\nANET\n\nAPH\n\nATR\n\nATVI\n\nAX\n\nBLD\n\nCDNS\n\nCGNX\n\nCHD\n\nCHE\n\nCORT\n\nCPRT\n\nDLB\n\nDORM\n\nEPAM\n\nESNT\n\nETSY\n\nEW\n\nEXPD\n\nEXPO\n\nFAST\n\nFB\n\nFIX\n\nFOXF\n\nFTNT\n\nGGG\n\nGOOG\n\nGRMN\n\nHEI.A\n\nHELE\n\nIDA\n\nINS\n\nINTC\n\nINTU\n\nIRBT\n\nISRG\n\nCCSI\n\nZD\n\nKLAC\n\nLRCX\n\nLULU\n\nMASI\n\nMED\n\nMKSI\n\nMKTX\n\nMNST\n\nMORN\n\nMPWR\n\nMSFT\n\nNMIH\n\nNRC\n\nNVDA\n\nODFL\n\nOLED\n\nOLLI\n\nPAYC\n\nPAYX\n\nPRLB\n\nQLYS\n\nREGN\n\nRMR\n\nROAD\n\nSCCO\n\nSFBS\n\nSLP\n\nSTMP\n\nTDY\n\nTER\n\nTREX\n\nTROW\n\nTTD\n\nTYL\n\nUI\n\nV\n\nVEEV\n\nVRTX\n\nWAL\n\nYETI\n\n# Notes\n\nI partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKBM7mR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $166.81\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

        "selftext": "**The Companies** \nMAXN - Maxeon is a spin off from SunPower that focuses only on manufacturing solar panels.\n\nSPWR - SunPower is a solar solution provider and installer, that is primarily focused on the service installation and operation of solar solutions. Prior to October 2020, SPWR made their own solar panels. After October 2020, MAXN makes the solar panels and is owned as a partnership of TZS, SPWR and Total.\n\nENPH - Enphase makes batteries, microinverters and software that is used to convert the energy generated by solar panels into usable electricity for your home.\n\n**The Relationships**\n\nSPWR used to manufacture their own panels, but then spun off MAXN so they can have two lines of business with different expenses and revenue streams. ENPH partners with MAXN and SPWR to integrate microinverters into solar panels: https://enphase.com/installers/acm/sunpower\n\nMAXN is primarily sold and installed by SPWR. So if SPWR has a bad quarter, expect MAXN to hurt. And similarly, ENPH is a canary in a coal mine. When ENPH has bad news, it will take MAXN and SPWR with them.\n\n**Historical performance**\n\nBack in April, MAXN put out an awful Q1 and lowered year long estimates. They also coupled this by putting out an offering redeemable at $18. Overall, it was a triple beatdown that saw MAXN drop from $40 to $15. Also, during that drop, there were regular price cuts by Raymond James, a bullish analyst.\n\nIn Q3, we have a real interesting mix of sentiment. SPWR had a bad quarter with earnings despite revenue being up. This hurt the stock price by 8%. MAXN had a sympathy slide of about 15% in reaction. ENPH on the other hand blew out investor expectations and jumped 25% and is holding strong.\n\nMAXN in Q2: https://corp.maxeon.com/static-files/16f85525-3954-42f9-9109-b8e4d5003af2\n\nRevenue was only up 5% both QoQ and YoY for Q2.\n\n**Projections and Valuation**\n\nMAXN has Q3 revenue projections of $220M, which is 20% higher than their Q2 revenue of $175. SPWR was targeted for $329M in revenue but only hit $323M.\n\nIf MAXN hits $220M, and closes the year at $700M in revenue, their P/S ratio would be 1.35. Both CSIQ and JKS operate at P/S ratios of 0.55. SEDG operates at a P/S of 10, but SEDG offers more products in a higher margin space.\n\nI think unless MAXN blows it out of the water, we can expect a price slide back to $18.\n\n**The company catalysts**\n\nThe biggest bet on MAXN is the end of the polysilicon contract that they current have which was obtained above market:\nhttps://stockspinoffinvesting.com/spin-offs/maxeon-solar-technologies-deep-dive/\n\nThe catalyst for MAXN is that the contract for their above market polysilicon supply is going to expire in 2022. Using their Q2 numbers (https://corp.maxeon.com/static-files/16f85525-3954-42f9-9109-b8e4d5003af2) We can see that MAXN has an additional expense of $12M in Q2 because of above market polysilicon. This means that once the contract ends, they will immediately have $12M in savings, which is about 10% of their current revenue per quarter. Unfortunately, this $12M doesn't make them profitable, but it decreases their operating loss by almost 25%. It doesn't affect their P/S ratios, but it helps their EPS and cash flows, which could give them some runway.\n\nOverall, I think MAXN is going to provide middling numbers and coupled with SPWR's lower results, the polysilicon offset won't be enough to pump MAXN beyond $25.",

The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmulEWE-T6Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TSN $OEG $OTLY $AAP $IDEX $CSPR $WMT $HD $SE $STNE $LZB $DLO $TGT $BIDU $LOW $TJX $BILI $NNOX $NVDA $CSCO $VSCO $BABA $JD $M $BJ $WOOF $AMAT $WDAY $INTU $PANW $WSM $FL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MrpShLB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmulEWE-T6Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TSN $OEG $OTLY $AAP $IDEX $CSPR $WMT $HD $SE $STNE $LZB $DLO $TGT $BIDU $LOW $TJX $BILI $NNOX $NVDA $CSCO $VSCO $BABA $JD $M $BJ $WOOF $AMAT $WDAY $INTU $PANW $WSM $FL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MrpShLB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September.

Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%.

Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKBM7mR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $166.81\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Perhaps China but that's not included in IWDA anyways. \n\nMeanwhile VUSA has performend better and also has a cheaper TER (0,05%). \n\n\n- Am i missing something or is VUSA the better deal here? \n\n- I know IWDA has around 1500 companies and VUSA only 500 but that's still a pretty good diversification right?",
