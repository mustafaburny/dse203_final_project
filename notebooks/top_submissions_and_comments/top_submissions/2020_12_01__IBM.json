        "selftext": "Note: if you just want the code, there is a link to the GitHub repository at the bottom of the post \ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Introduction** \n-\n\nHello my autistic friends,\n\nI'll keep this short because I know you are all essentially illiterate. I come to you today after countless days of FOMO-ing the top, and panic selling the bottom. Paper hands is a *DISEASE* that plagues many of us, and I am no stranger to it. One day, I decided that I'm simply too fucking retarded to remove my emotions from trading entirely, and so I decided to try to get my computer to do it for me. I think I was pretty successful, but you can judge for yourself. If you want, you can download the code and try out my algorithm, or you can easily design and test your own!\n\n**The Algorithm**\n-\nThe algorithm is tested on the past 3 years of close prices for a particular stock. It does not have any information about the dataset beyond the current point (i.e. I made sure it doesn't cheat by looking into the future). The algorithm starts with 100 shares of the stock, and then each day either decides to Buy, Sell, or Hold. The returns generated by the algorithm are compared to those generated by a simple buy-and-hold from the start. The results are shown below, check out those sexy graphs:\n\n--\n**Results**\n--\n-\nTicker: [BABA](https://imgur.com/TwOShiK)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$17140.42\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$19274.65\n\n******\nTicker: [IBM](https://imgur.com/lhWY5yX)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: -$1,376.32\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$403.09\n\n******\nTicker: [PEN](https://imgur.com/B4myQ0t)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$11,794.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$13,176.74\n\n******\nTicker: [GOOG](https://imgur.com/wl01kRr)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$94,486.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$82,392.37\n\n******\nTicker: [SPCE](https://imgur.com/mrIUnX1)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$1,373.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$1612.49\n\n---\n\nAs you can see, most of the time the algorithm is successful. It out performed Buy-and-Hold for ~80% of the tickers that I tried it on. And I think one of the best indicators of success is that it made money even when IBM went down over the last 3 years. However it is far from perfect, because the weights/thresholds that the algorithm uses seem to stop working for lower priced stocks. (For example the algo has trouble with tickers like GE). More work is needed to generalize to algorithm to handle a broad range of tickers.\n\nThis is where you come in hopefully. I urge you all to fork the repository and download the code and try it out for yourself. Feel free to make changes and modify the algorithm and submit a pull request on GitHub. The goal here is to generalize the algorithm so that it out performs Buy-and-Hold across the market. \n\nI have set up the script in such a way so that all you need to modify is the Decide() method to create and test your own algorithm. My algorithm uses various moving averages and their derivatives to make decisions. Those moving average functions and their slope/concavity/etc are calculated for each iteration and made available for the user to use in the Decide() method to design their own algorithm. \n\n**Download the Code** \n-\n[Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ryantcullen/stock-bot)\n\nPlease fork the repository and submit a pull request if you see something you want to add/change. (and if you could drop a star on the repo, my job searching quest would greatly appreciate it) \n\nIf you have a broker that lets you use algorithmic trading, you are probably smart enough to adapt this code to their API, but feel free to let me know if you have any questions.\n\nGod speed retards \ud83d\ude4f I hope I can help you guys make some money.",

        "selftext": " Just saw a great DD article on Seeking Alpha on PLTR. https://seeking$$alpha.com/article/4392215-palantir-technologies-in-depth-look-whether-sustainable-competitive-advantage\n\nIt's paywalled so here's the text to share. I know most of you autists can't read for shit, BUT GODDAMN READ THIS SHIT SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON. or just read the summary, or scroll to the very bottom for TL;DR \n\n**Summary**\n\n* As speculators circle around Palantir from both the long and short sides, trading volatility has obscured the fundamental picture as to whether the company commands a sustainable competitive advantage.\n* In this article, I intend to have an under-the-hood look at Palantir as a 'digital resources' play to answer that all-important question.\n* I believe its Gotham, bundled with forward-deployed field service representatives, has surmounted the barriers to entry and now enjoys switching cost advantage and emerging network effect.\n* As it diversifies into adjacent commercial verticals through Foundry, Palantir will benefit from economies of scope and scale. Profits will ensue.\n* Shareholders are betting on Palantir's success in completing the digging of a wide moat. The less anticipatory investors may want to wait until such a moat becomes reality.\n\n**Palantir Technologies: Does It Have A Sustainable Competitive Advantage?**\n\nThere are probably as many investors who are averse to Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), a recent public listing, as those who root for it. The stock has gone parabolic since the start of November 2020. Then, short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research entered the scene with his tweet. All of the trading volatility has obscured one important fundamental question: does Palantir have a sustainable competitive advantage?\n\nBelow, I attempt to answer that question with an in-depth look at this interesting company.\n\n**What does Palantir do?**\n\nAs of 2020, Palantir's mission is to help its users, the people doing the hard work on complex, real-world problems by writing software that enables effective analysis against complicated, data-driven problems.\n\nPalantir offers two principal data fusion platforms for integrating, managing, and securing any kind of data at a massive scale, i.e., Gotham for government agencies and Foundry for the commercial market. With forwarded-deployed Field Service Representatives, Palantir transforms massive amounts of disparate information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations, and layer applications on top of the Gotham or Foundry platform to make the integrated data asset accessible and actionable and for fully interactive, human-driven, machine-assisted analysis (Fig. 1).\n\nOn the backend, Palantir runs a system called Apollo as a continuous, automated means to deliver updates to the Foundry and Gotham platforms everywhere they are deployed - cloud, on-premises, and classified networks - without disrupting customer operations. Apollo reduces the demand for field engineering teams to manage software deployments and gives Palantir SaaS operating efficiency in a very heterogeneous environment.\n\nLooking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires not only to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.\n\nThere is a range of potential competitors that offer similar services in some capacity, including (1) traditional IT consultancies, e.g., Booz Allen (BAH) and Accenture (ACN), which lack the technical prowess as well as niche focus; (2) blue-chip data companies, e.g., IBM/i2 (IBM), which cannot scale down efficiently enough to compete on price; and (3) defense contractors such as Booz Allen (BAH), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), and BAE Systems plc (OTCPK:BAESF), which cannot compete on costs and end-user responsiveness with Palantir. These juggernauts are not nimble enough to pivot away from their legacies and wide-ranging service offerings to effectively match the focus and end-user friendliness of Palantir, although they may occasionally chip away some revenue.\n\nSilicon Valley heavyweights, such as Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), are unwilling to work for the Pentagon citing unethically even though it thought it was okay to collaborate with the Chinese government in project Dragonfly (see here).\n\nThere are some smaller start-ups that work in the same general field as Palantir, but they lack the resources (capital and talent) to climb the steep learning curve and compete against Palantir head-to-head. These may include Digital Reasoning, which entered the intelligence field even before Palantir and also received funding from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm of the CIA, which seems not to be particularly well run which is why its founder recently returned to the CEO helms; (2) Ayasdi, acquired by the SymphonyAI Group in 2019, which has a core topological analysis platform on top of which custom applications for customers mostly in healthcare and finance are built; and Beijing-based MiningLamp, self-styling as \"the Palantir of China\" and with US$300 million just raised in a funding round co-led by Temasek and Tencent, which may pose some threat in the commercial arena given it reportedly got business from western firms (see here).\n\nWith regard to the OS platform for data especially on the government front, Palantir more or less owns the niche. On the commercial front, Palantir is industry agnostic but is focused on forging ties with approximately 6,000 companies in the world with more than $500 million in annual revenue. Palantir has been saying the real competition is the in-house development projects of its potential customers.\n\n**The digital resources space**\n\nI believe some of the key characteristics of Palantir can be better understood in the context of what I call the \"digital resources\" investment space at The Natural Resources Hub (Table 1). This is a group of businesses from various industries, which in a nutshell share the following features:\n\nA unique value proposition. By accumulating and processing big data, or enabling data-intensive operations, these B2B companies generate recurring, subscription-based revenue from business or government customers.\n\nWide moat. They command a monopolistic or oligarchic position in their niche, protected by enormous barriers to entry, some network effects, and switching costs, which gives them a sustainable competitive advantage over the fellow industry participants they serve. They tend to show resilience during industry crises.\n\nDominance in native industry. They are deeply entrenched in their respective native industries. Some of them were even bankrolled at their birth by home industry advocacy groups. They then expand into adjacent industries in pursuit of economies of scope.\n\nAggressive acquisitions. In an expansion of their service into adjacent verticals, they usually face a fragmented competitive landscape, fertile for M&amp;A, which further fuels rapid growth.\n\nCapital and operational efficiency. They develop scalable solutions that are built once and installable or sellable countless times. So, they are capital-light and can operate very efficiently. They typically generate superior profitability and deliver a high rate of returns on invested capital.\n\nAs I shall demonstrate below, Palantir shares most, if not all, of the characteristics of the verified members of the 'digital resources\" space. Prima facie, it is a wide moat prospect and worth a deeper examination.\n\n**Does Palantir have a sustainable competitive advantage?**\n\nIn the consumer-oriented internet arena, winners are known to take all thanks to a number of traits, including the economies of scale and scope, network effects, the advantage of big data and machine learning, brand power, switching costs, the attraction of talents, the charisma of hard-driving founders, and benefits of geographical clustering, as has been summarized here.\n\nThe same may not be said about the B2B platform race, where peers compete mainly on products, services, and customer experience (see here). The outcome of the competition may not be binary (the winner takes all, and the losers die) due to the lack of viral growth.\n\n**The technological edge**\n\nAs I stated above, B2B platform rivals compete primarily on products, services, and customer experience. Palantir follows the approach of bundling superior technology with top-notch forward-deployed field service representatives.\n\nIn its home industry - intelligence and defense, Gotham was created with native attention to security rules, access privilege, and user action logging. No other systems allow users to draw associations between disparate data sets and to visualize the connections as easily and quickly. Palantir has maintained a laser-sharp focus on developing the world's best platform for data, while its primary competitors such as Booz Allen or Raytheon are widely diversified. From competition outcome to reputation among end-users, Palantir not only has a clear technological edge but also is more cost-effective than competitors (see here and here). That's why Palantir is confident it only needs to be placed in front of the right people to prove its worth.\n\nBut then, what makes Gotham shine are the forward-deployed field service representatives. Palantir field service representatives proved to be not only some of the brightest engineers known to government agencies but also extremely responsive to the needs of end-users. These forwarded-deployed engineers examine customer needs, resolve all data source and complexity issues, and build out applications on top of Gotham. Once the applications are built, they train users on site until the customers are ready to use the product on their own. The forwarded-deployed engineers also bring their experience acquired in the reality of deployment back to Palantir development centers as they rotate assignments.\n\nAlthough its technology and approach are by no means cannot be replicated, Palantir makes the smart decision of focusing on a narrow scope in the sprawling B2B data landscape and, in that niche, it excels at helping customers solving complex data problems at relatively low costs, which actually takes a lot to accomplish, from well-written software, via responsive backend support, to knowledgeable forward-deployed field service representatives. It is no wonder Palantir has earned a sterling reputation for effectiveness and ease of use in the intelligence and defense circle, which I believe it can parlay into the commercial market (Fig. 2).\n\n**Palantir brand and talent attraction**\n\nGiven the forwarded-deployed engineers play such an important role in the technological advantage of Palantir (as do the backend developers), it follows that it is critical for it to attract the smartest engineers in the market if that edge is to be maintained and expanded. To that end, the founders have successfully created an aura of mystery around Palantir:\n\nIn-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm of the CIA, being its very first investor; catcher of Osama bin Laden and the would-be preventer of 9/11; buster of the hacker of Dalai Lama's personal computer and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff;\n\nsoftware vendor to a slew of U.S. intelligence and military agencies (including the CIA, FBI, DHS, NSA, Special Operations, the Marine Corps, the U.S. Army and West Point, the U.S. Navy, the USAF, and the U.S. Space Force), police departments like NYPD, the governments of U.S. allies, and commercial businesses Ferrari (RACE), Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), BP (BP), Merck (MRK), and JP Morgan (JPM);\n\nhelper of the NIH, CDC, and NHS to track the COVID-19 virus, the World Food Program to stop famine, and the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children to fight child exploitation;\n\nhigh-profile politicians such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet advising, while luminaries Mike Kelly, David MacNaughton, Louis Mosley (grandson of Oswald Mosley), and Fabrice Br\u00e9gier (former No. 2 at Airbus) joining to lead its Australian, Canadian, British, and French subsidiaries, respectively;\n\na dissent in Silicon Valley that takes side with the U.S.A.; let alone the persona of the hard-driving founders, including Peter Thiel who is said to be the smartest guy in the Silicon Valley besides being a co-founder of PayPal (EBAY) and the first outside investor in Facebook (FB), the lawyer-philosopher-hedge fund manager CEO Alex Karp, and the genius engineers Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Nathan Gettings; even Shyam Shankar, the COO, has also been getting a lot of attention...\n\nThe mystique proves to be a powerful recruiting advantage; it helps line up a self-replenishing stream of the best applicants from some of the top-ranked colleges and graduate schools, who are confident they are the smartest computer geeks, who join to work long hours with a cultish band of fellow geniuses to solve the world's hardest problems in spite of lower salaries than Silicon Valley juggernauts like Google, Facebook, and Apple (AAPL).\n\nBecoming a publicly-traded company only strengthens the staffing edge, thus posing a serious challenge for the big IT consultancies, traditional defense contractors, and smaller start-ups. Hiring the best talents will undoubtedly help sustain Palantir's technological advantage.\n\n**High barriers to entry**\n\nThere exist extremely high barriers to entry in the intelligence and defense sector. Even the best end-user experience and reputation alone are not enough to get deals closed. Below, I highlight two hurdles.\n\nJust to open doors. To open doors and lubricate negotiations, some major defense contractors spend as much as $14 million per year on lobbying.\n\nPalantir had been quick in learning the rope of getting things done in Washington D.C. It consulted Washington insiders early on and went ahead hiring former senators John Braux and Trent Lott for formal lobbying (see here). Its lobbying spending has been on a steady rise and, in the last few years, reached well over $1 million per year by hiring &gt;25 lobbyists (Fig. 3).\n\nPalantir also retained former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet as advisers (see here).\n\nTo overcome buyer inertia gently and forcefully. Another major challenge faced by Palantir was the department of defense saw it as an outsider that tries to sell software not even in response to any specific requests in its conventional acquisition system, oblivious to the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of Palantir Gotham.\n\nIn response, Palantir allowed free trials of Gotham and provided free services before potential military clients made any purchases; it offered free or reduced-price training to military units that purchased its software. Forward-deployed field service representatives listened to the needs of its end-users and were capable of implementing requested changes quickly.\n\nPalantir's entrepreneurial approach led to a number of successes with, e.g., some Army military intelligence units and the Marine Corps. Some intelligence officials in the Marine Corps even went so far as to say they would not be surprised to see Palantir remain the de facto standard (see here).\n\nEven though Palantir has demonstrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Gotham, the U.S. Army stuck to the plan of developing its internal intelligence software suite, i.e., the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Increment 2, and released a procurement solicitation in December 2015 for its development, thus effectively excluding the ready-to-deploy commercial alternative - Gotham - from being considered. The Army decision was a major blow to Palantir because Gotham does exactly what DCGS-A is trying to do yet at a much lower cost; in other words, the Army is reinventing the wheel, unnecessarily and wastefully.\n\nAfter a pre-award bid protest filed with the Government Accountability Office had been denied, Palantir sued the Army in the Court of Federal Claims in June 2016, arguing the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act by not conducting the market research necessary to determine if commercially available items could meet its needs, with or without modification. The lawsuit is an extremely bold move because defense contractors typically dared not to sue its largest customer, even when their interest as protected by the 1994 law had been infringed. The judge ruled in favor of Palantir in October 2016 and upheld Palantir\u2019s argument the Army violated the 1994 law (see here), which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on September 7, 2018.\n\nEven while the appeal was ongoing, the Army rethought its acquisition plan and, in March 2018, picked Raytheon and Palantir to provide new intelligence analysis platform offerings that could be used effectively at the tactical level in place of DGCS-A. In March 2019, the Army announced Gotham beat out Raytheon's FoXTEN system and won the $20 million first delivery order, as part of an $876 million contract over 10 years. Significantly, the Army's loss in court forced it to transform its procurement process. The Army now follows a \u201ctry, buy, decide approach\u201d when it comes to commercially available products (see here). The win in the court is expected to create a lot of opportunities for Palantir down the road.\n\nThe distance Palantir has gone to gain access to the intelligence and military market proves one thing: the presence of enormous barriers to entry. In the face of such formidable hurdles, few aspirants have the determination, investment time horizon, and resources to pull off the feat of entering and establishing itself as the de facto standard in that market. Over a time span of 15+ years, Palantir sunk quite a few billions of VC dollars on software development, offering products and services for free or on lean fees, and lobbying and suing to get a level playing field, yet without a single major botch-up over all those years. Those who sneer at Palantir for still losing money after 17 years of investment fail to appreciate how impossible a strategic goal the company has come to set for itself: to become a wide-moat software supplier to the governments of the U.S. and its allies.\n\n**Switching cost, economies of scale, and network effect**\n\nHaving earned contracts from the intelligence and defense sector, Palantir became an insider so to speak, and the barriers to entry work to its advantage. Gotham has been deployed as the platform for data integration at various intelligence and military units displacing the existing system including DGCS-A, a myriad of applications has been developed for the agents, and thousands of end-users have been trained to use those applications on a tactical level in critical missions and battlefields. A switching cost has arisen in favor of Palantir and it will only get higher.\n\nAs more contracts are signed with the U.S. government and its allies, Palantir will begin to enjoy economies of scale, thanks to the large fixed costs incurred for building the software once and the relatively low costs associated with deploying it countless times.\n\nJust playing out according to Palantir's plan, Gotham is increasingly being used for sharing disparate data sets across different government agencies. Once those siloed data sets are all integrated on Gotham, there will emerge a huge network effect, further heightening the existing barriers to entry. Under such a network effect, a new entrant may land an isolated deal sporadically, but it is beyond me how this hypothetical incursor can dislodge Palantir by convincing dozens of stodgy government agencies to simultaneously give up perfectly-functional, mission-critical Gotham and install an unproven piece of software instead. That's why I believe Palantir's competitive advantage in the government sector will prove to be sustainable.\n\n**The commercial market**\n\nAs I discussed above, 'digital resources' companies tend to expand into adjacent verticals for the benefit of economies of scope. Palantir's expansion into various industries in the commercial sector is precisely for that end. The same technological know-how sharpened in defense deployments can be parlayed into serving the commercial sector. The utilization of Apollo, the backend system for continuous, automated software update deployment, doubles as it supports Foundry in addition to Gotham. The corporate resources are shared by operations in both sectors, resulting in lower overhead per dollar of revenue. The direct sales force will be able to cross-sell Gotham to some commercial customers. Diversification into additional industries reduces the risk associated with the slowdown of individual industries. As opposed to the high barriers to entry in its home industry of intelligence and defense, the commercial world tends to have more competitors. However, economies of scope will likely offset the narrower moat.\n\n**Network effect in the commercial sector**\n\nOver the long term, Palantir (PLTR) estimates the total addressable commercial market contains \\~6,000 companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue (see here). Palantir began to develop Foundry for the commercial sector in 2012 and launched it in 2016. Foundry is poised to become a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries. In 2017, e.g., the five-year, $300 million partnership with Airbus allowed Foundry to expand into a platform for the aviation industry, which today connects data from &gt;100 airlines and 9,000 aircraft around the world.\n\nIf successful, an industry-wide central operating system for data will effectuate an extensive network effect. However, to get there, Palantir needs to rapidly grow the commercial top-line. Foundry pulled in $340 million in 2018 and $397 million in 2019. Commercial revenue grew 35% from the 3Q2019 to the same period one year ago (see here). How will Palantir further accelerate commercial sales momentum?\n\n**Commercial sales strategies to accelerate the network effect**\n\nIn the near term, Palantir plans to focus on building partnerships with institutions that have the leadership necessary to effect structural change within their organizations - to reconstitute their operations around data. Buy-in from the top brass is imperative. Hopefully, Palantir can leverage its reputation and relationships gained in the government sector, as in an early case in which NYPD, then a customer, introduced Palantir to its first commercial client JP Morgan (JPM).\n\nPalantir used to have a policy of not hiring direct salespeople, given how intelligence and military contracts are acquired and serviced and perhaps due to a post-dotcom bubble belief \"technology is primarily about product development, not distribution\". However, there is absolutely no viral growth in B2B as there occasionally is in B2C. The common practice in the 'digital resources' space is to maintain a large force of salespeople each managing a few customer accounts, with responsibilities such as opening new sales territory, scouting for client needs, scaling within existing customer accounts, coordinating technical presentations by engineers, securing technical support for clients, and managing customer relationships. Palantir began to recruit direct salespeople in end-2018. The commercial sales growth in 2019 seems to prove the concept of direct sales works, so Palantir is poised to triple the headcount of the sales force.\n\nHistorically, data-inundated organizations either build in-house or buy dozens of off-the-shelf products and sew them together, both approaches having been proven inefficacious in a rapidly changing and increasingly uncertain world. Foundry offers the third, and better, option for those organizations. However, Palantir comes to realize that, in the near-term, institutions do have an imperative to stick to their internally-built software. So, Palantir makes its own solutions fully modular such that customers can \"take what they need, build on what they have\" (see here). Such a flexible approach should help overcome corporate inertia to reach out for external assistance and accelerate customer onboarding, and create a new way of going to market with channel partners.\n\nPalantir plans to partner with cloud-hosting channel partners, such as Amazon (AMZN), to drive commercial revenue growth. It was Amazon that helped facilitate the partnership between Palantir and the Colombian government. Palantir developed Visor COVID-19, a digital instrument built on top of Foundry hosted in the AWS infrastructure and offering a unified, near real-time view of the state of the pandemic using the largest integration of open data and depersonalized epidemiological data in Colombia.\n\nInternational sales already account for fo 46% of the total revenue as of the 3Q2020. As part of its international growth plan, Palantir has set up subsidiaries in Canada, Australia, the U.K., France, and other countries in the last few years. In Japan, it took a different approach and chose to form a joint venture in partnership with Sompo Holdings, Inc., which subsequently invested $500 million in Palantir. The JV launched in June 2020 \u201cthe real data platform for security, health, and wellbeing\u201d, powered by Foundry, to accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese governmental institutions and industries ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing. The JV is also working on onboarding the Japanese government.\n\n**Risk abounds**\n\nPublic relation disasters can damage its image in the eyes of the next generation of software engineers; this is an area that Palantir, now a public company, should allocate additional resources to. A Snowden-like incident can set Palantir back appreciably, impacting client relationships and employee morale alike.\n\nPalantir must penetrate its chosen market swiftly to enlarge the switching cost, expand the network effect, and heighten barriers to entry, lest a resourceful competitor launches a dogged challenge in the government sector or its smaller imitators strike it lucky in the commercial market and steal potential customers. A well-intended acquisition can turn sour, contaminating the entire operation.\n\nAs far as I can see, the management team at Palantir is paranoid enough to allow any blind spots unaddressed in its business execution. However, Black swans do happen.\n\n**Investor takeaways**\n\nI believe Palantir has an inchoate durable competitive advantage, which acts as an economic moat to protect its business from invaders, which seems to be widening judging from new developments since the IPO.\n\nIn the self-created niche of supplying the operating systems for data for government agencies, Palantir clearly delivers a peerless customer experience with superior technology bundled with top-notch forward-deployed field service representatives.\n\nGotham has become the default operating system for data at some U.S. government agencies, where Palantir enjoys switching costs.\n\nPalantir seems to have also built a brand that helps attract top-notch talents, which sustains its technological edge.\n\nNow that it has kicked open the door of the U.S. government agencies by winning a critical lawsuit against the Army, Palantir is expected to achieve rapid penetration of that market. Gotham is increasingly being used for integrating siloed data sets across different government agencies, which in time will result in an enormous network effect, further heightening the barriers to entry for aspirant entrants.\n\nThe company is aggressively diversifying into adjacent commercial verticals and international markets for economies of scope. Revenue growth, both from the government and commercial sectors, will lead to economies of scale. Down the road, Palantir will have the pricing power at its disposal to drive profitability.\n\nAt this time, the share price of Palantir may seem to have gotten ahead of itself - a point to be further explored elsewhere. The shareholders are taking risks to bet that the company will succeed in digging the wide moat and that years of profitable growth will follow.\n\nLess anticipatory investors may want to wait until Palantir has completed building such a wide moat. For these investors, the entry opportunity may come in the form of a major sell-off during a general market recession or in an idiosyncratic crisis down the road.\n\n**TL;DR - PLTR has great prospects, short-term casino, long term (8-12 months) to the moon**\n\nPositions: some shares of PLTR, some 12/4 $30 puts (hedge) at 50% gainz.",

The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze. \n\nBut this is not the point of the post today. Today I am here to convince you why a cost basis of 20 or 25 doesn't matter for PLTR. You are buying buying the company at around 40-50x 2020E sales, Which seems quite high  (not as much compared to SNOW and some other big data plays) but still. So why bother with PLTR?\n\nBefore I proceed, I know most people who read my posts can't read, and I am going to be dropping a gigantic wall of text, so here is the short form  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddzg718of5861.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b39c19f793dee8366fc2bafbc55bfe49d49836\n\nThis was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017\n\n[https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)  \n\nI started by looking at the S&amp;P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today\u2019s technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.\n\nThere is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if\u00a0the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.\n\nI agree with Peter Thiel\u2019s thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the \u201cworld of stuff\u201d. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched \u00a0out like a tree and\u00a0built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed \u00a0into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.\n\nSo I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.\n\n**Information Technology Cycles**\n\nThe following is my attempt at\u00a0describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.\n\nElectronic Age  \n**Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace\u00a0physical labor.  \n(Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)\n\n**Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.  \n(Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)\n\n**Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.  \n(Important companies: AT&amp;T, NBC, IBM)\n\nComputing/Software Age  \n**Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace\u00a0\u00a0basic mental labor.  \n(Important companies: IBM)\n\n**From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.  \n(Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)\n\n**Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.  \n(Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)\n\nCloud/AI Age  \n**Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.  \n(Candidate Important companies**:** AWS, Microsoft,\u00a0Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)\n\n**Specialized AI\u00a0(2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing\u00a0the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies\u00a0and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various\u00a0parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.  \n(Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)\n\n**General AI (2075-2100):**\u00a0Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.\n\nThe average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.\n\nThe initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:\n\nIn the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.\n\nThe proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).\n\nThe consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.\n\nWhat it means today,\n\nI would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal\u00a0increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.\n\n**From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.\n\nIt is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting\u00a0segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.\n\n2020 Update:\n\nIf we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever.  \n\nI have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above s is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.  Also  to assuage of rumors, I am not Peter Thiel or Mike Green.\n\nPosition Update;  \nNow have $220k in shares  (bought another \\~$90k in shares yesterday, still about 30k (down from 50k) in calls. I fully expect to lose all my call value.  If it drops to 20, I'll add another 100k. These shares are long term holds and are the ones to pass down to your children.",

        "selftext": "Gooday fellow SPAC investors. One thing that I noticed in this sub is that there are a lot of SPACs being mentioned that are significantly over NAV. For more conservative investors, there may be too much downside risk for these stocks, so I wanted to mention a couple of SPACs that are close to NAV and that I think have potential.  There is significantly less downside risk here and the management teams backing these SPACs appear to be competent. These are just my thoughts and I am by no means an expert in this, so I am hoping to hear what sort of cons or concerns you may have with any of these companies. Without further ado, here is my analysis:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**H.I.G. Acquisition Corp. - HIGA** \\- $10.06/share \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why I invested:** The stock is currently sitting very close to NAV. While the management team is not hyper focused on a single industry like some other SPACs that I am listing, there is a solid leadership team of former executives across multiple industries that have all touched technology in some way. Sidney Taurel was instrumental in Eli Lily\u2019s growth and combined with the experience of the other executives, I think that the team could effectively find a deal in the technology industry. While it is too early to tell where this will go, a near NAV price seems too attractive at this point given the track record of the management team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IPO Size:** $364M\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSidney Taurel \n\n* Chairman Pearson plc (Publishing and education)\n* Fmr CEO, Eli Lily (Pharmaceutical)\n* Director, IBM\n* Strategy advisor, Almirall S.A. (Pharmaceutical)\n\nWilliam Mitchell \n\n* Director, Veritiv &amp; Humana (Capital)\n* Lead independent director, Rogers Corporation (Electrical &amp; Electronic Manufacturing)\n* Former CEO, Arrow Electronics (Information Technology)\n* Former CEO, Global Lifecycle EMEA (Information Technology)\n\nChristopher O\u2019Connell\n\n* CEO, Waters Corporation (Analytical technologies for life science, food &amp; environmental and industrial customers)\n\nBrian Schwartz\n\n* Co-President of H.I.G. Capital (Leading global alternative asset manager)\n* Former Strategic planning group, PepsiCo\n\n**Target:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Company plans to leverage HIG\u2019s deal-sourcing network, which has investment experience in the **healthcare, technology, media and telecommunications, services, industrial, consumer and other sectors**\n\nDefensible businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and differentiated value proposition that operate in attractive, secularly growing markets, have unrealized strategic and operational upsides, and are well suited for public markets\n\n**Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp. - CRHC** \\- $10.14/share\n\n**Why I invested:** CRHC is looking into acquiring a technology, software or fintech company. Gary will certainly have insight into Fintech from his experience at Goldman Sachs and from my research, has been very active on the boards of many startup companies. I am speculating that the acquisition here may be in the blockchain Fintech space. With an initial IPO of over $800M, the opportunities here seem diverse. \n\n**IPO Size:** $828M\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGary Cohn \n\n* Former President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, and director, Goldman Sachs\n* Former Director of the National Economic Council and chief economic advisor to President Donald Trump\n* Board of Hoyos Integrity (startup company employing biometric blockchain technology for secure communications and digital payments)\n* Board of Spring Labs, a startup using blockchain technology to share consumer credit data\n* Key advisor for Machine Zone\\[41\\] and Abryx, a biomaterial science company\n\nClifton Robbins\n\n* CEO, Blue Harbour Group (Capital)\n* pioneering two innovations: conducting shareholder activism exclusively on a collaborative basis, an approach that became known as \u201cfriendly activism\u201d, and being among the first active equity managers to fully integrate ESG (environmental, social and governance)\n\n**Target:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom prospectus: \u201cWhile our founders have expertise and experience investing across virtually all industries and sectors and we may pursue an acquisition in any business industry or sector, we believe there are attractive trends in several particular industries where we have expertise, including **consumer and, within the technology sector, software and fintech**. We intend to target large, private equity and venture capital-owned assets, founder-led businesses and corporate carve-outs where our insights, expertise and networks can provide advantaged solutions to create value, including through add-on acquisitions, governance enhancements, capital structure optimization, improvements to operations and risk management (including material environmental, social and governance, or \u201cESG\u201d, practices and metrics) and attracting and expanding institutional following and ownership.\u201d\n\n**Peridot Acquisition Corp. - PDAC** \\- $10.14/share\n\n**Why I invested:** The company management here is stacked with multiple people with frontline industry experience leading energy companies and companies that specialize in investing in energy. I strongly expect that PDAC will find a suitable target based on management\u2019s past track record. The prospect of acquiring an environmentally friendly company in the current environmental boom environment makes me feel like this company could be a mooner. \n\n**IPO Size:$300M**\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlan Levande \n\n* Former Co-CEO of Covey Park Energy (Natural Gas)\n* Co-Founder Tenaska Capital Management LLC (Energy Investments)\n\nScott Prochazka \n\n* Former CEO of CenterPoint Energy (Energy Delivery)\n\nJonathan Silver \n\n* Director, Plug Power, National Grid, \n* Former Exec. Director of Loan Programs under Pres. Obama\n* Recognized as one of the United States\u2019 Top 10 Green Tech Influencers\n\nTomas Ackerman\n\n* Co-Founder of Carnelian Investments (Energy Investments)\n\nDr. Varun Sivaram\n\n* Chief Technology Officer of ReNew Power Limited (India\u2019s largest renewable energy firm)\n\n**Target:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompanies that focus on **environmentally sound infrastructure, industrial applications and disruptive technologies that eliminate or mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and/or enhance resilience to climate change**, a thematic that we refer to as Mitigation and Adaptation.\n\n**FTAC Olympus Acquisition - FTOC** \\- $10.15/share\n\n**Why I invested:** With a history of two successful SPAC transactions giving shareholder value (30-60% return) and with impressive experience as a successful entrepreneur in the banking space, I have high confidence that Betsy has the connections to find an opportunity through her connections and leverage her knowledge to find a winning company. Downside risk is currently very low with considerable upside potential based on Betsy\u2019s competence and track record. I am aiming for at least a 10% return here with limited downside risk at this point. \n\n**Ipo Size: $755M**\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBetsy Cohen \n\n* Founder/Fmr CEO Bancorp; Director, FinTech Acquisition I, II, III\n* Founded Jefferson Bank at 32 years of age\n* Pioneer in financial law, banking, real estate lending, investing and development\n* FinTech I Acquisition - &gt; CardConnect Corp  (CCN) &gt; Acquired by First Data Corporation at **$15/share**\n* FinTech Acquisition Corp. II -&gt; International Money Express, Inc (IMXI) **$16.44/share**\n* FinTech Acquisition Corp. III  -&gt;Paya, Inc. (Paya) - **$13.37/share**\n* FTIV - **$10.30/share**\n\nRyan Gilbert\n\n* Director, bKash (Bangladesh\u2019s largest remittance and mobile banking platform)\n\n**Target:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe currently intend to concentrate our efforts on identifying **technology and financial services technology, or fintech**, companies that power transformation and innovation. Our expertise lends itself well to pursuing platforms related to the financial services, real estate, insurance, ecommerce and related technology infrastructure sectors, but we are not required to complete our initial business combination with a business in these industries and, as a result, we may pursue a business combination outside of these industries. We expect to pursue global businesses but may also acquire a domestic company. We do not intend to acquire companies that have speculative business plans or are excessively leveraged.\n\n**Horizon Acquisition Corp II - HZON** \\- $10.41/share\n\n**Why I invested:** With a person like Todd Boehly that has a history of acquiring strong businesses in the entertainment space mixed with the business knowledge of the Co-found of Draftkings and founders of MRC I think that this team has the contacts and frontline know how to seek out and adequately evaluate a successful entertainment business. The downside risk here is a bit higher due to recent hype for this stock, but this team has the credibility to find a business that can perform strongly after de-spacing.\n\n**Ipo Size: $525M**\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTodd Boehly \n\n* Founder/CEO, Eldridge (holding company with network of businesses across finance, technology, real estate and entertainment) which includes the following in the media space:\n   * MRC, a diversified global entertainment company\n   * eSports and gaming companies, Cloud9 and Epic Games\n   * The Los Angeles Dodgers\n   * DraftKings Inc\n\nJason Robbins \n\n* Co-founder/CEO, DraftKings\n* Deep experience building and growing a leading gaming platform, and has prior experience with a special purpose acquisition company\u2019s business combination\n\nAsif Satchu &amp; Mordecai Wiczyk\n\n* Co-founders and co-Chief Executive Officers of MRC (entertainment)\n\n**Target:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe currently intend to concentrate our efforts in identifying businesses in the **media and entertainment industries**, with a focus on differentiated product and service offerings\n\nBusiness combination opportunities will be sourced from our **management team\u2019s proprietary network of operating executives, investors and advisors**.\n\n**Bonus: Gores Holdings IV, Inc - GHIV** \\- $10.72/share\n\n**Why I invested:** United Wholesale Mortgage is a flourishing business. I have seen a lot of pumping for this stock recently, and I understand that it has not skyrocketed as it is a mature business. While I do not see a ridiculous valuation for this company as it is mature, one can check the competitors and UWM\u2019s current position for an indication of where this might go. I am predicting that this could go to $15/share or higher as it is a solid company. \n\n**IPO Size: $425M**\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlec Gores \n\n* Founder, The Gores Group",

        "selftext": "Fk [C3.Ai](https://C3.Ai) with such retarded opening i really hope that it crashes and burns after the hype so we all can pick it up cheap. At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer \u2013 relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**.

With the established applications. \n\n**C3.AI is then able to** \n\n**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**\n\n**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**\n\n**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**\n\nReal world user case:\n\nEngie \u2013 largest power producer in the world with\n\n\\- 114.4 GW power production capacity\n\n\\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money\n\n\\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties \n\nWith the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**\n\n\\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment \n\n\\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months \n\n**Revenue model**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**\n\n\\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**\n\n\\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**\n\nIn the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**\n\nTheir AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** \n\n\\- **Anti-money laundering**\n\n\\- **COVID-19 Data lake**\n\n\\- **AI CRM**\n\n\\- **Energy management**\n\n\\- **Fraud detection**\n\n\\- **Inventory optimization**\n\n\\- **Predictive maintenance**\n\n\\- **Production schedule optimization**\n\n\\- **Readiness**\n\n\\- **Sensor health**\n\n\\- **Supply network risk** \n\n**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.** \n\n **TLDR:** \n\n**There is none cause im too lazy to type one.**",

This is unfortunately not great news for the employees who were hit by the layoffs, but it is a good sign for investors. \n\nIBM has become WAY to big (300,000 employees), and WAY to diverse. It will be splitting into a Consulting business and IBM will stay as a tech company. This means that next year IBM will be a lighter ship which will be easier to maneuver, innovate, and deliver. Im in it for a long haul. What are your thoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Side note IBM is one of the only stocks which barely moved during the pandemic. Now we see upward movement.",

They quickly find buyers; their prices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels in relation to assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid to shame. Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with no overt efforts by anyone to call a halt before the inevitable collapse in prices. (The SEC can't do much more than insist on disclosure of information, about which the speculative public couldn't care less, or announce investigations and usually mild punitive actions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly broken.)

Through **our acquisitions of Origin and SCUF in 2019, we acquired two companies whose sales are primarily generated through direct-to-consumer channels.** While sales from this channel are a **relatively small contributor to our revenue today, we believe direct-to-consumer sales represent a significant avenue to drive growth by facilitating increased market penetration across our product categories**.\n\n&gt;Continue to grow market share globally. As a globally recognized brand, we have a footprint that reaches customers in more than 75 countries. We will continue to invest in enhancing our sales and distribution infrastructure to expand our leadership position in the Americas and Europe. **In the gaming peripherals market, we have increased our U.S. market share from 5.0% in December 2013 to 18.3% in June 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis according to NPD Group.** We are a **clear market leader in the gaming PC components market.** According to NPD Group, we have **increased our U.S. market share from 26.2% in December 2015 to 41.9% in June 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis**. Additionally, **for the twelve months ended June 2020, we had number one U.S. market share in gaming computer cases with a 18% market share, cooling solutions with a 53% market share, PSUs with a 42% market share and high-performance memory with a 54% market share.** We view the **Asia Pacific region as a long-term growth opportunity and recently invested in our local sales force and regional management to build out distributor networks and retail partnerships.**\n\n&gt;Selectively pursue complementary acquisitions. We plan to evaluate, and may pursue acquisitions, such as our **acquisitions of Elgato, Origin and SCUF**, which we believe strengthen our capabilities in existing segments as well as diversify our product offerings, broaden our end-user base or expand our geographic presence.\n\nCorsair does PC components(PSU, RAM, PC Case, fans, etc) and peripherals(Keyboards, mouse, headphones, etc). If you missed out on CPU(AMD, Intel) or GPU(Nvidia), this is it. Only competitors listed in NYSE/NASDAQ are Micron and IBM(Random-access memory (RAM) modules market competitors), and their company directions are very different. Rest of Corsair's direct competitors are mostly concentrated in foreign markets(Logitech, Asus, Razer, Samsung(RAM), Gigabyte, Fujitsu, Toshiba, etc) or private(Kingston, G.Skill, EVGA, Steelseries etc).\n\nIf you want to sell it, go ahead. I am not here to sell you a stock that will fly to the moon tomorrow. This is a long haul stock that's not for short term holders, this is for the people that recognise and understand the following:\n\n#HERE\n\n#Net revenue was -&gt;$457.1 million&lt;-, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year.\n\n#Gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year.\n\n#Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.\n\n#Recovered 2 years loss within 6 months of covid\n\n#As of September 30, 2020, cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of -&gt;$370.1 million&lt;-.\n\n#That y-o-y growth with just 3B market cap\n\nStats from Q3 earnings report: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html\n\n**SO SHOULD I SELL????**\n\nThe stock is not GME(big daddy Cohen coming in to make it the ecommerce giant of gaming world), but they are pretty obviously undervalued. You should choose to at least hold it till Q4 earnings report in February which would include Christmas and holiday sales, that is also what people with GME, NVDA, AMD, AAPL and INTL wants to see. Q4 is where the money is always at for tech stocks thanks to Santa, especially so for CRSR who sees the largest sales number per annum on ecommerce site like Amazon during holiday season.\n\nBut yeah you can still choose to sell\n\nSo I can buy more.\n\nThanks and love you all retards, wishing all you GME \ud83d\ude80 diamond hands send the shorters to homeless shelters.",

        "selftext": "Don't rely on TA alone. The market sentiment was weak this week because of the SaaS sector earnings risks and the desire of hedge funds to get in cheaper for a second December rally. HOHOHO.\n\nSalesforce got hammered to create enough delta for a gap up back to $250+ for accumilation. \n\nSnowflake couldn't stay down and its valuation is absurd, approxiamtely the size of IBM.\n\nPalantir will retest $30 and breakout, just because SNOW did. ($370s) It's up to 2.5X PLTR market capitalization with half the revenue and an operating loss of 14 million. These SNOW investors paid up early for next year 2022. All the Warren Buffett hype and it's paid for WallStreet IPO client/Brokerage PR bias shilling (even by Cramer who won't support PLTR because of the Direct Listing model as an ex-hedge fund manager)\n\nFacebook's underwriters were\u00a0Morgan Stanley,\u00a0J.P. Morgan,\u00a0Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Barclays and Allen &amp; Co. - and they fucked Facebook with a botched roadshow and  didn't say anything meaningful to shore up its 16 month share price collapse. \n\nThey were too busy being bearish on FB and probably shorted it themselves, especially Goldman Sachs. \n\nPeter Thiel is a Director on the Facebook Board and remembers what low value paying $350 million for IPO offers.\n\nThiel and Karp dumped very cheap shares on the first trading day to provide liquidity and Wall Street was (by law very neutral but with a bearish vibe with chicken little risky risky!!!) \n\nThis company would have been IPO listed at $35 a share, still making it much cheaper than the Snowflake IPO. But you can't withhold Wallstreet its tendie tribute. Thiel took it directly to the exchange. \n\nMeme stock or not, I'm disappointed to see the lack of faith in this company because of a broad market shakeout. $21 was a great entry point, but people expect to realize their ideal oversold wet dream. The Germans are bullish still calling it the next Tesla fairy-tale story. Karp is phil-German and speaks fluently while studying in Frankfurt for years and considers it his cultural homeland. Thiel is German American. So was Wernher Von Braun...*cough Elon Musk the South African/Canadian of Dutch ancestory. \n\nYou chose your bets.\n\nCheck out this recent Welt article.\n\nhttps://www.welt.de/finanzen/plus221449160/Palantir-Diese-Aktie-verspricht-ein-Boersen-Maerchen-wie-Tesla.html",

They have murdered CentOS which for you non-techie degens, is the holy grail of linux server OS's.

Alpha -&gt; beta -&gt; release candidate -&gt; stable (overly simplified fyi). Red Hat Enterprise linux was sort of like the RC in that mix and CentOS was the stable. Stability is highly important and valuable to business everywhere. \n\n**So the fuck what?**\n\nWhat IBM has done this week is announce that instead of CentOS being the stable version, it will become the beta version. On top of that, the current version of CentOS (8) was promised to be supported to 2029. With this change, CentOS 8 will only be supported through 2021. 1 year to deal with this situation is just not enough time for many large organizations.\n\n**What does this mean (aside from fuck watson)?**\n\nThis straight up means a fuck ton of companies are going to bail on CentOS and ostensibly, Red Hat altogether, to move to a more stable operating system such as Ubuntu Server. \n\n\"BuT wAiT!

        "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\nGood morning/evening everyone. AT&amp;T won over ABBV and PG in the latest poll (on r/dividends). There is a lot to unpack with this stock and it is definitely more controversial, especially in regards to it's debt. Let's take a look at everything it does, the financials, and a quick look at its investments/acquisitions. The dividend and possible growth with also be discussed. \n\n# AT&amp;T - American Telephone and Telegraph:\n\n**Sector: Communication Services** \n\nAT&amp;T is a diversified global leader in telecommunications, media and entertainment, and technology. It operates four segments: \n\n* AT&amp;T Communications: \n\n&gt;AT&amp;T Communications serves +100 million with TV, mobile and broadband services. In addition, it provides internet to more than 3 million business customers.\n\n* AT&amp;T International:\n\n&gt;AT&amp;T International provides TV and wireless services to consumers and businesses in over 11 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n* AT&amp;T ad and analytics:\n\n&gt;Ad and analytics provides marketers with targeted, data-driven advertising focused around premium video content.\n\n* Warner Media\u2019s HBO &amp; Turner and Warner Bros divisions:\n\n&gt;Warner Media\u2019s HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. are leaders in creating content and operating the world\u2019s largest TV and film studio.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n&gt;\\- Acquisitions have added to AT&amp;T\u2019s economic moat,  increased revenues, increased ability to bundle services (synergies that enable cost cutting).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Billions of dollars in capital expenditures and company investments (over 170 billion the last 5 years).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- The company merger with Time Warner will allow it to squeeze its way into the lucrative streaming market. Having one of the world\u2019s largest content creators combined with AT&amp;T\u2019s services could be powerful. (This will be discussed further below)\n\n**Risks:**\n\n&gt;\\- Lots of debt. This company is quite leveraged. The Time-Warner merger increases AT&amp;T\u2019s debt to the point the company balance sheet should be watched intensely.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- AT&amp;T is largely concentrated in the US right now.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Intense competition from Verizon and other telecom giants. \n\n# Financial History:\n\nBefore diving into the financials AT&amp;Ts goals need to be discussed. Recently they appointed a new president for the company, their stated goals include bringing down their overall debt, increasing their earnings and cash flow through the HBO and Warner acquisitions, remaining committed to the dividend, and the sale of underperforming assets to streamline capital investments. \n\nThis first chart will break down their Revenue, Earnings, Debt, and Debt Ratio over the decade. The source of the information is the company 10K SEC filings. \n\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Short + Long Term Debt|Debt / EBITDA|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|$126,723|$32,443|$65,573|2|\n|2013|$128,752|$47,005|$75,293|1.5|\n|2015|$146,801|$45,551|$129,613|2.8|\n|2017|$160,546|$45,572|$165,665|3.6|\n|2019|$181,190|$56,172|$191,680|2.9|\n\nRevenue as increased 5% YoY, it is pretty solid, for a company this large that has been around for as long as it has double digit growth is definitely not expected. Earnings has increased \\~9% YoY over the decade, outpacing the revenue, this is nice since it is increasing their margins. \n\nDebt has definitely grown at a significant pace, this is largely based off their acquisitions over the recent years. Back in 2015 they acquired Direct TV (gross), and in 2018 Time Warner + HBO. In both 2015 and 2017 you can see the spike in the debt to EBITDA levels above the 3x we would normally like to see, however AT&amp;T has stated they are committed to reducing their debt levels, their stated objective is to bring debt/EDITDA below 2.5x. Already we can see at the end of 2019 that they have managed to bring the ratio down to 2.9, which is a good trend, something that, based on their quarterly earnings this year, they have been continuing. \n\nLet's take a closer look at the cash flow, and their debt payments.\n\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|Debt Payment / Influx|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|$34,743|$20,272|$14,833|\\+362 Million|\n|2013|$34,796|$21,228|$22,706|\\+9,138 Billion|\n|2015|$35,880|$20,015|$39,792|\\+23,927 Billion|\n|2017|$38,010|$21,550|$52,342|\\+35,882 Billion|\n|2018|$43,602|$21,251|$11,023|\\-11,328 Billion|\n|2019|$48,660|$19,635|$15,430|\\-13,603 Billion|\n\nNet cash flow is very strong and growing \\~4% average. Their CAPEX line has been steady, but note that it does not include the cost of any mergers, acquisitions or purchases.\n\nNow, the Free Cash Flow to Equity is looking really weird in 2015 and 2017, the reason there is such a spike in FCF/E is because those are the years AT&amp;T loaded up on new debt, note the spike in Long Term Debt in the previous chart, the influx of cash from those loans is simply being added to the FCF/E here.  If they are subtracted the ratio more in line with the $15 Billion they have averaged. \n\nLastly, the debt payments. After the acquisitions, we can see that in 2018 and 2019 they have been making substantial debt payments. Based on the recent quarterly earning they have continued to pay down the debt load.\n\nSo, thus far we have seen increasing revenues and earnings, strong free cash flow, and an increase in debt repayments. Good trends, yes the company is still leveraged, but not as leveraged as some other companies we have recently looked at (Looking at you IBM - they are currently approx 4x debt/EBITDA)\n\nAnyways, let's now take a look at the acquisitions before discussing the dividend. \n\n# Direct TV:\n\nAT&amp;T acquired DirectTV in 2015 for \\~$67 Billion dollars. Since then (and even before the acquisition), It has YoY decreasing profits as more and more people move away from traditional expensive cable in favor of streaming. Already they are looking to action off Direct TV, with optimistic guesses it'll likely sell for around $20B Billion. There is no doubt that this was an absolute failure and questionable decision, even in 2015, given the trends. This is one of the largest factors causing the former CEO Stephenson to be replaced. \n\nSelling Direct TV would allow AT&amp;T to continue off-loading legacy, and capital intensive segments to boost free cash flow to focus on growth of more profitable (and not declining) company segments. It does come with a stinging loss of over $40 Billion just from the sale alone. The new CEO, Stankey, seems more than ready to just offload Direct TV, use the cash to invest back into the company, and move on. \n\n# Time Warner (Warner Media) and HBO: \n\nThese acquisitions were incredibly expensive for AT&amp;T, however, unlike Direct TV, they are becoming significantly more profitable. The profits for Warner Media in Dec 2019 was \\~9.5Billion, these numbers are down for 2020, however much of the loss is attributed to the impacts COVID has had to the entertainment industry. Now, the introduction of HBO Max streaming was botched and delayed, this gave significant ground to Disney and Apple as they released their streaming services, however, HBO Max is reported to have \\~38 Million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. Their stated goals are to have over 50 Million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 Billion by that time. \n\nIn addition to this, Warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on HBO Max. This move is definitely putting AT&amp;T on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from Netflix and Disney will be. Warner does still have agreements with AMC, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. This just highlights how significant the move into streaming by Disney and AT&amp;T have been. Yes AT&amp;T was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and Warner Media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable. \n\nThere is a lot more to the Time Warner and HBO piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points. \n\n# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:\n\nThe AT&amp;T is a dividend Aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.\n\nNOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.\n\n|Stock Price|$29.54|\n|:-|:-|\n|P/E Ratio|19.44|\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.08|\n|Yield|7.04% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\n|Current Payout Ratio (Based on Earnings)|58.26%|\n\nThe payout ratio may seem lower here, however, using the Cash flow from the chart above, in 2019 their total cash flow from operations was $48 Billion, minus the CAPEX of \\~$20 Billion leaves around $28 Billion in free cash. According to their 2019 10K the amount paid out in dividend distributions was \\~$14.8 Billion. So just about half of the free cash, leaving the rest to be paid towards short/long term debt, or whatever other financing activities.  \n\nHowever, AT&amp;T under their new leadership has several ways to go about increasing their margins here. Firstly, they could pay down debt to decrease future debt payments, this is one route they have mentioned they are committed to. Another is they could cut their dividend payment. The new CEO and management have stated they are committed to the dividend, however, this is a route that could be taken to further increase the cash flow for the company which could be used for more aggressive debt payments, and reinvestment back into the company to further stimulate growth and increase the profitability of their Media segment. \n\nNote though, AT&amp;T has not been buying back shares at this time, in fact the number of outstanding shares has increased from 5,926 to 7,305. This does dilute the value of the stock, however, over the short term (especially if you are holding more long term), this isn't necessarily bad. You will see less price appreciation, but because they are paying out a dividend it will allow you to accumulate more shares through DRIP, so later on when the company can afford to buy back shares in addition to payout a dividend distribution you will see the benefits from the compounding effect of accumulating shares, and stock price appreciation. This ofcourse assumes that the company will move itself in a position to afford this. So the question you'd have to ask yourself here is whether or not you believe AT&amp;T can manage their debt, whether their telecommunication services will remain relevant, and whether their Media services can turn more a profit. \n\n# Closing Thoughts:\n\nThis stock is definitely more controversial but hopefully this post helped highlight some key points. With the new CEO in management it will be interesting to see how AT&amp;Ts current position changes. They have been trending towards completing their stated goals like bringing down debt, and investing into their media services. \n\nIf you're not sure if you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, please supplement this with your own research. \n\nA quick disclosure, I do own AT&amp;T stock, but that says nothing! Do your own research! There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.  \nThanks for reading, and have a good day/night!",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\nIf you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the \"next earnings date\" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

E2Open is the world\u2019s largest supply chain operating network.\n\nPrior to being acquired by a venture capital company in 2015, E2Open was listed on Nasdaq. Its historical trading data can be found under the ticker EOPN (https://www.investing.com/equities/e2open-inc-historical-data)\n\nIt IPO\u2019ed in 2012 at $15, peaked at $27+ in 2014, and declined to $8.5 by the time of its acquisition in 2015.\n\nIndustry Insight/Hype Potential:\nAlthough SaaS isn\u2019t quite as hot as EV these days, there are still plenty of investor interest in tech companies that deliver on revenue and growth. For example, another SaaS provider AvePoint (APXT/AVPT) is trading above $16. Here\u2019s a comparison between AvePoint and E2Open:\n\nAvePoint is a cloud based SaaS provider founded in 2001 with ~1300 employees, ~$150m annual revenue. It will have a pro-forma EV of ~$2b \n\nE2Open is a cloud based SaaS provider founded in 2000 with ~2400 employees and ~$300m annual revenue. It will have a pro-forma EV of ~$2.5b\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare E2Open with AvePoint\u2026 AvePoint has clients like MSFT!\u201d:\nHere are some of E2Open\u2019s clients:\nBoeing, Bose, Dell, General Electric, Kelloggs, L\u2019Oreal, Lenovo, P&amp;G, Seagate, Vodafone, AMD, Canon, Oracle, NVidia, HP etc etc\n\nE2Open has a 4.7 rating based on 500+ reviews (source: https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/e2open/testimonials.) Here is what Vodafone\u2019s Group Supply Chain Management Director and CEO Detlef Shultz had to say about E2Open\u2019s Supply Chain Management Softwares:\n\n\u201cE2Open understands the direction we\u2019re taking as a company, and continues to help us refine and move toward that vision. By automating key business processes as part of a comprehensive supply chain strategy, we have been able to eliminate redundancies and more quickly meet transactional goals.\u201d\n\nHere is an overview of E2Open vs. some of its direct competitors in terms of company size and revenue:\nhttps://www.owler.com/company/e2open#competitors\n\nOutlook: E2Open has been aggressively snapping up acquisitions to further cement its role as a leader in supply chain management. Among its most recent acquisitions are: Averetek (2019), Amber Road (2019), INTTRA (2018), Cloud Logistics (2018), BIrch Worldwide (2018), Zyme Solutions (2017) and Steelwedge Software (2017). The money raised in the PCPL merger would pay down existing debt, improve balance sheets, and perhaps fund more strategic acquisitions in the coming years.\n\nLogistics will definitely play a huge role in the post-COVID world, and as the #1 supply chain management SaaS E2Open is poised to benefit the most from this fact.\n\nOf course, there are many other factors other than customer reviews and revenues to consider when it comes to a company\u2019s valuation. To that end, I would recommend that you do your own DD.\n\nResources:\nInvestor Presentation: https://www.ccnbprincipal.com/investor-relations/cc-neuberger-principal-holdings-I/default.aspx\nhttps://www.investing.com/equities/e2open-inc\n\nI haven\u2019t noticed PCPL being mentioned on Reddit or elsewhere, so I\u2019m inclined to believe that word about this SPAC hasn\u2019t gotten out yet. There are only ~800 people watching PCPL on Stocktwits compared to Apxt\u2019s 18000+. I will say that at ~10% over NAV, the risks here are very low (for now). The merger will happen some time in Q1 2021, and I believe that the price of PCPL will shoot up once it is announced.\n\nDisclaimer: this is NOT financial or investment advice. This is just research that I came across and decided to share with you.",

        "selftext": "So IBM has been around for a long time, but after looking at their website it seems like they have been working on alot of innovative stuff. Things like AI, blockchain technology, and cloud computing.\n\nThese are definitly much needed innovations considering how much the stock has fallen over the years. So I'm wondering if these moves will be significant enough that IBM could again become a major tech player in the years to come. \n\nThere is also news that in the next year there will be a split and IBM will become to companies one focused on cloud computer and one focused on hardware I believe? \n\nAnyway what do you guys think about this? Is there going to be a resurgence in IBM? At a time it was one of the biggest players, and I suppose that's possible again if it doesn't fade away..",

(So much easier if I can see what's on his screen as I try to explain how to do something in TWS, for example.)\n\nI'm thinking I can get G to use some kind of screen sharing, if it is built-in to something else.\n\n***Oh, BTW, if I can't find it...***\n\nI am a software developer, who has now been writing code for 50 years. (first machine was an IBM 1620 in high school). Lately, mostly mobile Enterprise apps in a hybrid native environment, with some database and back-end service development thrown in.\n\nI MIGHT be interested in writing some software for this. If so, most likely along the lines of of one or more integrations with some existing collaboration platform(s). Think: dropping in a live chart, incorporating a watch-list from some software or brokerage API. (We both use Interactive Brokers).\n\n***What hasn't worked...***\n\n(Well, it has, actually, monetarily. But has been tremendously frustrating.) \n\nSignal. Both text and voice, on our phones and (got G to do this kicking and screaming) desktop. \n\nThe problem is, it's single-channel, important trad-able information gets buried in the endless Covid debate, and the rants about his housemates who \"MUST be TALKING ALL the TIME, and MUST be on SPEAKERPHONE, and MUST come in the room when I am trading and think I am playing a VIDEO GAME, I MUST be FED constantly it is an INSULT if I do not EAT it\" and *my* rants about the constant floods and package thefts in my condo building, so ya, the communication channel is noisy.\n\n***What I was thinking...***\n\n**Trello** for brainstorming ideas, and **Slack** for real-time communication. We've both used Trello before - it's my favorite tool for software project brainstorming, and G has used it for construction projects. I've used Slack when I've had to.\n\n***But WHAT was I thinking?! Slack? Hell to the no!...***\n\nBut... OMG I knew there was a good reason **I hate Slack**! But I was \"everyone uses Slack, I must be missing something, OK, I will give it a try.\n\nI've only used it before because I had to because projects I've worked on used it, and have never had to actually set it up, or explain to somebody how to use it. There is the stupid thing of having a separate account or login or something for each workspace or team or whatever (EVERYONE I've ever talked to about this when they are forcing me to use Slack is like \"yes, it's stupid, it's the way the stupid thing works, get over it.)\n\nSo, that's the other rule here (besides that G has to be able to figure it out). **If** ***I*** **can't figure it out, nobody can**. (Don't get me started on my city's 211 system, that no person in need could possibly ever navigate...)\n\n***Instead of Slack...***\n\nAs an alternative, then, I'm considering **Twist** instead of Slack. Maybe it will also be suitable for the more static \"research\" part (as opposed to day to day chatter).\n\nIn any case, I do want some kind of channelized real-time communication. So, at least I there can be a channel e.g. for SPACs, for Catherine Wood components that haven't moved yet (G's sister sends him a constant stream of hot **BUY NOW** picks that she gets from some Russian guy who gets them from Catherine Wood's blog where she congratulates herself on the big run-up on one of her picks, which means that G's sister reliably picks near-term tops which at least are good short candidates.) \n\nAnd maybe channels for individual names, for focus. A hierarchy here would be nice. So, maybe you could look at the text stream for all SPACs, or just for, say, HCAC.\n\nProblem is  I am not a mind-reader and so can't guess what G is focusing on right now. So it's impossible for me to reduce the noise and insure that the bottom of the scroll\n\nI should note that G legitimately has a vision disability that does make scrolling through a lot of stuff difficult.\n\n***So getting to the pernt...***\n\nIf you collaborate on trading and/or trading ideas, **what tools do you use**? Is there something made specifically for trading? \n\n**Are their integrations** in popular collaboration software that are useful for real-time trading (just being able to share in real time a part of your screen - e.g. a chart would really be great).",

        "selftext": "Note: if you just want the code, there is a link to the GitHub repository at the bottom of the post\n\n**Introduction** \n-\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'll keep this short. I come to you today after countless days of FOMO-ing the top, and panic selling the bottom. Emotional trading is a *DISEASE* that plagues many of us, and I am no stranger to it. One day, I decided that I'm simply too dumb to remove my emotions from trading entirely, and so I decided to try to get my computer to do it for me. I think I was pretty successful, but you can judge for yourself. If you want, you can download the code and try out my algo, or easily design and test your own!\n\n**The Algorithm**\n-\nThe algorithm is backtested on the past 3 years of close prices for a particular stock. It iterates over the days, and does not have any information about the dataset beyond the current point (i.e. I made sure it doesn't cheat by looking into the future). The algorithm starts with 100 shares of the stock, and then each day either decides to Buy, Sell, or Hold. The returns generated by the algorithm are compared to those generated by a simple buy-and-hold from the start. The results are shown below, check out those pretty graphs:\n\n--\n**Results**\n--\n-\nTicker: [BABA](https://imgur.com/TwOShiK)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$17140.42\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$19274.65\n\n******\nTicker: [IBM](https://imgur.com/lhWY5yX)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: -$1,376.32\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$403.09\n\n******\nTicker: [PEN](https://imgur.com/B4myQ0t)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$11,794.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$13,176.74\n\n******\nTicker: [GOOG](https://imgur.com/wl01kRr)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$94,486.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$82,392.37\n\n******\nTicker: [SPCE](https://imgur.com/mrIUnX1)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$1,373.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$1612.49\n\n---\n\nAs you can see, most of the time the algorithm is successful. It out performed Buy-and-Hold for ~80% of the tickers that I tried it on. And I think one of the best indicators of success is that it made money even when IBM went down over the last 3 years. However it is far from perfect, because the weights/thresholds that the algorithm uses seem to stop working for lower priced stocks. (For example the algo has trouble with tickers like GE). More work is needed to generalize to algorithm to handle a broad range of tickers.\n\nThis is where you come in, hopefully. I urge you all to fork the repository and download the code and try it out for yourself. Feel free to make changes and modify the algorithm and submit a pull request on GitHub. The goal here is to generalize the algorithm so that it out performs Buy-and-Hold across the market. \n\nI have set up the script in such a way so that all you need to modify is the Decide() method to create and test your own algorithm. My algorithm uses various moving averages and their derivatives to make decisions. Those moving average functions and their slope/concavity/etc are calculated for each iteration and made available for the user to use in the Decide() method to design their own algorithm. \n\n**Download the Code** \n-\nPlease fork the repository and submit a pull request if you see something you want to add/change. (and if you could drop a star on the repo, my job searching quest would greatly appreciate it)\n\nIf you have a broker that lets you use algorithmic trading, you are probably smart enough to adapt this code to their API, but feel free to let me know if you have any questions. I am going to implement this for IKBR, I will post again when that's done. \n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n[Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ryantcullen/stock-bot)",

        "selftext": "Listen up fellow degenerates. Micro Focus has had HORRIBLE returns over the last 2 years and it's been a shitshow.  Was around $30 in March 2019, and hit lows of under $3 a month ago. So why dip into this piece of shit now? **Cash flow**, motherfucker! Even with lower year over year profits (mostly cause of a stupid non-cash impairment charge), they made \"[free cash flow of $304.9m](https://www.microfocus.com/media/investors-press-release/interim-results-2020-press-release.pdf) in the six months ended 30 April 2020\"!!! And in the [interim results](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-micro-focus-international-stock-surged-today-2020-11-18) released in November, they're projecting THREE BILLION in revenue for the full year. \n\nAnd you know what the market cap is, even after the price rose recently to just under $6?  $1.9 billion! Let me tell ya, this ain't no fucking AMC with closed down theaters in the middle of a pandemic. This is a British enterprise **technology company selling for less than revenue**! You know what PLTR's Price to Sales ratio is? Over 40, you fucking imbeciles. \n\nAnd what kind of technology is this? **FUCKING COBOL**. You know that shit your grandpa coded to pay gas for your grandma's boyfriend's 1972 VW Beetle. Yeah, that. It's still around and companies can't find enough help to maintain their two thousand year old mainframes. [Companies and governments need help with COBOL!](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/) You know who competes with MFGP on COBOL? Eye-Bee-fucking-Em. IBM! No one else is going to compete with Micro Focus on this cause it's just so goddamn boring. I dare you, f me one goddamn degenerate on this board that funded their loss porn through COBOL. But you know what, whatever boring ass shit Micro Focus does, they're goddamn good at it. Migrating old companies to the cloud? Done! And it's not just me saying this. **Even Jeff Fucking Bezos loves them**. [Amazon Web Services picked just four partners for Cloud Migration](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/micro-focus-international-stock-pops-on-amazon-par/), and you know who's in that exclusive list? That's right, Micro Focus. \n\nAnd if any of you retards think this baby's going bankrupt, you can go back to jerking off on your loss porn. They got more than 1 billion dollars in liquidity, and they've been whittling down their debt, reducing it by more than $400 million this past year. And don't forget there are lines of yield-hungry Europeans willing to get shitty interest on their money cause you know what other options they got? None! So even though they got $4.2 Billion dollars worth of it, thanks to their [successful refinancing](http://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/microfocus/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=108&amp;newsid=1393816) earlier this year, they don't have any debt due until June 2024! \n\nSo how much tendies we talking about here? No, not that Wendy's shit. Fucking Fuddruckers tendies with nacho cheese, retard. With a fucking OSTRICH burger on the side. Let's say they get to a 3x price/sales multiple, which is dirt cheap for a Technology company. That would lead to a share price of almost $30! 5x the current price. Those paper handed retards at Seeking Alpha were calling this company Micro FuckUs earlier this year, but you know what? Unlike them, maybe **we like getting fucked if it means we make a shitload of money in the end.** So join me on the Micro FuckUs Tendie Train, shares or April 2020 options work (don't get earlier options, so you can benefit from likely positive year-end earnings), and let's get rich motherfuckers.",

Rest of Corsair's direct competitors are mostly concentrated in foreign markets(Logitech, Asus, Razer, Samsung(RAM), Gigabyte, Fujitsu, Toshiba, etc) or private(Kingston, G.Skill, EVGA, Steelseries etc). \n\nIf you want to sell it, go ahead. I am not here to sell you a stock that will fly to the moon tomorrow. This is a long haul stock that's not for short term holders, this is for the people that recognise and understand the following:\n\n#HERE\n\n#Net revenue was -&gt;$457.1 million&lt;-, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year.\n\n#Gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year.\n\n#Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.\n\n#Recovered 2 years loss within 6 months of covid\n\n#As of September 30, 2020, cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of -&gt;$370.1 million&lt;-.\n\n#3B market cap\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html\n\nSO SHOULD I SELL????\n\nThe stock is not Nikola(empty promises and an idea) or GME(big daddy Cohen coming in to make it the ecommerce giant of gaming world), but they are growing. You should choose to at least hold it till Q4 earnings report in February which would include Christmas and holiday sales, that is also what people with GME, NVDA, AMD and INTL want to see. Q4 is where the money is always at for tech stocks thanks to the Santa.\n\nBut yeah you can still choose to sell\n\nSo I can buy more.\n\nThanks and love you all retards, wishing all you GME \ud83d\ude80 diamond hands send the shorters to homeless shelters.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: if you like APXT, you might like PCPL. It currently trades at $11 and has potential to go up to $15+ before merger in Q1 2021 with the biggest logistics supply chain SaaS in the world that services companies like Dell, Oracle, Lenovo etc \n\n\nTicker: PCPL (Neuberger Principal Holdings)\nPrice as of Previous Close: $11.05\nMerger target: E2OPEN\nSector: Tech (B2B SaaS)\nStatus: Definitive Agreement\n\nInfo about E2Open:\nBusiness-to-business SaaS provider, focused on software for supply chains for telecom, electronics systems, computers, components etc. The company was a joint project by LG, IBM, Seagate, Hitacha, Solectron, Toshiba and Nortel. It is based in Texas and was founded 20 years ago. E2Open is the world\u2019s largest supply chain operating network.\n\nPrior to being acquired by a venture capital company in 2015, E2Open was listed on Nasdaq. Its historical trading data can be found under the ticker EOPN (https://www.investing.com/equities/e2open-inc-historical-data)\n\nIt IPO\u2019ed in 2012 at $15, peaked at $27+ in 2014, and declined to $8.5 by the time of its acquisition in 2015.\n\nIndustry Insight/Hype Potential:\nAlthough SaaS isn\u2019t quite as hot as EV these days, there are still plenty of investor interest in tech companies that deliver on revenue and growth. For example, another SaaS provider AvePoint (APXT/AVPT) is trading above $16. Here\u2019s a comparison between AvePoint and E2Open:\n\nAvePoint is a cloud based SaaS provider founded in 2001 with ~1300 employees, ~$150m annual revenue. It will have a pro-forma EV of ~$2b \n\nE2Open is a cloud based SaaS provider founded in 2000 with ~2400 employees and ~$300m annual revenue. It will have a pro-forma EV of ~$2.5b\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare E2Open with AvePoint\u2026 AvePoint has clients like MSFT!\u201d:\nHere are some of E2Open\u2019s clients:\nBoeing, Bose, Dell, General Electric, Kelloggs, L\u2019Oreal, Lenovo, P&amp;G, Seagate, Vodafone, AMD, Canon, Oracle, NVidia, HP etc etc\n\nE2Open has a 4.7 rating based on 500+ reviews (source: https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/e2open/testimonials.) Here is what Vodafone\u2019s Group Supply Chain Management Director and CEO Detlef Shultz had to say about E2Open\u2019s Supply Chain Management Softwares:\n\n\u201cE2Open understands the direction we\u2019re taking as a company, and continues to help us refine and move toward that vision. By automating key business processes as part of a comprehensive supply chain strategy, we have been able to eliminate redundancies and more quickly meet transactional goals.\u201d\n\nHere is an overview of E2Open vs. some of its direct competitors in terms of company size and revenue:\nhttps://www.owler.com/company/e2open#competitors\n\nOutlook: E2Open has been aggressively snapping up acquisitions to further cement its role as a leader in supply chain management. Among its most recent acquisitions are: Averetek (2019), Amber Road (2019), INTTRA (2018), Cloud Logistics (2018), BIrch Worldwide (2018), Zyme Solutions (2017) and Steelwedge Software (2017). The money raised in the PCPL merger would pay down existing debt, improve balance sheets, and perhaps fund more strategic acquisitions in the coming years.\n\nLogistics will definitely play a huge role in the post-COVID world, and as the #1 supply chain management SaaS E2Open is poised to benefit the most from this fact.\n\nOf course, there are many other factors other than customer reviews and revenues to consider when it comes to a company\u2019s valuation. To that end, I would recommend that you do your own DD.\n\nResources:\nInvestor Presentation: https://www.ccnbprincipal.com/investor-relations/cc-neuberger-principal-holdings-I/default.aspx\nhttps://www.investing.com/equities/e2open-inc\n\nI haven\u2019t noticed PCPL being mentioned on Reddit or elsewhere, so I\u2019m inclined to believe that word about this SPAC hasn\u2019t gotten out yet. There are only ~800 people watching PCPL on Stocktwits compared to Apxt\u2019s 18000+. I will say that at ~10% over NAV, the risks here are very low (for now). The merger will happen some time in Q1 2021, and I suspect that the price of PCPL will shoot up once it is announced.\n\nDisclaimer: this is NOT financial or investment advice. This is just research that I came across and decided to share with you. At the time of writing this I do not hold any positions in PCPL.",
