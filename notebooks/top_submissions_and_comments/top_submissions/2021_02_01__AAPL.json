        "selftext": "Every other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who\u2019s still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. \n\nTo all of you who are out there who\u2019ve ever thought \u201coh man, if I\u2019d only bought X stock X years ago I\u2019d be rich!\u201d - if you aren\u2019t holding right now, you\u2019re wrong. \n\nI\u2019m an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn\u2019t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. \n\nI bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I\u2019m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it\u2019s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin\u2019s mistake? No actual hedging. Don\u2019t be a Melvin. . \n\nA good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won\u2019t help if you\u2019re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I\u2019ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. \n\nBut I don\u2019t give a fuck. \n\nHold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren\u2019t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. \n\nIt\u2019s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we\u2019re in dire straits probably didn\u2019t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the \u201cGolly I could\u2019ve had Apple 20 years ago!\u201d guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?",

        "selftext": "A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:\n\n* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n* S&amp;P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n\nWhich one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&amp;P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.\n\nIf you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're \"overvalued\". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.\n\nVolatility is the price you pay for your returns.\n\nIf you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.\n\nSo here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with \"I own XYZ because...\". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio. Free up that cash so you can pile in when spectacular opportunities arise in future.",

If you can't  handle your emotions make your portfolio all cash and trade on a paper  account.\n\nAnd for the love of god  don't call yourself a \"long term investor\" because you are bag holding a  20% loss.

        "selftext": "For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my \"fun\" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. \n\nBy this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). \n\nThen came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month. I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. \n\nI'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There's no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.",

CNBC has it wrong - this didn't start with WSB. People are losing faith in the dollar and wanna hold fucking metal. \n\nYou don't think there's a shortage? Go try to buy a 1,000 ounce bar of silver. Google it. If you happen to find a dealer who isn't out of stock, you'll be paying an insane premium over the spot price. \n\nI'm not gonna get into all the silver manipulation conspiracies. Let's stick to Retard Economics 101: if there's a shortage of the good it means the price is too damn low. \n\nBecause of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there's an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30.

That's why (as another WSB post already detailed) The SLV ETF amended their prospectus to basically say [we can't actually get the silver that we need.](https://twitter.com/BullionStar/status/1360703958029905921)\n\nIf silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball. Because those industrial consumers of silver - Tesla, Apple, Medical stuff - absolutely cannot afford to have their production lines shut down for a month because of one input, and will pay anything to make sure they get those 1k bars in hand. \n\nHow to make tendies? Look what happened to AG and SILJ a few weeks ago when Silver went up 9%. Those two tickers FLEW. Buy calls on them for July if you're responsible, April if you're a degenerate gambler. \n\nHow to do your part and make sure the squeeze happens? Buy PSLV.

        "selftext": "I am not new to the risk of penny stocks,  been playing with pennies for about 8 years now. Luckily, I have had a lot more success than fails but do not take this as \"financial advice\" and more something to think about.\n\nLets talk $HCMC.. the most hyped stock in my opinion over this past weekend and is being pushed for it to still have momentum. If you truly believe this stock will hit a $1 you need to take a step back and learn how much is needed to move a stock with 105.1B Outstanding shares... to put it in perspective, Apple for example has 16.8B.. Apple the Trillion dollar company. I am not saying you can't take a quick gain but read on what share dilution is and how it effects the stock price. When the court decision does occur with HCMC, expect some movement but to move toward $1 the company needs to do a reverse split. I am sure there is a lot more into how a company can reduce its outstanding shares but that is a common one I have seen in pennies. I won't go in-depth in what a reverse split is but look up on that. This stock will move if truly everyone actually throws some cash in it but don't expect a full dollar with 105 B Outstanding shares.\n\nI understand  it can be challenging to filter on what will be the next 30% plus gain in one day. Maybe you have seen 100% - 1000% gains on stock websites. Some of you I see asking for recommendations on a $100 to play with on your first investment. You got to know what would be considered a \"pump and dump\" and a legitimate company.  Let's take $INKW for example, this stock had increased close to 80% today. A good amount of people have posted about this stock the past few weeks, and today it moved roughly 80%,.  Deals with Walmart, selling out on Amazon, and moving toward Hemp water. There is actual PR (Press Release) with recent information on the stock. It takes 10 mins to learn all this about the company, or what you will see people call DD (Due Diligence).  10 mins of my day before thinking hmm  should I jump in? Am I missing the ride? or is this a long term play for me?\n\nThe market for me is just a bunch of hype and speculation. ESPECIALLY PENNIES. I personally don't see pennies as long-term investments. I get in and get out like my wife's boyfriend when I go to work. but you got to know what works best for you and if you truly believe in the company. Lets take some other popular stocks I have seen posted here: $OZSC, $ILUS, $HITIF (admitting I own this one for my weed play), $TSNP. I have seen these stocks have solid PR but would not jump in unless DD was made.\n\nAs you grow to be an experience trader, learn how to read candlestick graphs. It can be a snoozer learning but if you understand it, it will help a good amount if you want to buy in dips or see when you want to sell. ITS OKAY IF YOUR STOCK GOES RED. Yes, pennies are more risk. I had days losing everything when I first was trying to invest in them but I also had days with huge gains. Its okay to hold but hold knowing your risk tolerance. Remember, you thought long-term because you believed in this company and it has solid potential. Long-term is long-term so don't let a bad week make you take a big lost only to see it rise again the following.\n\nI am in no way an expert in investing nor trying to give you investing advice. This is more for people who really want to understand how to invest, but the high from one of your stocks performing at a 100% and letting your emotions get to you can be a rough lesson to learn when you expect it every time. I didn't understand how to play pennies at all firs starting and for me losing even $100 was a big deal at the time.\n\nThere is a lot of pump/dump post on here I been seeing from day old accounts. I even look at the companies they are trying to pump. If there is no website, social media is terrible, or real product ... it is a P/D.\n\nI ask all experience traders to share their advice on this post so we can combat the bots we have been seeing for the crowd.\n\nGood Luck to all the new investors. I consider pennies as a daily gamble more than a long-term. I am sure others view it different.\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust scrolling through frequent questions -\n\nI use TD Ameritrade as my broker. Look into how to use their thinkorswim platform. \n\nI recently opened a Fidelity account to avoid OTC Market trading fee\u2019s though. \n\nFound an article that gives a good summary of some major brokers for pennies:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timothysykes.com/blog/best-broker-for-penny-stocks/amp/\n\nI never been a fan of Robinhood. I opened an account when it was up and coming but didn\u2019t like the layout and lack of stocks that were available to invest in. So not sure how it is today but I do know you can\u2019t invest in the OTC Market through this broker. \n\nAsking for my thoughts on a specific stock -\n\nI really don\u2019t know about some of the stocks that were posted on the comments so I have no thoughts. \nI see some popular come up, like $OGCN. But I don\u2019t know anything about that company besides it being popular on this subreddit. \n\nMessaging me to ask on what company you should \nInvest in -\n\nSorry, I don\u2019t want to answer that. Awesome how you took this post but again I am not an expert. Just sharing my years of experience. I invest with confidence but the risk will always be there. I don\u2019t want you to jump in a boat I wasn\u2019t aware had a hole in it.\n\nWhat I do when I find interest in a stock but unsure on it is put it on my watchlist. With Ameritrade I am able to keep tabs on its performance, press release, and most of all the dip!  But my watchlist consistently change. \n\nAdvice on learning  to read candle sticks -  \n\nMan, this for sure was challenging for me. Probably because it is boring to learn lol. YouTube taught me. I don\u2019t have any sound advice besides looking there. I can\u2019t find the video that I saw repetitively anymore but just searching for it, I see a good amount of people teaching. \n\nWhen I got comfortable, I experimented with $20 often to see if I had it down. I am sure some people just catch on to it, I wasn\u2019t one of them. But now it is crazy easy to read.",

        "selftext": " \n\nGamestop has been shorted into the ground. We know this, and here is some DD I have put together with sources.\n\n# I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. PLEASE DO NOT SUE ME IF PEOPLE MAKE OR LOSE MONEY.\n\nMost of these numbers are estimates and are not exact, but this is hopefully a solid, ideally underestimated as far as retail goes.\n\nMy range for the final MOASS is $10,231.57 as a floor, and an AI predicted ceiling of $130,000 inside a vacuum for short closing. I cannot provide an accurate ceiling, as a direct ratio of Short to percentage increase just become hilarious, and I am not smart enough to generate the parabolic formula.\n\nMy range is between $7,763.68 and $97,500.\n\nMy personal basis for the top of the squeeze is $37,675.79\n\nSome financial institutions have not acted responsibly in the market, and I have reason to believe that GME has been shorted 432% of the estimated float.\n\nTotal shares owned stand at 253,299,787\n\nThe total shares outstanding stands at 69,746,960\n\nThis cannot continue to continue, and I believe the firms responsible for this egregious short selling should take immediate steps to close their positions instead of borrowing more GME shares from ETFs to short further.\n\nThis is unprecedented, and I believe it might crash the financial market.\n\nPlease feel free to email me if you have any corrections to make.\n\nMy findings and estimations are below:\n\nI like the stock\n\n**GME Share Ownership**\n\nInsiders \u2013 23,704,787\n\nInstitutions \u2013 151,000,000\n\nFunds \u2013 40,000,000\n\nRetail \u2013 38,595,000\n\nTotal Owned: 253,299,787\n\nTotal Outstanding: 69,746,960\n\nPercentage of ownership to outstanding : 363.17%\n\n*GME Short Information*\n\nEstimated Synthetic shares: 183,552,827\n\nFINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%\n\nFinviz Float: 50,650,000\n\nReported shares Shorted: 35,538,624\n\n*Total estimated Short positions (synth + reported shorts)*\n\n219,091,451\n\nPercentage of shorts to the float: 432.56%\n\n**Here is a deeper breakdown of share ownership:**\n\nRetail brokerage usership (sources provided below)\n\n* Robinhood - 13 million users\n* TD Ameritrade - 11 million users\n* Charles Schwab - 29.6 million users\n* Webull - 10 million users\n* E-Toro \u2013 13 million\n* T212 \u2013 14 million\n* M1 Finance \u2013 250,000\n* Fidelity \u2013 25.5 million\n* Vanguard \u2013 7.5 million\n* Blackrock \u2013 4.8 million\n\nThere are an estimated 128.65 Million retail accounts total in the above retail brokerages. These retail accounts (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) are not counted in the institutional share reporting, as these are not institutionally managed assets.\n\nMy assumptions are as follows:\n\n* 10% of these accounts own shares of GME\n* An average of 3 shares per holder\n\nSince it seems that retail owners are still buying (from my own perspective) this seems to be a safe assumption that r**etail ownership stands at 38,595,000 shares** in total.\n\nInstitutional Ownership\n\nAccording to the Finra-Markets.Morningstar website, under the Shareholders tab, **ownership of Institutions is approximately 151,000,000 Shares** as of the most recent filings.\n\nFund Ownership\n\nAccording to the Finra-Markets.Morningstar website, under the Shareholders tab, **ownership of Funds is approximately 40,000,000 Shares** as of the most recent filings.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nAccording to the [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/) website, under the insiders &gt; insider trades tab, **ownership of Insiders is approximately 23,704,787 Share**s as of the most recent filings.\n\nPrice Basis:\n\nA post on the WSBN subreddit, authored by [u/joethejedi67](https://www.reddit.com/u/joethejedi67/) on the 10th of February, 2021 showcased a closing of 7,056,150 shares resulted in a price increase of $327.09/share by the end of the day. This is based on the FINRA reports and dates from 1/13/2021 - 1/27/2021.\n\nAs a Floor: If we assume a linear increase with a direct ratio of short coverage to price increase ($0.0000467/short), then coverage of 219,091,451 shorts would directly increase the price of GME by $10,231.57. This is not inclusive of the current price.\n\nI am aware that direct ratios are not indicative of how markets work, so a floor of 75% of the above number is **$7,763.68** personally seems reasonable.\n\nAs a Ceiling: I will refer to an AI on the ceiling, as I am not intelligent enough to create a formula on something with this much potential data. The price would increase by approximately $130,000. This might not be unreasonable, as Tulip Mania raged on,\n\n&gt;\u201cthe best of tulips cost upwards of $750,000 in today's money (but with many bulbs trading in the $50,000 - $150,000 range). By 1636, the demand for the tulip trade was so large that regular marts for their sale were established on the Stock Exchange of Amsterdam, in Rotterdam, Harlaem, and other towns.\u201d\n\nI will take the same rule as the floor pricing, and take 75% of the above price. My personal Ceiling arrives at $97,500.\n\nTaking an average of the two numbers, weighting the floor at 66% and the ceiling at 33%, **brings my personal target price to $37,675.79.** With the outstanding shares sitting at 69,746,960; the market cap would theoretically be $2,627,771,818,098.40.\n\n**$2.627 trillion would make GME the most valuable company by 6.88%.** ($169 billion difference.)\n\nThe top 5 most valuable companies in the world are as follows:\n\n1. Saudi Aramco - $2.458 Trillion\n2. Apple - $2.213 Trillion\n3. Microsoft - $1.653 Trillion\n4. Amazon - $1.596 Trillion\n5. Delta Electronics - $1.435 Trillion\n\nThis would put GME in line with the VW 2008 short squeeze, where **VW became the most valuable company in the world by 7.87%** ($27 billion difference.)\n\n***ETF Shorting***\n\nRecently, we have learned that certain ETF\u2019s are being shorted to short GME by proxy.\n\nSPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT) currently has Institutional ownership of 25,662,569 shares compared to 6,700,000 outstanding shares. This is 383.02% of issued shares.\n\n\u2022 [u/aah\\_soy](https://www.reddit.com/u/aah_soy/) posted the original DD for this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious\\_researchers\\_needed\\_now\\_i\\_think\\_i\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious_researchers_needed_now_i_think_i_know/)\n\n\u2022 [u/jeepers\\_sheepers](https://www.reddit.com/u/jeepers_sheepers/) discovered that on 02/01/2021, XRT short float peaked at 800% -

        "selftext": "Just by reading the title you know what this is about. I lost money to AMC, GME. Not anywhere near people I see in WSB, but right now, I am down $1500. I know this is loose change for a lot of you and honestly, it's not an amount that's going to put me on the street or anything,  but it was my summer earnings that I saved for a trip to New York and cities around (I am from Canada). \n\nI am a business student, currently in University and investment finance always seemed very interesting and fascinating to me. So, since Canada banned non-essential travels between US/Canada borders, I was left with vacation money which was around 3000 USD. \n\nInstead of putting it in a savings account, I decided to finally start investing. I was using subs like r/stocks, r/personalfinance, r/personalfinancecanada for forums and was doing my own market research (the best somebody can do with little knowledge), learning, and was super excited to finally find a sector I wanted to invest in. Renewable Energy. I invested all of my $3000 in $PLUG, $FCELL and the rest in companies that are safe like $AAPL, $WELL. It was fantastic. In just around 2 months, I made over 40% on my 3000$ capital and I was really proud of myself. I was motivated to do more research, learn more, and I felt good about myself (University grades were great, potential internships coming soon hopefully), it was just perfect. \n\nAnd then the GME, AMC thing started. So much contents, memes, to the moon post, that at one point, I completely lost my common sense, my rational part of the brain stopped working, I went from speaking like a normal person to... You know what I am talking about. My emoji recommendation changed to the rocket, diamonds, it's like I completely lost myself into a wild cocaine party full of booze and tequila marijuana smoothie with mushroom garnitures and I drank them all and decided to become a R... (As they say).\n\nMy senses came back today morning once I finally noticed what I had actually done, and realized how much I went against all the single concepts and fundamentals I used to start trading. \n\nI am still holding, because well, market's closed but I seriously don't know what to do. Good companies go back up. Gamestop has nothing backing itself up except rumours of a potential short saueeze and faith of millions who went all in. \n\n\nIt's not the $3000 (net) that's bothering me, it's just that, I started out like a normal person who was doing amazing and got turned into a cult member. I am not hating into anybody of WSB, I don't even blame them. I blame my own judgement. I learnt my lesson but then again, it's not like I didn't know what I was getting into. It was mostly stupidity and greed I think. \n\nAny advice, any suggestion, any smack in the head, reality check would be appreciated. Sorry for the rant. This is the only sane community that deals with stocks currently.\n\nEdit: I would like to thank you all for all these amazing advices, for your support and for sharing your perspectives. They are interesting and motivating. I would love to reply to all of your comments but it's getting tougher and tougher with so many responses. I just want you to know, I really appreciate it and I am grateful for all these rational explanations.\n\nEdit 2: To all of you WallStreetBets people, who are directly attacking me personally in comments or inbox, I get your sentiment and I just want you all to know I don't hold anything against any of you. I hope it hits the moon so that I regret giving up, and you all make up your loss. I feel better even if it makes me 'weak' and 'paper handed'.",

        "selftext": "I feel like there\u2019s a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who\u2019ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon\n\nIs there anyone out there that thinks that won\u2019t happen?\n\nI can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. \n\nBut we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they\u2019re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they\u2019re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?\n\nSame with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can\u2019t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). \n\nI know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion. The people who have been screeching \u201cMaRkEt CrAsH iMmInent\u201d are the ones that have been losing the most these last few years (by having large portions of their money uninvested in the midst of an incredible bull run)\n\nWith investors finally realizing the potential these tech companies have nowadays, and with tech companies making more money than what was once ever thought possible, does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash just.... won\u2019t happen?",

        "selftext": "People seem to think because we had 2 big crash close together in 2000 and 2008, we are bound to have one soon.\n\n\nI want to remind people before the year 2000, we had a 20 years bullish run. Its totally not impossible we get to 2030 with no crash, especially now that the feds baby sit the market.\n\n\nSecondly, we have extremely nice upcoming market conditions. Stimulus checks will either get people to spend money to stimulate the economy, or get them to invest, both will help the stock market. The media is somehow trying to make us believe this is bad, but i think its just bullshit. Inflation has been ultra low for way too long, and feds actually want it to increase. They said many times they won't increase rates before 2023.\n\n\nThirdly, i also think we have more upcomming money sources coming into the market than ever. People from other countries invest in US stock market. With all the GME hype, more people than ever are joining in. Again media trying to twist this to say its \"bad\", but obviously it isn't bad.\n\n\nAnother point is, crashes usually happen for a reason, its not random. You can google any of past market crash and find the exact reason it happened. None of these factors are happening right now.\n\n\nAnother point is, there is a key difference between today and 2000. In 2000, the overvalued .com companies which had PE ratios of 200.... were literally worth nothing! These companies had never made a single profit! Once people realized they invested massively in a .com web site worth jackshit... they sold it obviously. They had no reason to hold their shares.\n\n\nNow check this image about Nasdaq's PE Ratios: https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150305131443-nasdaq-pe-780x439.jpg\n\n\nObviously, you can see the 2000's pe ratios were stupid. This graph is from 2015 when it was at 31.7. What is it today? Nasdaq PE ratio as of February 25, 2021 is 38.5!!!!  5x lower than the 2000s. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratio\n\n\nIts irrelevant if the big hedge funds remove their money from apple and want to scare you into selling your shares. Apple is a massive amazing company that is really worth a lot, and they do make tons of profits. Its not comparable in any ways to the dot com bubble. If other people are stupid and sell their shares, SO WHAT? You will just be able to buy into this amazing company for cheaper.\n\n\n\nSo hold your shares and stop worrying about a 2000 level crash, its not happening.\n\n\nA correction? Maybe. But who cares, this just slows us down a little. Corrections are healthy and help us avoid a real crash.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the award! :D\n\n\nEDIT2: Corrected the PE ratio for nasdaq",

        "selftext": "Corona\\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.\n\nFor those who don\\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.\n\nThe main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) \n\nThe perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)\n2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.\n3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . \n4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.\n\nTo recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID \n\nI have my retarded position 80x 150c mid June",

        "selftext": "You can look at their books, but I believe it\u2019s difficult to make an informed decision about $RBLX without some experience with the website and games themselves. Here are some of my thoughts from being an active member since 2007. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the platform.\n\nRoblox has been available to the public since 2006; you\u2019re not investing in a new up &amp; coming company. It\u2019s been around for 16 years, which is very long for an online game. That in itself is a good sign, but its potential and success is pretty cemented as of now. The lack of worldwide reach (with the majority of users being from North America) is worrisome, but there may be room for growth.\n\nThey are currently sitting at **2.4 billion** registered users. The daily active user (DAU) count is somewhere around **30 million** (see S-1 form in my edit).  Thus, the vast majority of registered users are inactive users or bots who prey on dumb kids to steal their account info via cookies. This is more of an anecdote than something you can really back up with hard numbers and data because it\u2019s obviously not something Roblox tracks itself. Every group and comments section on Roblox is plagued by bots spamming fishy links that take you to places for \u201cfree Robux\u201d and such. There\u2019s a game on Roblox called New User Machine that tracks the total amount of players and shows the most recently created ones. Basically, it\u2019s a conveyer belt of bots with random letter &amp; number usernames. Their security and captcha, to summarize, sucks.\n\nRoblox itself is a game client, but the website houses a variety of games made by users, of varying quality. There are some real gems but some real garbage as well. The front page cycles the same popular games and not a lot of up-and-coming ones. I can imagine it would be quite difficult to break into the algorithm if you\u2019re not already a popular developer. Some people use/pay for bots to pump up their game\u2019s likes and user count. This is obviously against the site's TOS, but it\u2019s difficult to get ahead unless you pour hundreds into on-site ads.\n\nYears ago, they shut down the forum, which contributed to a lot of helpful and insightful on-site discussion. They did so because they believed it was becoming difficult to moderate. Hire more moderators? That on top of the fact that the chat filter (both on-site and in-game) is becoming increasingly overbearing, it\u2019s difficult to hold a conversation on the website, let alone form a tight-knit community. I feel a community is **essential** to the success of a social game platform like this one; right now, it feels like a soulless, barren corporate wasteland, compared to what it was before. Take a look at their [logo change](https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Roblox-Logo-History.jpg), which summarizes the company\u2019s new ethos well. There\u2019s the argument that the chat filter needs to be overbearing because of the possibility of online predators - which is true - but there\u2019s a difference between overbearing and broken. Sometimes, every second word is censored, even completely innocent ones.\n\nTheir customer support is pretty dismal. Not much else to say here, but I\u2019ve personally dealt with it, and unless you are asking something really basic that can be answered by looking at the FAQ, they\u2019re not much help. Just your typical outsourced copy &amp; paste replies. When it comes to accidental moderation resulting in bans or account deletion, or account theft, they\u2019re not very helpful. I\u2019ve had an account made in 2010 deleted in 2016 for something I did not do (account theft; the account itself was stolen) and they were no help.\n\nYears ago as well, the \u201cfree\u201d currency Tickets were removed, leaving the premium one, Robux. Tickets were awarded on daily login and could be used to purchase cosmetics and such. Now, join any game and almost every avatar you see is the default one because the vast majority of kids aren\u2019t paying for the premium membership which gives you monthly Robux, nor are they paying for Robux itself.\n\nThus, parent\u2019s wallets are the limiting factor on how much Roblox can grow, because a lot of the older base such as myself shares the same sour sentiment regarding the website as a whole. Even newer users are seen calling for the \u201cglory days\u201d of Roblox to come back, which is odd since they themselves did not experience those \u201cglory days\u201d. That being said, the general community sentiment seems that not many people are happy with the site in its current state, which makes me wonder if it\u2019s current young user base is sustainable or if Roblox depends on cycling generations of kids and isn\u2019t really capable of building an older following in its current state.\n\nMoving on, there\u2019s a thriving black market for Robux and limited cosmetic items because of the aforementioned poor on-site economy. The cosmetics catalog used to have sales for holidays like Black Friday and Memorial Day. These are no longer a thing as of the last few years, which seems like a simple enough thing to do to keep Robux flowing in the economy, but they refuse to do so. (??)\n\nSpeaking of site-wide events, celebrations like a yearly Egg Hunt, events which were dear to many users, are no more. Instead, they are replaced with corporate promotional events. These don\u2019t yield independent games made by Roblox themselves like the Egg Hunt; instead, independent developers are \u201ccontracted\u201d to shimmy these elements into their games. Doesn\u2019t make for a very memorable experience, and I don\u2019t know if the microtransactions yielded are any higher than they were for the previous events.\n\nThe search function on the website is pretty broken; for example, if you search the cosmetics catalog for \u201cAdidas hoodie\u201d, that can net you \u201cADIDAS ADIDAS ADIDAS ADIDAS\u201d named items that may not be a hoodie or relevant to what you\u2019re looking for at all, just something that\u2019s spammed the tag you searched for. This has been the case for years and no attempt to remedy it is evident.\n\nRecently, user-generated content (UGC) has been introduced to the cosmetics catalog, in which approved users can upload hats and other cosmetics rather than just Roblox themselves as before. One of the only good features introduced in the last few years in my opinion, but as a result, Roblox itself has essentially stopped making any cosmetics themselves.\n\nBasically, with the content creation almost exclusively done by independent users and developers, the site now runs itself. As a result, it feels the platform has been stagnating creatively for years. Beyond updating the game client, it\u2019s not really clear what (if anything) Roblox does behind the scenes to promote growth. There\u2019s a lot of very simple improvements and features that could be introduced to satisfy the user base and maintain the appeal to kids and the older audience, but Roblox seems to be reluctant to do so for some reason. For instance, it\u2019s weird that users are begging for on-site sales, which are such a cornerstone of almost any business, or site events, which should be essential as a social game platform. This makes me worry they are forgetting that their user base made them successful in the first place. In short, it doesn\u2019t seem to have the exponential growth it saw from 2007 to the early/mid-2010s, which is worrisome as the platform as a whole is not doing a good job at creating a loyal user base.\n\nAll that being said, this is my perspective of a player. I hope a developer can chime in with their thoughts on the pros and cons of developing on Roblox, what their Robux income looks like, and how that translates into real-world currency.\n\n**EDIT:** This post has blown up way past the point I expected it to. As such, I feel it's necessary to address some of the points that myself and others have brought up in this thread. Going forward, this will be more of a financial approach that can tie in with my product/customer analysis.\n\n[Here is Roblox's S-1 form.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm) I want to specifically focus on a few sections:\n\n&gt;***We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future. We incurred net losses of $97.2\u00a0million, $86.0\u00a0million, and $203.2\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2018 and 2019, and the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2020, respectively. As of September\u00a030, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $484.0\u00a0million. We also expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in future periods, and **if our** **DAU growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability**. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods as we intend to continue to make significant investments to grow our business. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. If we fail to increase our revenue to sufficiently offset the increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\nRoblox is currently relying upon their Daily Active Users (DAU) to increase past their record all-time high to achieve profitability after a history of net loss. This record was achieved mostly likely due to the current pandemic keeping kids locked inside. They touch on this here:\n\n&gt;***We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth or the growth of our market.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have experienced rapid growth in the three months ended June\u00a030, 2020, September\u00a030, 2020 and for a portion of the three months ended March\u00a031, 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies. For example, our bookings increased 171% from the nine-months ended September\u00a030, 2019 to the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2020. We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods (i.e. the three months ended March\u00a031, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020). Our historical revenue, bookings and user base growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We believe our overall acceptance, revenue growth and increases in bookings depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2022 **expand the number of developers, creators, and users on our platform;**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2022 **provide excellent customer experience and customer support for our developers, creators, and users;**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\u2022 increase global awareness of our brand.**\n\nThe bolded bullet points here tie in directly with points I have mentioned in my original post, along with this section here:\n\n&gt;***We depend on our developers to create digital content that our users find compelling, and our business will suffer if we are unable to entertain our users, improve the experience of our users, or properly incentivize our developers and creators to develop content.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Our platform enables our developers to create experiences and virtual items, which we refer to as user generated content. Our platform relies on our developers to create experiences and virtual items on our platform for our users to acquire and/or use. Our users interact with these experiences, which are largely **free** to engage with.\n\nLargely free to engage with - this echoes my previous sentiment in which few players are really seen spending money on this game, at least compared to the amount who don't.\n\nSo, let's conclude. Where do we stand?\n\n* [Roblox has developers bringing in millions of dollars, with one of them reportedly bringing in $50 million as of 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/vzbeykpuffj61.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb544d5496049a3bd14bce8db3cad31e1896db6a)\n   * Another thing to note here that I thought was funny was the President mentioning his Roblox account being a company goal. Ambitious, or last-ditch effort at marketing?\n   * This is taken from the [2020 Roblox Developer's Conference.](https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/)\n* [Roblox has an Amazon store selling merchandise and toys, the latter of which are also available in stores worldwide.](https://www.amazon.com/roblox?=&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=r05d13-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=5562fc29c05b45562a86358c198356eb&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;productGridPageIndex=2)\n* Roblox runs its own data centers to deliver its platform.\n   * For the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2019, direct infrastructure costs were $58.2\u00a0million, or 13% of bookings, and grew by 66% to $96.8\u00a0million, or 8% of bookings, in the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2020.\n      * This data is taken from the S-1 form.\n\nSo, it's clear that the company is well cemented and has elements that should signify growth, but it's still unclear why such significant investment and presence in the online video game market has not yet translated to profit. This makes it difficult for me to make a bull case for $RBLX. The DPO on March 10th is expected to be around $45. Had this offering been in the single digits or teens, I believe a great long value play could've been made. For me, $45 is a bit too rich for my blood for a company that is hinging on continued growth past the pandemic and a lot of other things going right that should have already happened in the last 16 years that they have been in business.\n\n**EDIT 2**: I feel the need to address a point brought up in [this comment chain, which is a great read and offers the developer insight I was looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/gooabb3/?context=3) A lot of Roblox's viability for future growth hinges on continuing to grow as a game engine &amp; platform rather than just a social platform for kids that happens to have games. Here are my thoughts on that, as things stand now.\n\nFor Roblox to be taken more seriously as a game engine, like Unity or Unreal, they need to continue to rebrand and move past the image of \"kid's Lego game/Minecraft alternative\", which will consume even more capital than they're already investing, not to mention the costs of simply going public. Their VC funding last year leading to their 30M valuation is 7x bigger than the funding of the previous year. Whether that symbolizes huge future growth or dumping the company on retail investors as a backup is up to your belief in the company.\n\nThe game engine uses Lua, and it has improved a lot in the past years. [Here are some images showing what's possible.](https://preview.redd.it/s5b0bxgqkfj61.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1447a41923c6ec69d9626a644d486c54c3af78) Looks great, right? Yes, but their target demographic doesn't have cutting-edge PCs that can run those graphics. From their S1:\n\n&gt;68% of our engagement hours on the platform were from users who signed up through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\n\nThese kids play on tablets, not supercomputers. That being said, any game developed in Roblox needs to work with the economy of the website. Unity and Unreal don't suffer from this, because they were never a social platform for kids. Whether or not that is a limiting factor to growth depends on the games developers want to make. You must also keep in mind that whatever is developed on Roblox needs to be gobbled up by an age group that is predominantly under 13. From their S1:\n\n&gt;For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 54% of our users were under the age of 13.\n\nA lot of accounts could have fake birthdays, lending further to the idea of a young player base. As a result, complex games with cutting-edge industry tech isn't the cash cow here. This means that all the money invested in improving the platform might not result in tangible returns. Furthermore, the most popular games are cash grab \"simulators\" and carbon copies of games that already exist, sometimes with stolen assets. That presents a copyright problem if Roblox is to continue expanding.\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading, and best of luck in your future investments.",

The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20\n\nWell, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--&gt; Very technical. But cool stuff.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**\n\nJust read this post. It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&amp;LangLocaleID=1033&amp;Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

The higher the number, the more expensive the stock is compared to sales.\n\n**What about P/E ratio?** \n\nPrice / Earnings ratio is great for mature companies, but the hottest stocks typically lose money, so P/S is a quick and lazy proxy.\n\n**Got an example?** \n\nTake AAPL's Market Cap of $2113B and TTM sales of $294B. 2113/294=7. So the P/S ratio of AAPL is 7. Is that good or bad? Well it depends on the industry. Typically Apple has a PS ratio of 2-5. APPL had a PS ratio of 7 at the end of 2007, and we all know what happened in 2008, right?\n\n**What does the P/S ratio have to do with anything?**\n\nThere are currently [54 stocks with a PS over 30](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&amp;o=-ps&amp;r=41).\n\nThe stocks with the highest P/S ratio [are getting hit the hardest](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&amp;o=-ps).\n\n**Is having a PS ratio over 30 bad?** \n\nHistorically, anything with a P/S over 30 underperforms as an investment. The revenue growth will outperform, but the overall stock still underperforms, because all that revenue growth was already priced in.  None of the FANG stocks ever exceeded a P/S ratio of 25. MSFT had a PS ratio of about 28 back in 1999, and it took 17 years for the price to recover. \n\n**When was the last time we had this many stocks with a P/S over 30?** \n\nAt the end of 1999 we had 22, making up 6.70% of US market cap. From 2001-2019 we had very few. At the end of 2020 we had 50, making up 4.80% of US market cap. \n\n**How significant is this?** \n\nI don't know, man. 5% of the market is not significant. Also, there isn't a lot of data, only 31 stocks went over a P/S ratio of 30 from 2001-2019 (the other 85 instances occurred in 2000 &amp; 2020.)  Also it's worth noting the valuation of all stocks [has been trending up](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales) because of low rates. Yay?\n\n**What should you do?** \n\nI don't know, man. I am not a broker/ dealer. This is not advice. You can quickly check your individual stocks P/S ratio on [finviz](https://finviz.com/). P/S over 10 is red, which means you should dig deeper.\n\n**Edit:** No I am not implying Apple caused the housing bubble to pop in 2008. Let me be specific. From 2007 to 2008 Apples revenue went up (24b to 32b), earnings went up (3.4b-4.8b), but its stock fell (180-85). During a recession, mr market is less inclined to pay a premium for growth stocks.",

Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future\n\n2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.\n\nEven Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).\n\nTHE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).\n\nThis industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto\n\nu/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: \"Zombie cars and QNX\n\nQNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.\n\nBlackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.\n\nFast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?\n\nSONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.\n\nYou might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\"\n\n3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. \n\nBB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\\_interest\\_in\\_bb\\_its\\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) \n\nTLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month",

        "selftext": "In 2009, I watched my 401k get cut in half due to the Great Recession. I didn't want to put a single dollar into the market, but I refused to take a dime out. I was scared. My wife, who is much smarter than me, convinced me to put $10,000 into stocks I thought might survive a decade. I did that, but I also chose one specific sector to favor more heavily than others. I chose infotech. It worked out.\n\nThis isn't the Great Recession. Indicators are pointing to a very healthy market ahead and a pretty big swing up--if the virus gets under control.\n\nToday I woke up to find EV stocks on sale. It looks ugly, and there's plenty of reasons why this is happening right now. But the EV market isn't going anywhere; it's simply the future. And because of that, I'm sticking $60,000 into the market again tomorrow, but this time, I'm spreading it across a lot of stocks. Some more speculative than others. Everything will be pure calls or stocks purchases; no puts, no spreads.\n\nSome of these stocks are going to collapse to pennies. Others will more than quadruple in value. I'm making this post so I can come back in ten years and kick myself for not choosing THAT ONE STOCK to invest the whole amount in, just like I did with Netflix. (Though I put most in it.)\nI also thought it would be good to get a bunch of EV tickers in the same place, so you can do your own DD and choose which of these might interest you. Or do like me, put larger amounts in the more stable picks, and throw some money on the craps table with some others.\n\nYou'll notice some popular stocks missing, because I just don't have any faith in them. Do your own research, and feel free to add more EV stocks below. Also, yes, some of these companies have (and will) merge, but I'm playing them here for different reasons.\n\nTLDR: Buy when there's blood in the streets.\nEDIT: I'm up 36% on the day, lol, but these prices will fluctuate heavily, and some will fail and die.\n\n**\n\n* TSLA\n* GOEV\n* AAPL\n* NIO\n* BYDDY\n* THCB\n* NGA\n* VWAGY\n* GM\n* F\n* XPEV\n* LI\n* APTV\n* WKHS (WAIT)\n* FSR\n* CCIV\n* RIDE (above)\n* AYRO\n* DSGTs\n* FUV\n* NIU\n* LAND\n* CIIC\n* GIK\n* \n* Associated with EVs\u2014\n* \n* RMO\u2014bullish\n* QS\u2014Battery maker, solid state, risky\n* IDEX\u2014wireless chargers for EVs\n* CAAS\u2014Chinese auto parts\n* EXROF\u2014coil driver\n* CLII\u2014Charging station, largest in US\n* SBE\u2014Charging station\n* TPGY\u2014Charging station\n* BLNK\u2014Charging station\n* \n* Lithium\n* ALB\n* LAC\n* SQM\n* AMVMF\n* \n* Nickel\n* VALE\n* BHP\n* GLCNF",

        "selftext": "I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:\n\n1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.\n2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&amp;P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&amp;P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the \"value\" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)\n3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine \"quality\" and \"value\" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&amp;P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!\n4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to \"Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.\"  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year!\n5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!\n6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.\n7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.\n8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH &amp; TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&amp;P 500 upside during \"normal\" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.\n9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.\n10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.\n\nok, here's a bonus #11:\n\n11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

More such redemptions would prompt Wood's fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.\n\nArk Invest meanwhile shuffled its portfolio on Tuesday by cutting its already-tiny holdings in Apple, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Google-owner Alphabet to beef-up its Tesla stake on Wednesday.\n\nThis is one of the problem that ark funds is trying to mitigate. Many people are very bullish and saying they are 50 to 70% into the ark funds, but they don't even know what stocks are inside these funds.

        "selftext": "Hello fellow retards\n\nI know these are difficult times for this sub and it\u2019s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.\n\nInstead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.\n\nThe following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn\u2019t my native language. I will try my best.\n\n**Palantir as a Company \u2013 the beginnings**\n\nPLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this \u2013 Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government\u2026.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.\n\nYou retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji\u2019s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the DD\n\nFirst of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **1. The Management**\n\nBefore I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won\u2019t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**\n\nBefore we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don\u2019t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don\u2019t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers\u2019 base isn\u2019t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That\u2019s the reason why their products aren\u2019t so tangible for many people.\n\nPLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn\u2019t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called \u201cGraham\u201d and \u201cFoundry\u201d You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:\n\nFirst example is Syria with Graham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the \u201crest of the world\u201d for you. But this wasn\u2019t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information\u2019s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.\n\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)\n\nActually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.\n\nIn their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way\n\n\u201cGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.\u201d\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)\n\nThe second example is about \u201cFoundry\u201d and it\u2019s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)\n\n\u201cAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.\u201d\n\nBoth of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the \u201cmachine\u201d with data.\n\nThe key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**\n\nPeter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)\n\nBut this didn\u2019t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like \u201elook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions\u201c. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn\u2019t get the contracts. This was also the \u201eswamp \u201etrump was talking about.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html)\n\nA fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.\n\n*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*\n\n[https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software)\n\nEven with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn\u2019t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.\n\n[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)\n\n[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)\n\nHow it\u2019s ended? Well Peter\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and \u201ebest practices \u201ein the government\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/)\n\nPLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **4. Valuation problems**\n\nI could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it\u2019s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It\u2019s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn\u2019t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.\n\nNow back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.\n\nPLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)\n\nMorgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.\n\nThese guys are very focused on numbers and I know it\u2019s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can\u2019t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.\n\nThis ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)\n\nHow is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don\u2019t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don\u2019t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don\u2019t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That\u2019s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn\u2019t happened yet. That\u2019s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.\n\nGuys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn\u2019t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.\n\nLook at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I\u2019m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash\u2026\n\nOn page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.\n\nPLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it\u2019s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don\u2019t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **5. Risks for PLTR**\n\nDespite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: \u201cWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\u201d The S1 Form didn\u2019t aged well. Actually I don\u2019t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.\n\nAs PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn\u2019t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.\n\nI think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.\n\nThere are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can\u2019t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It\u2019s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.\n\nThe risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren\u2019t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn\u2019t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)\n\nBut even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000\u00a7. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**\n\nIf you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let\u2019s connect the dots and bring this information to a point\n\n1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!\n2. Military expenditures rising worldwide\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2\n\n[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)\n\nWith Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.\n\n3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don\u2019t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don\u2019t work with it but big Institutions does.\n\nHere is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:\n\n\u201cThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public \u2014 fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars \u2014 will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.\u201d\n\n4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don\u2019t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.\n\nFacebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn\u2019t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.\n\nA remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don\u2019t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before\u2026.\n\nPLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.\n\n5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It\u2019s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I\u2019m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don\u2019t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.\n\nI have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.\n\nIf all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..\n\n**What\u2019s next?**\n\nNow we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.\n\nFor the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.\n\nThe second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don\u2019t got the GM deal? The stock tanked \u2013 for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.\n\nBut in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don\u2019t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.\n\nI would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3\u00df. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don\u2019t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid \u2013 long term.\n\nWhat does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don\u2019t do any market activity based on my DD. I\u2019m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.\n\nMy hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized \u201cthe pumpers\u201d. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don\u2019t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.\n\nI\u2019m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!\n\nLeave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!",

Those are factual events and numbers. What isn't the case are bagholders who have less of an understanding of the stock market than u/1r0nyman. It's one thing to hype up GME as a resurgent mecca in retail.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n&gt; Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; # Improving forecasts\n&gt; Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n&gt; # Key data during the week\n&gt; Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n&gt; Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n&gt; The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n&gt; He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That\u2019s also due to the fact we\u2019re likely to get a big stimulus package.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We\u2019re still bullish. We\u2019re still overweight stocks,\u201d Keon said.\n*****\n&gt; He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,\u201d Keon added. \u201cHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an incredible boom.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n&gt; Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n&gt; Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n&gt; While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n&gt; \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n&gt; Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&amp;P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n&gt; The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n&gt; **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n&gt; **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n&gt; Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n&gt; Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n&gt; Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n&gt; Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n&gt; Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n&gt; However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&amp;P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&amp;P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n&gt; On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n&gt; One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&amp;P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n&gt; Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n&gt; This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n&gt; We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5f4b2427b7d5d4b28aae29e57eecf9b/74d4cbea052ab1c5-33/s500x750/45f747ae1ae952b17ebfa05517216899ec4f49ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jtxCols.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/b6PPTlQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EcVeV4l.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5xLzt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  2.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4p4q8a9.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EgzN86P.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ODRTBoH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3udXvVZ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sMcEWeM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EHTrDMd.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bzVMSxO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/79N1qSy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WwOgLCj.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wZD3pAb.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoNlM.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MuAL2DJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gkCoskC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UCHvMLo.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/To6WCZh.png))\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06\n**NVIDIA Corp.

        "selftext": "So founder PEter Thiel and CEO sold PLTR shares. This is common and means nothing but it makes me think they could have better use for those money. Of course there could be a million reasons, maybe just diversification\n\nWhat I consider special is when insiders buy shares. Ryan Cohen bought GME. And he sold motherfucking Apple to buy GME. He already won his bet in terms of value but fuck me if he planned to make money like this. He had another plan for those money he invested in GME and we didn't see anything yet. That's what could make GME skyrocket in the next years and I don't want to watch this from outside, I want to be part of this\n\nI literally started trading 2 months ago and I know nothing about trading. That's why I mostly base my decisions on what insiders do. And this is why last week I sold my 250 PLTR shares and double down on GME  \n\n\nYeah well, I just got exactly 4 GME shares so far. I'm planning to buy 50/100 more on Monday depending on the price  \n\n\nNot financial advice, do your research blablabla\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6bcy2w9hwi61.png?width=1423&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba5d20dd24d7f2c210f301537d7df21895f49581",

        "selftext": "In one week ending this past Wednesday, $22.9 billion flowed into stock funds.\n\nThis has been the biggest weekly inflow since March 2008.\n\nIn 2008, after big inflows into the stock market happened, the stock market crashed. Most well-structured conservative portfolios lost one-half of their value. Momentum stocks lost 80 - 95% of their value.\n\n\n\nStock Funds See Biggest Inflows Ever as BofA Warns Top Is Near\n\n\nBofA\u2019s gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull &amp; Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn\u2019t been set off since January 2018, according to the note.\n\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/stock-funds-see-biggest-inflows-ever-as-bofa-warns-top-is-near\n\nFed to test bank ability to withstand 55% fall in equity price\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/a262314b-f518-4e69-8db4-fa88b6729aab\n\nFed knows of the inflation spike and they will have to react\n\n\n\nS&amp;P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio\n\nIn Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller\u2019s book Irrational Exuberance, he introduced a price/earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 that averages inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior ten year. Today\u2019s Shiller P/E multiples are the highest they have been in two decades. \n\nDot com bubble: 44\nToday: 35 \n\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices.\n\nThe current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. \"If the ratio approaches 200%\u2014as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000\u2014you are playing with fire,\" said Buffett.\n\nCurrent Buffet Indicator: 195%\nDot com bubble Indicator: 159%\n\n\nMargin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion\u2014nearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000. However, the more important metric to focus on is margin debt to cash in customer accounts. It\u2019s currently at 72% more debt than cash, versus 79% at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Speculation is contagious\n\n\nAmong stock market indicators the put/call ratio measures the weekly volume of put options, which are purchased when investors think stocks will fall, divided by the call option volume, contracts purchased by bullish investors\n\n\nCurrently the put/call ratio is 0.4, nearly identical to the 0.39 it registered in March 2000, at the peak of internet stock buying mania.\n\n\nS&amp;P market-cap concentration is at an all-time high, making index-tracking funds, which represent trillions of dollars in market value, extremely vulnerable to swings in just a few companies. \n\nToday, the top five\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook\u2014make up 21% of the index\u2019s total market capitalization, even more than the 18% of market value commanded by the five biggest in 2000, when Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric, Intel and Exxon Mobil were on top. \n\nIs this it?

        "selftext": "I made this to help you noobs who dont know shit about stocks. This is part 1 of a series aimed at helping you guys have a fighting chance against wallstreet. Remember you are going against the sharpest minds in the world and you will lose. But you have me in your corner and im rooting for you guys, I believe in you\n\nVolume\n\n-A trend that moves on steady volume means means that its likely to continue aka price is rising or price is lowering\n\n-Falling volume means that a trend is likely to reverse, whether price is going up or down, it applies to both\n\n-A burst of extremely high volume means that its trend is likely to reverse. Usually when the stock reaches its peak or when all of a sudden it crashes, keep your eye on the volume\n\n-If there is Low volume and the price stays the same, it usually means thats this is the new normal price. People are unfazed by slight price changes here, this is the new normal\n\n-A second price breakout after one just occured is usually marked by yet another high volume spike. It usually means losers are heading for the exit because theyve been bag holding and cant take the pain anymore or bulls are jumping back in\n\n-a price breakout in low volume means that its fake, the price will recoil\n\n-rising volume during a rally(after a stock crashed)means that even though the bagholders are leaving, new losers are coming in\n\n-When volume shrinks during a rally, it means that bulls arent as eager to keep buying at these high prices. Fuel is being removed from this ship. A reversal is imminent \n\n-When volume dries up during a decline, it usually means a reversal. That is the bears are no longer shorting and the intelligent bulls who got out a long time ago are ready to pounce yet again\n\n-As a rule of thumb, if todays volume is higher than yesterday\u2019s, it means that a trend is likely to continue \n\n-Volume is relative, what is high for ibm may be low for apple. What is low for apple may be high for ibm\n\n-As a rule of thumb, high volume is 25% higher than the avg volume of the past 2 weeks and low volume is 25% lower than the avg volume of the past 2 week\n\n-High volume confirms new trends. If prices rise to a new peak, and volume reaches a new high, then prices are likely to retest, that is go below the peak and come back to the peak to see if it can exceed it or go back down.\n\n-If a stock falls to a new low, and volume reaches a new high then that bottom will also retest- that is go up and come back down to that bottom to see if it goes even lower or stays there\n\n-the true bottom of a stock occurs on low volume and is always retested at low volume. If it stays the same then this is a great buying opportunity \n\n-if volume shrinks during an upwards or downwards trend then that trend is ripe for a reversal \n\n-When a stock reaches a new peak than it was yesterday, but the volume is lower today than yesterday- this is a great shorting opportunity, that is: Now is the time to sell or time to buy puts\n\n- This does not work on a downwards trend as a stock can keep going down even with low volume. It takes buying to move a stock up, but a stock can go down on its own weight\n\n-Watch volume during a reaction against the upward trend(aka panic selling). If the dip continues but volume shrinks, it means bulls are no longer running or selling pressure is spent. When the explosion of selling volume dries up, then it means that the upwards trend will resume. This presents a good buying opportunity or to buy calls\n\n-Many downtrends are punctuated(occurs at intervals) by rallies(price goes up momentarily)which begin on heavy volume. These shake out weak bears which causes volume to shrink and gives a signal to sell short~ this means that short sellers are now sure that the stock will crater because no more rallies",

        "selftext": "AMD was another stock targeted in Robinhood's restricted stock list late last week. This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.\n\nRobinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.\n\nThere are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))\n\nAlong with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.\n\nAMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.\n\nThe one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.\n\nHope this is all helpful!  \n\nDisclosure: I own 30 shares of AMD and will continue to hold for the years to come.",

        "selftext": "Every time I see another pump article on the \u201cnext Chinese Tesla\u201d because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, \u201cNIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!\u201d comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it\u2019s cold AF outside.\n\nSo I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don\u2019t like these stocks.\n\n**1. Positions**\n\n[https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.\n\nA few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.\n\n**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**\n\nDid you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.\n\nCurrent PS as of 2/10/2021\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~25\n\n\\- NIO: \\~40\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~41\n\n\\- LI: \\~19 (It\u2019s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)\n\nLet\u2019s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let\u2019s look at high margin tech anyways.\n\n\\- NFLX: \\~10\n\n\\- ABNB: \\~28\n\n\\- PLTR: \\~72 (peter pan stock)\n\nActual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma\u2019s teets\n\n\\- TM: \\~0.8\n\n\\- F: \\~0.4\n\n\\- VWAGY: \\~0.5\n\nI did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don\u2019t ask me how I did that, the answer either won\u2019t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what\u2019s important right now.\n\nQ1 2021 PS if MC doesn\u2019t change\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~22\n\n\\- NIO: \\~29\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~26\n\n\\- LI: \\~14\n\nYep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it\u2019s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nSome other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.\n\nCan they grow Revenues though? Let's look.\n\n**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**\n\nYou might be one of those Stocktwats and you\u2019re thinking; \u201cbut but... they\u2019ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!\u201d \\*Smacks you in the face\\*, no they won\u2019t and here is why.\n\nChinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They\u2019re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn\u2019t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.\n\nWhy does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you\u2019re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug\u2019s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.\n\nTSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you\u2019re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?\n\nNIO: 100% SUVs\n\nXpeng: 40% SUVs\n\nBrand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking \u201cWell, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.\u201d Fine, let\u2019s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs\n\nTesla Model Y- Price: \\~$52,800\n\n\\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s\n\n\\- Charger network: 20,000+\n\nNIO EC6\n\n\\- Price: \\~$57,200\n\n\\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \\~$9k for a bigger battery)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s\n\n\\- Charger network: 290+\n\nXpeng G3 520\n\n\\- Price: \\~$30,580\n\n\\- Range: 520 km\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s\n\n\\- Charger network: 866+\n\nYou may be thinking the G3 520\u2019s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you\u2019ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It\u2019s perfect for China\u2019s dense cities!\u201d If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That\u2019s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I\u2019d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can\u2019t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I\u2019m Chinese and know some first hand) don\u2019t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.\n\nBack to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy and reading Robinhood as a picture book.\n\nLastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla\u2019s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.\n\n\u201cBut JJ\u2026 China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!\u201d Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.\n\nSolar &amp; batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn\u2019t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.\n\nOh and let\u2019s not forget about autonomy\u2026 no, let\u2019s forget about it (for now).\n\nInternational expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a \"made in china\" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.\n\nBack to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.\n\n**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**\n\nHistory lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was \"made in china\" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).\n\nLet\u2019s look at the current state of margins.\n\nQ3 2020 Gross Margins\n\n\\- Tesla: 23.5%\n\n\\- Nio: 12.9%\n\n\\- Xpeng: 4.6%\n\n\\- Li Auto: 19.8%\n\nWe\u2019ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it\u2019s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla\u2019s solar &amp; battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \\[redacted\\] at $400.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, that\u2019s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!\u201d First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier \u201cramp\u201d years.\n\n2017: 18.9%\n\n2016: 22.8%\n\n2015: 22.8%\n\nThis may not look right, something must be wrong you\u2019re thinking. Well, let\u2019s we take a look under the hood, you won\u2019t find Trayvon Martin.\n\n\\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the \u201cskateboard\u201d design, saying it\u2019s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!\n\n\\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz](https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz)\n\nCan you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?\n\n\\- Tesla\u2019s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.\n\n\\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron\u2019s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.\n\n\\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.\n\n\\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources\n\n\\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network\n\n\\- Connectivity: Startlink? \\*shrugs\\*\n\n\\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn\u2019t trust Nio and Xpeng\u2019s software with your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s life\n\n**5. Closing**\n\nLook, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let\u2019s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?\n\nCCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.\n\nI\u2019m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it\u2019s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I\u2019ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.\n\nAt the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I\u2019ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.\n\nTL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto",

        "selftext": "**Current Conditions of the Market:**\n\nLet me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There\u2019s a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don\u2019t make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous \u201cpump and dumps\u201d where stocks become inflated, and based on fool\u2019s theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research.\u00a0\n\n**Basic Stock Jargons &amp; Short/Long Positions:**\n\n*Long* \\- you\u2019re buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.\n\n*Short* \\- you\u2019re borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I\u2019ll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:\n\n* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.\n* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.\n* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is \u201clong\u201d on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.\n* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10.\u00a0\n* Two hypothetical situation happens now:\n   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he\u2019s making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the \u201cshort\u201d lost money, the \u201clong\u201d gained money, and the \u201clender\u201d made interest money.\u00a0\n   * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the \u201cshort\u201d made money, the \u201clong\u201d lost money, and the \u201clender\u201d made interest money.\u00a0\n* The above scenarios help to show why \u201cshorts\u201d (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc.\u00a0\n\n**Market Manipulation:**\n\nMarket manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy \u201cwhales\u201d or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are \u201cshorts\u201d. Some are \u201cneutral\u201d and act as lenders to make money, some are \u201cgrowth-based\u201d and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are \u201cshort\u201d which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.\n\n**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**\n\nMarket manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.\n\n*Scenario 1:*\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can \u201chedge\u201d or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the \u201cpremium\u201d or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly \u201ccover\u201d, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.\n\n*Scenario 2:*\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name \u201cFANG\u201d stocks.\n\n\u00a0If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing \u201cnewly\u201d purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc.\u00a0\n\n*Scenario 3:*\n\nThis one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster.\u00a0\n\nAlgorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I\u2019ll start by talking about \u201cmarket orders\u201d vs \u201climit orders\u201d. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says \u201cmarket order\u201d or \u201climit order\u201d. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a \u201climit order\u201d, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated.\u00a0\n\nIn the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it\u2019s processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you\u2019re that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m am not a financial advisor, so take everything I said as gibberish.",

        "selftext": " \n\n***TLDR:*** *GameStop can be a build-a-pc workshop with trade-in for a new PC every year (like how people trade in phones)*\n\nI heard this idea being tossed around before and I wanted to make a post to discuss it's potential. First go watch this 40 second video on YouTube since WSB doesn't allow links: \n\n# NZXT Workshop DLC trailer \u2013 PC Building Simulator\n\n[screenshot from the video](https://preview.redd.it/vgryv5esddj61.jpg?width=888&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e87e17d619445b3562992e05cf406e065b5ed75)\n\nThis is a PC Building Simulator but imagine, for a second, if this was real and became GameStop's market place. PC building is hard and not many people either know how or want to do it. That's why people buy PC's pre-built, but it's almost a guarantee that you would get better specs for the same price had you built the PC yourself.\n\n# Building a PC is hard\n\nWhen I built my PC it took several days for all the parts to ship to my house and the power supply was even delayed for up to 3 weeks, so I could not use my PC when I already had every other component. When it came in, it took 2 hours to build cause I had to open all the boxes, figure out what goes where by searching it up on YouTube, and then stumbling to connect the different wires to the motherboard. Look at this mess. Not my room, but it looked something like this\n\n[PC building catastrophe](https://preview.redd.it/mfgp51gwddj61.jpg?width=454&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a8d7e0b4d943021f13da13b60970e317c31b5c2)\n\n# But it doesn't have to be\n\nImagine how easy it would be if all the parts are already opened (new/used) and placed on the shelf and you could just swap parts and pick parts as you go with an employee helping you all along the way in case you get stuck. Not only that, the employee could even tell you what parts are the best for what games you want to play. If you only wanted to play Minecraft on low end graphics and don't need a PC for AAA games, they could tell you the parts to get for the cheapest PC that could handle that.\n\nNot only would this open up the gaming world to people who don't have gaming PCs, this is just incredibly convenient. This would also let people stay in a GameStop like it's an Apple store and just hang out and chat with people building their PC.\n\n[PC parts quickly selected for your gaming needs](https://preview.redd.it/bf2kkrxbedj61.jpg?width=502&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3380fabf8c12007a8e04432afaab0d8312f49175)\n\n# Trade Ins\n\nYou could trade in your old PC and get a discount in building your new one. This would give value to brick and mortar stores and people could be trading in PCs like they trade in/buy a new phone every year\n\n# Questions\n\nWould you go to this? I know for a fact that I would. If enough people can just build a PC quickly and more conveniently at a GameStop near them, would this just bring Newegg and other online PC sellers out of business?",

        "selftext": "Honestly guys.\n\nI'm not some boomer and I understand there is space within the value investing field for technology stocks, but on the front fucking page we have analyses for AAPL and AMZN, two of **the biggest technology stocks** currently that are **massively over-priced** and have been massively over-priced since before the ridiculous stimulus benefits they've received since the start of COVID.\n\nPlease understand, I am not specifically short AAPL or AMZN. I know and will freely say these are strong, respectable companies with long, profitable futures ahead of them. But, are we seriously so lazy that *these* are the stocks that get voted to the front page? Are any of you upvoting these actually value investors?\n\nTake some of the most respected value investors out there. Warren Buffet, Mike Burry, Seth Klarman, you name it. These guys wouldn't touch these companies with 10,000-foot poles. Warren Buffet listened to his partner and bought into AAPL at a time where its P/E was mid single digits and it was hammered by negative news following poor tech releases. Mike Burry has stated that his *entire investment philosophy* is based around the concept \"margin of safety\". Seth Klarman? He wrote a fucking book titled \"Margin of Safety\".\n\nIn no god damn way shape or form do AMZN or AAPL offer *any* margin of safety. Their future earnings are speculative, and I admit they almost certainly will increase, but they certainly are not reflected reasonably in either of their price points.\n\nCan we please reserve this subreddit for analyses and discussions on stocks and methods for finding stocks that are true value investment nuggets? Like GME 1.5 years ago. Like any number of small cap/mid cap stocks that are waiting to be found. Honestly. A subreddit dedicated to value investing and two of the top posts are about 2 of the biggest companies that have every existed and have insane valuations.\n\nSorry for apparent disrespect /u/0toHeroInvesting, your analyses were very thorough, but, I feel this subreddit can do better.\n\nFor the record, I have posted on my alternate account and will post on this one as I get more Karma so that I can make this my strict investing-only Reddit account.",

        "selftext": "tl;dr: Long Dated ARKK puts and/or debit spreads.\n\n\"Shut up gay bear!\" \"Don't short meme stocks!\" \"Cathy will bury you!\" Over the last year, you'd probably be right. However, every single bubble ends the same, it's just the underlying assets and catalysts that vary. You feeling a little bearish? Are you fingers itching to YOLO some puts like last March? Don't short SPY, short ARKK.\n\nThis is not a case to short ARKK just because the stocks it holds are too high. Shorting a bubble just bc it's up is a bad time. This is a case to short ARKK because of how it functions as an ETF. For starters, an ETF is essentially a bundle of stocks. You buy ARKK and you indirectly invest in Tesla, Square, Paypal, Zillow, etc. However, the inner mechanisms at work are quite interesting. Every x amount of dollar inflows leads to ARKK buying more shares of its underlying stocks. Why sometimes so are buying ARKK shares from a willing seller, the money usually goes straight to Ark Invest, where it is routed to the underlying shares. People buy ARKK, ARKK has to buy shares of Tesla, Square, etc. to create new ETF units, the stock buys help the ETF price go up, more people want to buy ARKK because it's performing well, so more money flowing into underlying stocks, etc. You see what's happening? More inflows = more buys = better performance = more inflows, and so it repeats. However, stocks only have so many shares, and Ark has more than quintupled its holding sizes in the last year. Ark now owns more than 10% of the shares of several of its portfolio companies. It is difficult for Ark to offload this many shares in a short time if the company wants to rebalance, as it will move the stock price significantly. Ark has since \"diversified\" by buying speculative \"growth stocks\" such as 0 revenue reverse merger plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what? Well a number of Ark's holdings have increased by 400% or more from last years HIGHS in February, yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged. Tesla's meteoric rise is a prime example. Many of these holdings are now struggling to break out to new highs, and appear to be either consolidating or breaking down. ARKK itself is up 400% from the march lows and 180% from last February, by far outpacing the indices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIronically, more and more people are talking about Ark now, though it is mathematically much harder for the company to outperform simply due to its bloated size. Combine this with Ark's tendency to largely ignore valuations and hold a number of incredibly pricy \"growth\" stocks, and the stage is set for an unwinding. The FAANG stocks are not massively overvalued, IMO. Apple and Amazon are fine and unlikely to crash. Tesla and other Ark holdings are a different story. Sector rotation is real, and Tesla appears to be falling victim. Other high flyers may soon follow. If and when investors start taking profits on their ARKK positions, the company will be forced to sell  off a portion of the underlying assets. This will cause increased selling pressure on the already sputtering growth names, thus pushing a stock decline. This decline will impact ARKK's price, leading more investors to sell off, thus accelerating a massive reduction in holdings which will continue to tank ARKK's price. Momentum works both up and down, and Ark's illiquid 10% holdings in a number of companies may be its grave as it will be forced to sell off its own positions if outflows begin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe it's because we are approaching the one year anniversary of March 2020, but my bear senses are tingling. The high flyers of last year are most vulnerable, and the mechanisms behind ETFs make ARKK a prime target. This is a David and Goliath moment for our gay bears out there, good luck.",

        "selftext": "Yesterday I posted a lengthy DD on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), where I went in-depth on my evaluation of the firm's history, its financials, and why I believe the naysayers are wrong (Link included here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i\\_think\\_pltr\\_is\\_invincible\\_rn\\_and\\_in\\_the\\_long\\_run/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i_think_pltr_is_invincible_rn_and_in_the_long_run/) )-i do recommend reading this first, this post is meant to be a follow-up/supplement to my liking of this stock.\n\nBut I wanted to go more in-depth into just why I find this company so special and unique. As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we'll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).\n\nWhat is truly unique about Palantir's software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir's software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company's clients' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir's cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.\n\nNow, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov't). But I think what boomers don't understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.\n\nLet me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest's large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla's performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn't have access to trial data on say, congested roads.\n\nBack to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR's revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company's growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir's clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn't talk up Palantir's greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!\n\nThe reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir's platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.\n\nThis gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? \n\nLet's start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn't *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn't add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett's whole commitment to \"value.\"\n\n[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the \"gold standard\" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don't even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.\n\nAnd while we're at it, let's talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I'll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we'll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That's fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn't understand technology).\n\nSince the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let's talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. \n\nIf you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.\n\nI also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don't know what that means, basically PLTR didn't have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).\n\nAnd this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren't oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).\n\nThis is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday's DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.\n\n\\*\\***This is not financial advice. I recommend you read up on PLTR, pour through its financials, and hear more from its CEO, Alex Karp, and Chairman, Peter Thiel- then make your own informed, balanced, intelligent, rational decision. Without a doubt, this will be** ***the*** **company being discussed in the decades to come, and I just want to expedite the conversation now.**",

        "selftext": "This BaBy is taking off. BB these past 3 weeks has gone through a shit storm and none of us BB holders know why. It is the most undervalued stock I\u2019ve ever seen in my investing life. BB is your wife\u2019s boyfriend when he comes over for dinner dressed all nice and shit to impress you so that he can fuck your wife after dinner.\n\nListen to me when I tell you this. Blackberry is a company that used to sell phones back in like 12 BC, it flourished for a bit until Apple came in and beat BB into the multiverse.\n\nLast few years blackberry floating around in time and space realized that it missed some sweet juicy titties and decided that it wants to go back to the physical world so that it can get a taste of some good ol\u2019 titty juice. And decided to move into cybersecurity, or just a security company in general. And I mean the absolute best security the world has to offer, just a few hours ago BB won as the best autonomous cybersecurity company in 2021. And that\u2019s just scratching the surface. World governments still use Blackberry phones and services because of how much they trust it. Including the US government.\n\nBB has a product called QNX that ensures the safety of the next big thing - Autonomous vehicles. And it\u2019s working with every fucking one. just to name a few giants using QNX - Ford, Motional, Baidu(China\u2019s google), Audi, GM, Toyota, VW, BMW and more. All of these auto giants are currently working on AV\u2019s and use BB\u2019s QNX, except for Apple and Tesla, but they\u2019ll join in soon enough, Why? Because Blackberry\u2019s QNX was approved by the government, whereas Tesla has yet to do that. QNX is currently installed on about 200M cars and that\u2019s just the beginning. No we won\u2019t see profit this March because it is yet to boom. \n\nanother product BB offers is only the best cybersecurity software available for you an I, called - Cyclance.

        "selftext": "For the life of me I seem to be confused about selling covered calls. Here is my scenario: I own 400 shares of AAPL with an average price of $135. Now it shows that there is a strike price of $137 expiring next week, with a bid of $0.90. \n\nSo I can sell 4 contracts (since I have 400 shares) at the strike price of $137 for next week, with the bid of $0.90. 0.90*400 = $360 from the premium. So if next week comes, and AAPL is only at $136 and not my strike price of $137, then that day of expiry I will keep my shares, but also make $360? And if say AAPL is $140 by the expiry date, then I still make $360 + I make the difference of selling 400 shares at $137 so an additional $800 so my total profit for that week would be $1,160 (minus commission fees).

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **GameStop** Volatility is picking up\n* **\u201cMeme Stock\u201d** phenomenon is not going away\n* **Success in GME** could unleash coordinated runs that will swamp the system\n* **Instant clearing** will not occur quickly\n* **Regulators** will need to step in or the markets may destabilize under the speculative assault\n\nAfter a few weeks of \u201cnormal\u201d 20%-30% intraday moves GameStop stock is once again becoming parabolic nearly quintupling in yesterday\u2019s regular market trade and after hours session as it rocketed from $46 to $200 before finally settling at $168.\n\n#### Volatility is picking up\n\nThe volume in after hours alone\u00a0 surpassed regular hours trading with more than 41M shares changing hands. It is very possible that GME volume today could exceed 100M shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as AAPL.\n\nThe fact that GME\u2019s volume could approach the volume of AAPL \u2013 a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd. But GME is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis. It is the preeminent \u201cmeme stock\u201d which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the Reddit r/wallstreetbets bulletin board.\n\n#### Copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes\n\nThe GME phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination, mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant, highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow.\u00a0\n\nWhile this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market. We\u2019ve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced RobinHood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house. RobinHood has since shored up its balance sheet, but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity, especially if the GameStop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5X or 10X new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded, financially dubious securities creating massive 200%-500% daily moves.\n\n#### Regulators Will Need to Step In\n\nWe have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that haven\u2019t changed much in centuries. It is absolutely clear that if \u201cmeme trading\u201d is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions \u2013 a task easier said than done. The clearing of trades is a multi-trillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 99.99% uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow. Yesterday\u2019s FEDWIRE wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions \u2013 a much larger and more important business \u2013 is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a \u201cbrownout\u201d event \u2013 much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in Texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply.\n\nThe events in Texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold. The very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation.\n\n#### Long term Bans may be the Only Policy Play\n\nAt this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal, cultural and technological directives to instantly move to real-time settlement. The only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25% in a day absent any material financial information from the company. The suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current\u00a0 versions that are in place. Regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the \u201cmeme stock\u201d security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes. The bans would have to be backed by strict civil penalties for any OTC trading of such securities so that the threat of punitive damages would cool off speculative flows.\u00a0\n\nIf a hobbyist Robin Hood trader who held $2000 of a suspended meme stock suddenly faced the prospect of a $50,000 fine for illegally trading it, the speculative fervor would cool.\n\n#### Anathema to Free Markets\n\nThis is of course a complete anathema to the notion of friction free securities markets where any participant is at liberty to do use his capital as he pleases. It is undoubtedly a drastic solution to the problem at hand, but for now it may be the only policy choice to make given the unintended consequences of letting this phenomena play itself out without any supervision.\n\nThe current financial system is simply unprepared and incapable of absorbing highly coordinated speculative flows that could overrun the underlying business of the global capital markets. The ultimate irony of the GameStop saga is that the very technology that has created unimaginable freedom to transact instantly at minimal cost may invite the most restrictive response imaginable in order to avoid a massive destabilization of the markets.\u00a0\n\n[www.60secondinvestor.com](https://www.60secondinvestor.com)",

        "selftext": "Friday 2/26/21 $GME Update:\n\n- Opened: $117.46\n- Closed: $101.74\n- Total Volume: 91,000,000\n- Total Shorts: 22,250,000\n- Short Percentage: 25%\n- Borrow Rate: 9%\n\nhttps://fintel.io/ss/us/gme\n\n~~~\n\nWell, today was a battle. \n\nAnd I think I was wrong. Let me explain our situation as I currently see it through hind-sight.\n\nThey shorted over 22mil shares today to try and drive the price under $100. That's 55mil short sales in 48 hours.\n\nConsidering the 9% borrow rate, a lot of these are still outstanding as well.\n\nAs an aside, I still want to know how in the flying fairy fuckery you can find 22mil shares in a single day to borrow to short, when only 350,000 were available at the opening to the day. You're telling me shares to lend get 6500% easier to find as the day goes on? Directly following a day they just shorted 33,000,000 shares?\n\nIf you think any alphabet agency is going to help us, the last two days should show you that they just don't care about investigating what the hedgies are doing during all of this. If 55,000,000 shorts in two days, on a stock with 70,000,000 shares, doesn't raise alarms... nothing will. We're on our own. And if this really does crash the market at the end of all of this, it's 100% the SEC's fault for not stepping in when shit like this is obvious befuckery. They are complicit in allowing it to happen.\n\nSo what happened today?...\n\nI think a sneaky smart play was made.\n\nLooking at the Open Interest on call options on the chain, the $105-$150 options had INSANE volume today.\n\nThere is 744 Open Interest for the $110C 26Feb21... There was 7,719 Volume today!\n\nThere is 1,150 Open Interest for the $120C 26Feb21... There was 10,282 Volume today!\n\nThere is 3,064 Open Interest for the $150C 26Feb21... There was 24,586 Volume today!\n\nSo what do I think happened behind the scenes today?\n\nI think all the call sellers from $100 and down were hedging their deliveries with higher calls... but I think ending at $101 is going to force them to deliver on their own.\n\nOver 47,000 Call Options finished ITM at $101.\n\nThat's \"only\" $470,000,000 to exercise those contracts and force delivery of 4,700,000 shares next week. Remember, they spent $200,000,000 in borrowing fees shorting the stock yesterday alone. They spent another $200,000,000 today in borrowing fees. Half a billion is nothing in this war.\n\nThere were another ~30,000 options waiting to hit from $105-$150. But I think someone was brilliantly smart enough to keep them out of the money...\n\nI think someone knew that those 30,000 call options were the hedgies only option to help cover those 4,700,000 shares without going to the market for them. And I think the big players let it finish at $101 because they knew it would cause the most pain from deliveries for the hedgies.\n\nThey let the price run up just barely under $150 to force the hedgies to cover with those higher calls... and then allowed the price to pull back to make them lose the premium and force them OTM. This is a well-known options attack plan. They literally played the hedgie's game against the hedgies.\n\nIt was too easy to push the price to $143 this morning, and I think someone knew something was up and changed the battle plan.\n\nSo now we stand at a possible 4,700,000 shares needing to be delivered by Tuesday, plus whatever outstanding shorts now exist from those 55,000,000 shorts in the last two days... plus the (at least) 60% previous short float.\n\nLet's be conservative and say that they paid off 75% of the shorts from this week, and 50% of the shorts from the finra report...\n\n70,000,000 float x .6 (60% short) = 42,000,000. Let's say they cleared half of it... 21,000,000 shares.\n\n55,000,000 shares shorted this week. Let's say they cleared 75% of them...  13,750,000 shares.\n\nAnd let's say that only half of those 4,700,000 get exercised this weekend, or that half were sold covered... 2,350,000 shares.\n\nAt the BEST... they are now 37,100,000 shares in the hole... or 53% of the total share count.\n\nGME fell off the FTD threshold limit on 1/29/21. It needs to have 450,000 FTDs to qualify for the 0.5% threshold.\n\nOn 1/29/21... every single call option under $325 finished ITM, and you can expect at least a couple of them exercised, so I'm expecting the FTDs from the first half of February to explode in size once again. And this time they wouldn't have the ETFs to liquidate to cover those deliveries (XRT blew up to over 2,000,000 FTDs on the same 1/29/21).\n\nThey stopped this from exponentially blowing up the FTDs by NOT ALLOWING THE OPTIONS TO BE EXERCISED THAT DAY.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-in-talks-to-settle-finra-probes-into-options-trading-practices-outages-11614366379\n\n\"Call options give investors a right, but not an obligation, to buy a specific amount of stock at a specific price, known as the strike price, during a specific window of time before they expire. If a call option is \u201cout of the money,\u201d meaning the price of the underlying stock is below the strike price, a customer is better off letting the option expire.\n\nIn January, Robinhood noticed some users \u201cwere occasionally exercising OTM options, causing them to suffer losses immediately upon exercise,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. Robinhood put a warning system in place and required customers looking to exercise out-of-the-money options to speak with a company representative first. On Jan. 29, it stopped allowing customers to exercise out-of-the-money options.\"\n\nRobinhood literally DID NOT ALLOW you to exercise an OTM call option on 1/29/21 to stop the deliveries of GME.\n\nA company has to stay on the threshold limit for 5 consecutive days to start the 13 day clock for forced FTD closings.\n\nIf GME had over 450,000 FTDs on Feb 1, that would make day five 2/5/21. You get 13 trading days to close those FTDs once it's on the threshold report or it gets forced on the thirteenth day.\n\n13 trading days from 2/5/21 is this last Wednesday, 2/24/21. The day that share prices exploded from $50 to $170 in a single hour.\n\nWednesday may have been those FTDs force covering, which caused a small gamma squeeze on the open options.\n\nIf that's true, and we got another FTD reset on Thursday, we are about to start the clock fresh on Tuesday when these current options fail to deliver on time. That would put the next forced closing on...\n\nYou're not going to fucking believe this...\n\n...exactly 19Mar21.\n\nEVERYTHING KEEPS COMING BACK TO 3/19/21.\n\nThey spent half-of-a-billion-dollars (five-hundred-million) in BORROWING FEES ALONE this week to drive GME's price down low enough to keep the deliveries reasonable and keep it off the FTD threshold list. It was their last chance to drag this clusterfuck out a few more months... but I think closing over $100 may have just sealed the date.\n\nThey didn't just short over 55,000,000 shares in a single week at $100 per share to get out from under their short positions; they did it to try and limit the deliveries from these options... and they failed.\n\nSo I went to do some research on stocks that would have ZERO relation to Gamestop in this fiasco.\n\nIf you look at AAPL and it's option chain... you see that all put options have very low open interest for 2/26/19, 3/5/21, and 3/12/21...\n\nOn 3/19/21... Put interest EXPLODES in contract numbers and volume... \n\nMarch 26 goes back down to almost zero.\n\nFacebook is the same. Coca Cola is the same. Starbucks is the same. Johnson and Johnson is the same.\n\nWhy the hell are investors in Facebook, Coca Cola, Starbucks, and JnJ all hedging against the exact same date? What would JNJ and Starbucks have to do with GameStop?\n\nMarket makers are hedging what they own with puts to save the value of their shares they currently own in case the market implodes.\n\nI'm marking my calendar... 3/19/21 is lining up perfectly to be the day the shit truly hits the fan for the market.\n\nWe're in the endgame boys.\n\n~~\n\nEdit: u/Scfi4444 added below that 3/19/21 is a quad witching date (market index futures, market index options, stock options, and stock futures all expire on the same date)",

The Ark funds have been hit hard and faced some liquidations. Cathie publicly told everyone her plan if faced with liquidations, she planned to sell the megacap stocks so she wouldn't have to touch her illiquid small caps.\n\nWell thats exactly what the ARK funds did this week. As of today ARKK no longer holds any FB, AMZN, AAPL, TSM and BABA. She sold all of it this week and bought more small caps and TSLA. Now ARK is is a very precarious situation. Their biggest stocks are now TSLA, PYPL, SHOP and SQ. If the sell off continues and ARK will be forced to sell these stocks or sell their illiquid small caps.\n\nA lot of people have taken note of this, including hedge funds which may enter predatory shorts if they think ARK is vulnerable. The next couple of weeks is crucial for ARK, should the market go back up they will look like geniuses, but should it go down...they will be in a world of pain.\n\nIf ARK is forced to sell the small caps which are illiquid, it will crash the prices and crater ARK's NAV. This will add to the bad performance and may accelerate redemptions creating a death spiral.\n\nEDIT: I was wrong about TSM. They still have .5% TSM",

        "selftext": "I did some backtesting with the data from the beginning of 1995 to this year, and found that if you hold GE from the beginning of 1995 to the end of 1998, MSFT from the beginning of 1999 to the end of 2000, then GE from 2001 to 2004, XOM 2005 to 2011, AAPL 2012 to 2018, MSFT 2019 to 2020 and switch to AAPL at the beginning of this year, the total return is more than 1800%, which is quite a bit higher than SPY at about 750%.\n\nThis is without considering dividends and only switch holding at the end of year the dethroning happened. SPY should perform quite a bit better with dividends but I doubt the return would be that much better. On top of that, my backtesting is done with portfolio adjustment happens only at the end of the year. If the switching is done on the month the dethroning happened, the total return might be quite a bit better but I had some trouble finding data.\n\nMy current ideas of why this works is that when a company becomes the one with largest market cap in the world, is usually still have some growth potential, while when it gets dethroned the decline is usually quite small, it could also still be growing, just not as fast as the new market cap king. So only holding the largest market cap company allows the investor to enjoy greater than average growth and suffer less decline in the long run.\n\nMy backtesting data is the in table below:\n\n|Period|Holding|Purchasing price|Selling price|Return|Aggregate return|SPY|SPY aggregate return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1995-1998|GE|8.13|32.68|301.97%|301.97%|45.7\\~123.37|169.96%|\n|1999-2000|MSFT|34.9|21.69|\\-37.85%|149.82%|132|188.84%|\n|2001-2004|GE|44.94|35.09|\\-21.92%|95.06%|118.16|158.56%|\n|2005-2011|XOM|51.02|84.76|66.13%|224.06%|131.32|187.35%|\n|2012-2018|AAPL|14.62|39.44|169.77%|774.21%|269.93|490.66%|\n|2019-2020|MSFT|99.55|222.42|123.43%|1853.21%|375.31|721.25%|\n|2021|AAPL|133.52|135.37|1.39%|1880.27%|392.64|759.17%|",

        "selftext": "So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we\u2019ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.\n\nA lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don\u2019t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.\n\nNow we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us \ud83e\udd8d have to be wary of.\n\nAs much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market\u2019s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We\u2019ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.\n\nAnd well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.\n\nSo here\u2019s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn\u2019t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.\n\nBut that\u2019s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.\n\nNow, the thesis is that growth firms\u2019 future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here\u2019s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).\n\nEssentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.\n\nBut think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.\n\nThey faced the same problems. I\u2019m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn\u2019t have the cash to survive in the EV market.\n\nI watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. \nHe shore could.\n\nYes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn\u2019t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain\u2019t cheap. \n\n(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).\n\nAnd if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. \n\nIs it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.\n\nBut no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd21.\n\nFuck the shills who say Palantir can\u2019t continue robust growth or be profitable. \n\nOn top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov\u2019t clients at roughly 52%, but let\u2019s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don\u2019t want to get too political here, but broadly, you\u2019re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon (amongst alm of them, they have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).\n\nAnd let\u2019s take what Cathie Wood said the other day: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.\n\nGiven PLTR traces its roots to the CIA\u2019s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this will provide much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.\n\nFurthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.\n\nThe answer is yes. But Wall St doesn\u2019t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren\u2019t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don\u2019t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI do.\n\nBut we almost just always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir\u2019s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.\n\nI believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.\n\nAnd I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Carp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.\n\nAs a disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice.\n\nPLTR TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Please share with me how you wish you didn\u2019t fall for it today and how you kept averaging down yet it is still going down, after you do that read this \n\n\nUnderstanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology\n\nCheck out my profile for stock Analysis by request.\n\nStock market intraday patterns \u2013 all times are in Eastern Standard Time!\n\nWhen day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.\n\n9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!\n\n9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.\n\n10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.\n\n11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to \u2018drift\u2019 for the next hour or more.\n\n11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.\n\n1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.\n\n2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.\n\n\\---\n\n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big \u201cShake-out\u201d points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.\n\nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.\n\n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It\u2019s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or \u201ccross\u201d.\n\nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade\n\n1. Portfolio fit \u2013 Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.\n2. Liquidity Check \u2013 If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance \u2013 look for \u201cAverage Volume.\u201d Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest \u2013 this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.\n3. IV Percentile \u2013 Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it\u2019s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it\u2019s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it\u2019s current volatility is low \u2013 and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.\n4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.\n5. Strike Price \u2013 First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity \u2013 delta \u2013 to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well \u2013 higher intrinsic value.\n\nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.\n\n6. Expiration \u2013 Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta \u2013 a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date \u2013 your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.\n\n7. Position size \u2013 This is important \u2013 BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It\u2019s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.\n\n8. Future moves \u2013 Think beyond what\u2019s going on with a stock than just in the current day \u2013 unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don\u2019t rush your entry \u2013 You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I\u2019d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.",

        "selftext": "I've been investing in a TFSA since August 2020. I started on WS and quickly realized you're getting screwed on US stocks because of their conversion fee. In 6 months, I made 6% profit on my portfolio. \n\nI've spent countless hours and a lot of time doing DD, reading articles and checking Reddit. My US portfolio is well balanced between APPLE, FEDEX and DEERE. It's growing at a snail pace. It's difficult to spend time on FIN-reddit or Fin-Twitter and not feel like you're the one not taking risk and not making a profit. (Especially in this MEME stock era)\n\nOn Jan 8th 2021, I added 1500$ to my WS TFSA account. I had been deepdiving and tracking CAD stocks related to BTC. If you look at my Reddit user history, I made a thread about it back then. \nJanuary 13th, I purchased 340 shares of BITF at 4.49$.  \n\nIt went up the next day to 4.98$. Didn't pull the trigger, decided to ride it out. Then BTC prices went down. It went all the way down to 2.40 on January 27th in the middle of the GME madness. I had serious doubts and really wished I had sold quickly so I could have jumped on the MEME madness. \n\nSo I held...\nand held...\n\nUntil last Monday, for the first time since January 13th, the price was up. Figured i'd cut my loss and make a small profit. So I sold my 340 shares of BITF at 484$. Made 166$ profit. I was happy, it didnt turn into a red loss. \n\nWith FOMO in full effect, I jumped on SCR. Where I'm currently back at around my original 1500$ investment cause of the pullback yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile if I had just being patient and continued with BITF. My investment would be 2713$ now. \n\nSo to all you newbies just starting, don't go chasing a quick buck. Be patient. Even when you think you've been patient enough, find some more. \n\nI've decided to stop looking daily at my investment and just ride this for a while. I believe in all 4 of my investments. No need to panic trade or runaround with FOMO.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: Apple will soon introduce a quality over quantity ad platform that will demolish all existing ad platforms.\n\nWhat\u2019s up retards, back with a hot take on a nice little company. This time Apple. Last time I was here I called Snap (while it was at $15) adding targeting marketing so at least take some time and try and poke holes in this pipe dream.\n\nTable of Contents:\n* IOS14\n* Apple doesn\u2019t make dumb money decisions\n* Facebook plans feature to bypass new restrictions\n* Facebook files anti-trust lawsuit\n* The small business and PPC community is scared as fuck\n* The last thing Apple doesn\u2019t control in their closed ecosystem\n* Mobile ads have become a meme and are the last detrimental image found on Apple devices\n* The largest market cap on the NYSE\n    * Recent YoY growth at Trillion Market Cap\n* 100% of the market share\n* Consistent growth since the IPO of apple with a long-term perspective\n* What\u2019s the upside? ($750B)\n* App Store Search Ads \n    * Back-end platform already exists\n* The war that\u2019s brewing / They aren\u2019t afraid of murdering a company regardless the size\n\nAntitrust:\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-v-facebook-after-years-tension-legal-battle-looms-n1256008\n\nFundamental explanation of what blocking tracking actually means: \nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/safari-for-ios-14-and-macos-11-how-to-prevent-websites-from-tracking-your-moves-online/\n\nSigns that desire for early adoption is high: \nhttps://www.macrumors.com/how-to/prevent-apps-from-tracking-you-across-sites-ios/\n\nApples self-claimed results:\nhttps://searchads.apple.com/\n\nios14 is proclaimed to fuck small businesses, marketers and e-commerce. That is the single biggest Zoomer and Millennial workforce collective in America. With this change, businesses can no longer target any iPhone user after they\u2019ve visited their website while using the trigger of the ad that they visited the website.\n\nIe, you visit a red shoe page. You forget about it. Tomorrow you see an ad for a red shoe.\n\nOr, you look at concerts online in Austin. Then you get distracted and don\u2019t do anything. And then you get an ad for a discount to a concert the next time you\u2019re browsing.\n\nNo more ads like that with ios14. That is dangerous because 80% of the digital marketing budget is devoted to remarketing and retargeting efforts (across the entire industry)\n\nSo, that\u2019s concerning to me because while we can convert customers that have visited the website of Our company and that knows who we are, we make 9.7x what we spend on ads. But, with raw new first time interaction we see a return of .43x. This update will essentially fuck all the small businesses that have put in the time to build their marketing structure around Facebook, and even more so removes the ability for e-commerce to use this as their primary driving factor as e-commerce has an even worse initial introduction return but retargeting they make bank.\n\nSimply put, all ads have to be written like you have no idea who exactly you\u2019re talking to beyond a few details of their interests. You lose all ability to check if they are interested or even know about your company based off non-Facebook interactions. With this, Facebook interactions aren\u2019t even valid anymore due to their far right audience consuming a 76% majority of their usage, you result in clients that are legit fucked. So you have to limit your buyer persona a ton and in turn your average ad cost will be raised significantly as it has for the last year as costs have eclipsed an all time high of being ~400% higher than last year.\n\nAll in all, you\u2019d now spend $15000 for the same thing you would\u2019ve paid $900 for previously (unless you\u2019re part of the .00001% of FB advertisers). Due to the increased costs of Facebooks bottom line but also because of all these other factors combining to make it harder to even find the person you want, much less be given the time needed to convince them.\n\nWhile tracking isn\u2019t the nail in the coffin, the further downsides of Facebook remove further value. This isn\u2019t about Facebook though. This is to show that Apple is making an incredibly, multi-industry impacting move with an attempt to bring Facebook to a 0% market share of iPhone users.\n\nWhy the fuck would Apple do this? They would never hurt their brand. They would never make a dumb money decision. They are the biggest company on the NYSE and that didn\u2019t happen by making off the cuff decisions nor did that happen because of a \u201cprivacy play\u201d Apple has realistically taken as much of the market as they can while touting privacy as their primary benefit to buy an iPhone.\n\nWith this Facebook filed an antitrust lawsuit that is literally going to create a War Between Giants. This very well may be the single largest business brawl ever seen. The number one most valuable company in America that\u2019s geared to fight the number four most valuable.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well typically, Apple will stay hush-hush since they aren\u2019t making the move for publicity or branding. That\u2019s not what happened this time. Instead, as soon as Apple was asked for a comment they stated they\u2019d be fighting it.\n\nFollowing this, Facebook sends out an email at 3:00am talking about the impacts this will have on all Facebook advertisers. They were burning the midnight oil and they decided fear was the best way to motivate the Facebook advertisers. Fuck Facebook for that tbh.\n\nWell, Facebook has a secret solution. They can basically bundle an internet browser into Facebook and just serve the ads through there. Suddenly, they can track you again because suddenly you are never technically leaving Facebook. This is sketchy as fuck and is a simple one-line fix for Apple to again remove this ability. Like a game of cat and mouse as Apple plugs Facebooks bullshit side skirt attempts.\n\nAdditionally, Apple doesn\u2019t historically allow skirts as you can see in the most recent time Apple denied a product that competed with a market they are in: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation and this move was super controversial. \n\nWant another example? Maybe a high profile one? Well Apple said fuck Epic Games and went for the jugular when they straight up removed Fortnite and all Epic Games products from the App Store. They straight up murdered another billion dollar company and Apple didn\u2019t even get scratched. Literally said \u201cfuck off, you can come back when you will pay your bill\u201d\n\nApple didn\u2019t care. They were going to get their money whether the company or retail investors cared. Apple is going to get paid when you\u2019re on their platform.\n\nBut currently Facebook pays Apple $100 a year to list their app. That\u2019s it. They don\u2019t get a cut of ad share. Nothing. So Apple can monetize these small companies making millions but can\u2019t take a cent from the fourth largest company in America. That\u2019s not something they\u2019re gonna be chill about especially as Facebook continues to damage their own reputation. You\u2019ve seen Apple swing once with ios14 and you\u2019ll soon see Apple swing with punch two.\n\nBut before punch two could even happen, Facebook files an anti-trust lawsuit and tries convincing their advertises with that 3am email to support the lawsuit. Uh oh. Must be hot in the walls of Facebook.\n\nSo why would Apple finally pull the trigger?\n\nBecause for years they\u2019ve been building a secret digital marketing ad delivery platform. Where\u2019s it been tested? In the App Store and they are currently sitting at a 50% conversion rate on average. That means one of two people that see an ad, download the app from that ad.\n\nThat is fucking crazy numbers as Homeer is currently sitting at 3%. That\u2019s a  16x difference. That means we could theoretically pay 16x less due to the difference in their ad delivery model or potentially see 16x the amount of impressions.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference that makes Apple so different? They don\u2019t want to spend your whole budget unless they\u2019ve found the perfect person. With Apple, you can set a maximum budget of $10,000 a month currently. Facebook currently has small e-commerce shops spending multi-millions a month. In the App Store, there is a ton of money left on the table currently but that\u2019s not the juicy bit here. The juicy bit is that for the last years they\u2019ve been testing and building this platform while also updating all user experience with Apple products. Finally, Apple has reached 100% control of the apps found and used on their phone, but what they don\u2019t control is the ads inside those apps.\n\nThe five obvious big plays here.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Mobile game ads\n\nGame ads have become a meme about how bad they are. Additionally, they are essentially the very last item that can give Apple a bad look while also largely deceiving the users of iPhones. You know how bad they are. An additional upside to this is that not only does Apple look better as a whole, but this is before you consider that suddenly small businesses would have access to an even deeper level of targeting.\n\nImagine now, I know my perfect client is 34, has two kids and plays candy crush before she goes to bed. Well finally I can run ads under that scenario without having to go through some shady venue while also maintaining the trust aspect.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ads for kids\n\nFinally parents can prevent their kids from seeing unregulated ads. Honestly, I can\u2019t give example of revenue benefits here but this does help early adoption and public support a fuck ton.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Safe for work toggle\n\nFinally, we can have not safe for work ads for those that opt-in. Alternatively, this would function as SFW only but this is again, just another public perception possibility.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Apple News \n\nNow, Apple has been going hard after news apps for the last year. Why would they do this? Because they have Apple News but it\u2019s not monetized by Apple currently. Again, they have third party providers displaying ads that Apple gets zero share of.\n\nBut oh don\u2019t worry, soon Apple will finally monetize all of their software because they have ads running in every platform imaginable.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Privacy\n\nAnother major benefit is that we can deliver high quality ads as business, will get better ads as consumers all while maintaining the fine line of quality and privacy.\n\nNow, ignoring all of that, Apple has seen a moving average growth of 50% YoY for the last four years. They have a solid growth path with products and for the last two years they\u2019ve built their cloud platform to not only consume massive amounts of data, but also process that data. Just look at how they can now search through all of your photos instantly and show you them instantly without a single bit of that photo data being physically on your phone. They are geared to the fucking tits on software innovation and no one even cares.\n\nTo put it in perspective, Apple introducing an ad delivery platform with 50% avg. conversion rate would be like the day Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone.\n\nSecretly for years they\u2019ve worked towards this moment and they finally swung first in a fight.\n\nEven without ads I fully expect them to hit the target of $165 by the end of the year while reaching $220 safely at the end of 2023.\n\nRealistically, business adoption will take at least 8 months before Apple sees enough profit to even recoup the cost of the lawsuit, but this would be the single largest business pivot ever seen in the world.\n\nSo if Apple goes from a product business to a software business what does that mean for their value? Let\u2019s look at Stripe since we have recent data and we know what they\u2019re doing has the same kind of user life-changing benefits.\n\nStripe does $450 million in revenue. They were just valued at $115 billion. That\u2019s a P/E ratio of 255%\n\nCurrently, the P/E ratio of Apple is 34% so not only do I expect them to land in the high middle range of the two, I also additionally expect never before seen returns for an ad company. Not because they have the largest audience but because they can genuinely show your ad to the exact person you want.\n\nFrom a business perspective, digital marketing is entirely about quality over quantity when it comes to potential consumer eyes and this would be the very first ad platform to operate with this ideal.\n\nFinally, Apple is currently underperforming and is trading on rumor of a bullshit electric car and is sliding, all while literally no one on the internet has considered the idea that they\u2019re doing all this because they\u2019re introducing an ad platform that will soon print billions of profit within months of releasing.\n\nNow finally we can cover the aspect that we don\u2019t have to try and time them developing and releasing this. They already tested it, got crazy fucking results and no one bats an eye. Everyone is so consumed by Facebook they totally missed the play Apple just made.\n\nThere\u2019s a major war brewing and it\u2019s only begun. But we\u2019ve all watched the idea that all media is good media be proven true as Robinhood received 3.5 billion in funding during the biggest retail investor controversy in modern day. Regardless initial interaction, Apple investors don\u2019t get scared by that. Apple investors are Apple investors because they know they will bring hell to earth before they accept not getting a cut of the money.\n\nThis company is down on the month incredibly and there has never been a better time to buy Apple IMO while being prepared to hold for about 8 months for potentially a massive, massive payout. This is not an option we will sell quickly. This is a weather the storm and wait for the announcement to set into reality.\n\nDisclaimer that this is pure personal intuition and this idea came from nowhere but my ass and Facebook sent the email literally Monday so this is as hot off the press it can be.\n\nAll this to say, people like targeted marketing both businesses and consumers but not when it\u2019s in Facebook hands. \n\nWhat company in the entire market is most trusted to do right by the consumer while delivering an incredible cost at likely a higher cost to those paying while also maintaining 100% of their self-made market? Apple.\n\nI am jacked on 3/17/23 @ 190 for 10.60\n\nEdit: due to an awesome fucking user we now know they are hiring a massive amount of jobs for their ad platforms: https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=Client%20Partner%20Manager-%20Search%20Ads&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;location=united-states-USA\n\nHere\u2019s the snippet: \n&amp;gt; \u201cThe Ad Platforms EPM team is looking for a highly-functioning, self-driven, and versatile leader who can manage a team of EPMs to drive our site reliability projects. These projects are key to our overall operations and business growth. You will own delivery responsibilities on projects that seek to build out scalable platforms and reliable infrastructure for core systems and applications across heterogeneous environments. This will happen while also adhering to the highest levels of privacy and security that Apple holds. You will be responsible for leading and mentoring your team to work through project dependencies, risks, and deliver measurable outcomes against timelines - in a fast-paced environment!\u201d\n\nWhile these may not all be for their *new* platform there is definitely jobs created on Feb. 19 that bring a different tone.",

        "selftext": "Hi, been a while. WSB has gone through the drain in the past month, with all the retarded \"ape together strong\" and other newbie saying bullshit.\n\n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b who joined solely on the squeeze thesis spreading FUD that anyone who hasn't sold at this point is left \"holding the bag\" because GameStop is a $0 company (according to them).\n\nI've come to smack some sense into everyone here. This sub has changed sentiment from \"being about sending a message\" to \"let's find the next stock to pump guys, look it's 50 cents per share / look it's weed / look it's shorted / if we all buy we can get rich\" dumb shit.\n\nGameStop was always a value play to begin with. Ignore the Wall Street \"analysts\" who say it's overvalued and $20 is fair price. Just a month ago they were saying $20 was too high and had an average fair value of $13. Historically they've been off the ball more often than not. Sure they'll correct it afterwards when it's already higher and you got jack shit from their price valuation. If it dips to $20 that dip will be bought right back up before you can say \"I'm retarded\".\n\nI'm not going to rehash the DD on why GameStop is a good hold long term. If you're interested, check out some of the posts prior to January on GME. It'll be a bit hard with all the dogshit trash posts that got thousands and thousands of upvotes, but if you care enough, it's out there for you to find. \n\nSo, why is it undervalued now? Well, even with it being a $3,6B company as of writing this, it's STILL been described and seen as a dying brick and mortar retail chain with little life left in it (a last cigars puff if you will). Not only the media, but also the general public as a whole has this opinion. That is currently priced into the valuation of GameStop. Especially if we look at the still insanely high 78% SI.\n\nAnd that's where they're dead wrong. GameStop is far from dying, in fact they're silently transitioning towards digital, e-commerce and building a brand new business. \n\nOnce people realise this the base line price for GameStop will be a $10B cap at the very least. Poised for standing front and center in the booming industry that is gaming. \n\n\"Oh but Amazon/Microsoft/Steam blablabla\" I hear you say. None of them fill the huge void (or can fill the void) that there currently is. Why can't they? Because it doesn't fit their business model, and to make it fit would require a lot more restructuring and changes to their already successful business. A risk not worth taking. GameStop, on the other hand,  doesn't have this problem, it literally can only go up from this point. \n\nLike many have said, even without the squeeze you're sitting on a golden opportunity. Think Apple pre-iPhone. *This is my own opinion, bla bla bla, not financial advice.*\n\nAnd for the people who even suggest pumping the stock (or any for that matter); you're the scum of the earth. Go find another place to make your little schemes.\n\nI've seen people making posts about selling shares to get options instead so that you can create a gamma squeeze. Literally the dumbest thing you can do and exactly what the shorts would want. Get rid of the only thing you hold that has any inherent value (which you could hold forever) and trade that for a lottery ticket with an expiration date. \n\nFurthermore GME is unique. Its industry setting, its turnaround plan, the short interest all make it a one of a kind situation. AMC, NOK, BB etc all got caught up in the meme spike when WSB gained massive media attention. Long term they might do alright, but none of them hold a candle to the potential of GME.\n\nPosition: over 1000 shares @$16- Yes, I held throughout the rise. Guess who else held? Alan Attal for one (board member that joined with Ryan Cohen) who had 150k shares bought @&lt;$20 or for roughly $2,5MM *could* have sold at the peak for over $70MM. So yes, even though I could have made over  HALF A MILLION $ gain, I didn't. \n\nI see the future potential of GameStop, and it is **bright**. I'm going to be part of that future. So I'm holding. And buying this dip.\n\nTL;DR: I'm holding because I like the stock.",

        "selftext": "**$TM Toyota Motors**\n\n\\*\\*Full disclosure: I own 75k in Toyota calls. I also own a Porsche and Audi (no Toyota products). I\u2019m also not good with investing. So don\u2019t listen to me.\n\nWow, some of the best plays truly are right in front of you, because Toyota is hilariously undervalued now that they\u2019ve decided to enter the EV market.\n\nToyota, is an engineering and business legend. Nobody engineers better than Toyota, nobody optimizes businesses and Toyota. \n\nWhen I went through business school we studied Toyota in almost ever classroom. Toyota practically invented modern business practices and engineering practices.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Toyota as a professional in business or engineering, you should probably be fired.\n\nThe following statements may sound like opinions, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re facts. \n\n\\- Dominates the manufacturing supply practice. Nothing is wasted in Toyota\u2019s business, everything runs **LEAN and AGILE.** During economic downturns Toyota will always come out on top simply  because they\u2019ve **perfected** the art of **efficiency**.\n\n\\- The finest engineers work at Toyota. Everything Toyota produces is an engineering marvel. Products optimized perfectly for each single demographic to be as affordable and reliable as possible  while being practice. \n\nToday, Toyota officially entered the EV business. The company with a perfect supply chain, the company with the highest amount of consumer trust, the company that has the finest engineers in the entire automotive industry and a practically infinite amount of wealth\u2026has entered the room. So let\u2019s look at their positioning.\n\n\\- Toyota is bound to be a huge recipient of the Biden\u2019s plan to supply the federal government with EVs.\n\n\\- Fun fact, the top \u201cAmerican\u201d companies are asian. The big three make most of their junk abroad.\n\n\\- Toyota is planning on being the **first** to deploy the **SOLID STATE BATTERY.** \n\n**- MASSIVE Energy density** compared to existing technology. \n\n\\- Solid state batteries can easily reach **500+ mile range.** \n\n\\- **Much** faster charge time.\n\n\\- Have already begun the production \n\n\\- Toyota plans on unveiling the first solid state powered EV this year with release soon after.\n\n\\- Toyota produces over 10,000,000 vehicles a year. Tesla reached 500,000 this year with a goal of 20% growth a year.\n\n\\- Toyota is the most trusted brand internationally in the automotive world.\n\nSo Toyota, a manufacturing behemoth is switching to fully electric with aims of putting their world class engineers to produce the world\u2019s first solid state battery commercial vehicle. Nice.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about some numbers:\n\n\\- Price to book ratio of 1.137. Anything under 3 is considered undervalued. Tesla is around 40.\n\n\\- PE ratio of 17.17. Anything under 20 is undervalued, Apple is at 37 and **Tesla is 1301.**\n\n**-** Expected to increase margin from 5.5 -&gt; 7.2\n\n \n\n* 121% increase in operating income from China\n* 24% Increase in cash/cash equivalents since Apr 2019. Impressive considering covid\n* Relatively stable/balanced asset/liability ratio, has barely budged since covid).\n* Has somehow decreased cost and expenses by 16% during covid.\n\nIf Tesla is the King Kong of the EV world, then Toyota is Godzilla, a nuclear powered dinosaur of a company from outer space. He\u2019s landed and he\u2019s gonna blow up your bubble. Yes I\u2019m aware of the\n\n\u201cNot just a car company\u201d phrase, but as Burry said, \u201cEnjoy it while it lasts\u201d, because no company should be trading with a century of growth priced in.\n\nTl;dr \n\nToyota is here and it\u2019s going to devour the EV market. Good long term purchase, but I have 75,000$ in calls. \n\nNot a Toyota fanboy( I drive a Porsche and Audi). Don't take my advice.",

He also noted spikes in usage for ESPN+ (up 83% to 12.1 million) and Hulu (up 30% to 35.4 million).\n\nDisney\u2019s Media and Entertainment Distribution, which includes Disney+, brought in $12.66 billion for the quarter, a decline of 5% from the same quarter a year ago before the pandemic swept across the country. The Disney Parks, Experiences and Products unit took in $3.6 billion, down 53% year-over-year as many Disney parks and its cruise line remain closed. The flagship Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Calif., and Disneyland Paris will stay closed in the current quarter, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said during the analyst call.\n\nThe sustained strength of Disney+ has impressed Wall Street analysts despite stiffening competition from Apple Inc.\u2019s [AAPL](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote) Apple TV+, Netflix Inc.

        "selftext": "I feel this post was necessary due to all the people I saw on here recently talking about money they lost. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Guide on HOW TO ANALYZE &amp; RESEARCH A STOCK/ How to do a thorough due diligence/ DD \\[Due Diligence 101\\]:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the things I look at when evaluating a stock. (This is my checklist just build from years of wins &amp; losses, things I learned from Pace University and Goldman Sachs). Usually a good due diligence (DD)/ research can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours. If I am investing large amounts of cash, I want to research thoroughly, so if the stock drops I can stick to my convictions, and forget about emotion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I use my time to research a stock, and read up about it into detail, and dig into the financials, news, 10-Q/ 10-K, etc., I:\n\n1. I look at **price upside**. I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the price targets. (Money is a tool, and you want it to work for you). MarketBeat.com can show you this: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/price-targe](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/price-target)t/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I look at the **charts and the technicals**. I try to read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? A site you can use to interpret the charts for you is BarChart.com and TradingView.com.\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/opinion](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/opinion)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-AAPL/technicals/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-AAPL/technicals/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If it passes these, then I dig deeper.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other things I look at:**\n\n1. I dig deeper into **technical analysis and the charts.** I look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc.\n2. **Sentiment &amp; News**. What are people saying? Google the company.\n3. **Earnings &amp; revenue history.** Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the projections\n4. **Growth**. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth.\n5. **Financial health**. Are the financials strong? (Quick ratio, Profit margin, EPS, Income Statement Trend, Cashflow).\n6. **Valuations**. How is this valuated? (PEG ratio, P/E ratio)\n7. **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it?\n8. **What is the put/call ratio?** Are people betting against this stock?\n9. **Peers &amp; competition**. How does this company stack up against its competitors and peers? How do the financials compare? How to the products compare? Is there a moat?\n10. **Institutional Sponsorship.** Are big banks and wall street holding this? How much or this companys stock do they hold?\n11. **Insider Trading**. Is the CEO buying or selling shares?\n12. The amount of **ETFs** that hold this stock. Will they continue to buy it up and drive price?\n13. **Average volume** traded. Is this stock liquid? Would I be able to get my money back? How easy can I trade it.\n14. **Social sentiment**. I check what people are saying on twitter and google search trends.\n15. **News moves a stock.** So I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are many sites you can use to dig into a stock such as (1) Yahoo Finance, (2) MarketBeat.com, (3) MacroTrends.com, (4) MarketWatch.com, (5) CNNMoney.com, (6) [CNBC.com](https://CNBC.com)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI use an excel spreadsheet to organize my research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you see, good research and due diligence can take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours. But this is your money, and noone cares more about it than you do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI created a facebook group, discord, tiktok, instagram and youtube to share more things like this.

Apple has some of the highest margins (seem to be only increasing), insane revenue (they are still growing), good moat (its a hardware company basically), immune to monopoly regulation (they only control like what? 6% of the entire smartphone market?), great marketing, and have a lot of vertical integration (iMessage, Apple m1, iCloud, Apple Card, Apple one, etc). They also have shit ton of cash (they can buy Netflix full on the spot basically), and assets (their headquarters is roughly worth around $5B for example). Lastly, they have a lot of room to grow because they are so far from a monopoly, and they going into other areas where they can dominate (Apple Car, Apple card, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade+). \n\nHere are the other areas they dominate: Apple iPad, and Apple Watch. Nothing comes close to competitors. \n\nThe only area where I can see apple failing is if they just keep riding the wave, and get lazy with their product innovations (you can argue this is already happening). However, after the latest apple chip, and the amount of cash they have, they got to be failing a lot and for a long time for Apple to be in any bad spot. Hence, it's a safe bet in my eyes with a decent amount of upside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like the stock. A lot.",

        "selftext": "**__$HUT - A Safe Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunity Amidst Crazy Valuations - Hut8 Bull Thesis__**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' fellas, it's your resident ape gang professor Flux, here to lay down some knowledge. You may remember me from my AT&amp;T short term bull thesis where I managed to call the pop on AT&amp;T two days before it did, and helped a bunch of dudes \"risklessly\" bag upwards of 180%. This is my second attempt at writing DD, and I feel like I may have gotten a little lost in the sauce in this one, so I left midway TLDRs for people to read in case they don't really give a fuck about the nitty gritty. All that being said, buckle the fuck in, this is a long one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##__Introduction__\n\nI'm going to preface this by saying that I am *not* particularly fond of Bitcoin as a whole. I fuckin hate magic internet money. That being said, there are people who are way fuckin' smarter than me who are insanely bullish on it, and with major companies like Paypal, Tesla, and Apple starting to grab some, as well as major institutions like Blackrock starting to dabble in it, it would be stupid to ignore completely. For the time being, Bitcoin is here to stay, and although I despise it, I know that there's money to be made. Investor euphoria is at all time highs, with the price of mining companies rapidly outpacing and diverging from Bitcoin its self. After watching Riot Blockchain run up from a penny stock, to 3$, to 15$, to 30$, to now fucking 70$, you better believe I'm not passing up ***another*** opportunity to make some coin. If you want some exposure to Bitcoin in your portfolio, without paying fuckin' 70$ for $RIOT, you've come to the right place. Enter, Hut8.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__What is Bitcoin Mining?__**\n\nBefore we get started, I need to lay down a few key concepts. In layman's terms, Bitcoin Mining is the process of creating new Bitcoin by solving a computational puzzle. The result of Bitcoin mining is twofold. First, when computers solve these complex math problems on the blockchain, they produce new Bitcoin. Second, by solving computational math problems, Bitcoin miners make the Bitcoin payment network trustworthy and secure by verifying transaction information.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo mine a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a [nonce] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce). This number is extremely difficult to get, and there's no easy way to cheese it ; Miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result. The brute force method is extremely time consuming and computationally expensive, as you are literally trying every combination out there to get the SINGLE one that works. \"C'mon Flux, How many combinations could there possibly be\", you ask? A fuckload. A mega shitton. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's estimated that the total hash rate of the entire Bitcoin network is currently sitting at roughly [151 million TH's](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate). That's 151 million, TRILLION nonces attempted, per SECOND. On average, the network ensures that it takes roughly 10 minutes to mine a block, so we can multiply 151 million trillion by 600 to get our answer. That's **9*10^22**, or **900000000000000000000000** different combinations attempted, to crack the block, grab your coin, and move onto the next one. And it's only getting *more* difficult. The network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks. The aim is to keep the mining times consistent at 1 block per 10 minutes. Therefore, if mining power is doubled, difficulty would also get doubled.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Rise of the ASIC__**\n\nBack in the day, any schmuck could mine Bitcoin and turn a slight profit on their personal computer. With the insane increase in hashing power, you actually end up losing more money to electricity costs than you would make mining, by a factor of 10. This was largely in part, due to some real smart mfs inventing what is known as the ASIC miner.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Back in 2013, people started developing ASIC chips specifically designed to brute force the SHA-256 function, and find nonces. These chips are unbelievably good at what they do, with even a shitty chip being a factor of 100 times faster than your standard PC. ASIC miners are used by all Bitcoin mining operations, and it's important to know the costs, and overhead before we proceed. One final thing to note, is that Bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in Bitcoin. This is due to the \"lag\" that occurs while new Bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture this excess profit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNowadays, the average [top of the line ASIC miner](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A) can generate roughly 110 tera-hashes per second. That's 110 Trillion attempts at finding the nonce, *per second*.Top mining companies run a fuckload of these miners in tandem, to get a couple of thousand *peta-hashes* per seconds. For reference, one peta-hash is equal to 1000 tera-hashes, meaning that companies running at 1000 peta-hashes are actually running at one million tera hashes, per second. One million, trillion hashes per second. Fucking unreal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs far as we're concerned, at current day conditions, if you're mining at 1000pH/s, you're generating 4000 Bitcoins per year. Obviously, this is far from reality as global mining power will increase, but keep this number in mind, as it's important. 1000pH/s = 4000 coins mined in a year.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Midway TLDR :** Under current conditions, mining Bitcoin at a rate of 1000 peta-hashes will generate roughly 4000 Bitcoins per year. 4000 Bitcoin * $50,000 USD = $200,000,000\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# **__Calculating Growth and Profit Margins among Mining Companies__**\n\nNow that we've got some basic knowledge of how Bitcoin mining works, as well as the general profits we can expect from it, it's time to start crunching some raw numbers for each mining company. I will focus on the general profitability of each company, how many coins each company has the potential to mine in a given year, and how many coins does each company have on hand. In this DD, I will be providing analysis on three different mining companies; $RIOT, $MARA, and the secret dark horse, $HUT.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__$RIOT__**\n\nHas been around since July 2000 doing nothing relevant. It formally became Riot Blockchain in October 2017, and has been focused on its Bitcoin mining operations since. Riot Blockchain is now partnered with Coinmint LLC, from New York, who is responsible for operating the miners. They apparently get electricity for around $0.01/kWh, which is absurdly cheap.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [456 pH/s](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/RIOT-Q/pressreleases/974231/). Under current conditions, they are set to mine a little under 2000 Bitcoin this year. They are waiting on a shitload of new miners to come in, which will effectively raise their hashing power to 842 pH/s at some point in Q1, and then 1446 pH/s by the start of Q2. \n\n- In December 2020, when their stock price rocketed alongside Bitcoin, they took advantage of this and ran a [secondary offering which raised $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm). They used $35m of this money to pay for the new miners.\n\n- They hold 830 self-mined Bitcoins.\n\n- They currently have $150m in liquid assets (Cash + Bitcoin), due to the secondary offering.\n\n- $RIOT is trading at 78$ per share, with a market cap of 5.3 *billion* dollars\n\n- [Up 1800% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://imgur.com/VjQTaA3)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# **__$MARA__**\n\nThis company is kind of a fucking fiesta. It first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium when it was first founded in 2010, then changed its mind and started fucking with real estate in Southern California, and most recently, has started patent trolling. I have no idea *when* they started dabbling in Bitcoin, but in 2019 they ordered a shitload of miners, so we can only assume that's about the time they got into the mining business.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [258 pH/s](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MARA/pressreleases/1151711/). The did however, order new miners like RIOT did, and once those arrive, they'll be mining at a cool 688 pH/s. Under current speeds, they are projected to mine 1000 Bitcoin this year.\n\n- Similar to RIOT, they also did a [secondary offering in December, raising $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.html). With this money, they ordered even more miners.\n\n- Just last month, they ran ANOTHER secondary offering, and raised $300m. They used this money to purchase 4,800 Bitcoin at $31,000USD per coin.\n\n- As a result, MARA has 4800 Bitcoins held, fresh off the press.\n\n- Since then, they've made $90m off of their Bitcoin purchases, leaving them with roughly $240m in liquid assets.\n\n- $MARA is trading at 48$ per share, with a market cap of 4.5 *billion* dollars\n\n- [Up 1450% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://imgur.com/wwzoTn6)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__$HUT__**\nHut 8 is one of Canada's oldest and largest Bitcoin miners, providing value for investors through extremely low production costs, and appreciation of Bitcoin inventory. Their mining operation is self run and located in Alberta, allowing for significantly less overhead costs due to self management, cheaper energy, and colder climates.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [**1073 pH/s**](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hut-8-mining-bitcoin-holdings-surpass-3-012-valued-at-186m-cad-804326405.html). This puts them ahead of most other mining operations by a landslide. Similar to the others, Hut 8 is looking to expand its' mining operation by adding more miners, bringing up their total hashrate to around [1500 pH/s](https://hut8mining.com/hut-8-finalizes-11-8-million-equipment-financing-loan-from-dcg-subsidiary-foundry).\n\n- Hut 8 holds 3000 self-mined Bitcoins on hand. 17% of their entire market cap is made up solely from the Bitcoin that they hold.\n\n- Out of the 3000 coins that they hold, 1000 of them are held in a Genesis savings account, generating a 4% yield, increasing their generated revenues from Bitcoin appreciation.\n\n- Currently possess $190m in liquid assets.\n\n- $HUT is trading around 9$ per share, with a market cap of 900 million dollars.\n\n- [Up around 500% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZOvgAju/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Midway TLDR #2 :** $HUT out performs $RIOT and $MARA in every metric, but is only trading at 9$ opposed to 70$ and 50$ respectively.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__So... What Gives?__**\n\nComparing Hut 8's raw numbers to Mara and Riot, it's a night and day difference. Hut 8 has an astronomically greater amount of hashing power compared to its' competitors, meaning that it generates more coins on a day to day basis. Furthermore, Hut 8 is also holding 3000 Bitcoins that it self-mined, allowing them to reap the rewards of the appreciating price of Bitcoin. Riot has less than one third that amount, and Mara has **bought** 4,800 of its' Bitcoins, meaning they literally paid (lost) money to acquire them. Furthermore, Hut 8 also has fewer expenses and a much healthier [balance sheet](https://hut8mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hut-8-FS-Q3-2020-v3.pdf) overall compared to its peers. Hut 8 mines faster, holds more, and is in a much better financial state than leaders in the industry. I believe that Hut 8 is **criminally** undervalued when compared to other companies in the same sector.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Minor Factors Holding Hut 8 Back__**\n\nThere are simply two factors which I believe are holding Hut 8 back. The first of which, is the lack of publicity. Up until last week, I straight up didn't know Hut 8 even existed. Furthermore, I can guarantee you that until this post, *you* also didn't know that Hut 8 existed. Hell, the only two blockchain related tickers I knew of were $RIOT, and $MARA. Hut 8 is relatively unknown, and once the mainstream catches wind of it, it'll likely pop just as hard as its peers.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe second setback, comes from the exchange Hut 8 is traded on, the TSE. Many investors don't care to look to, or don't have access to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. As a result, even if they wanted to trade on the TSE, they are limited. Hut 8 also happens to trade OTC, but those exchanges are even less popular than the TSE. Regardless, since many don't have access to the TSE, they can't buy in, even if they desperately wanted to.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Hut 8 Bull Thesis and the Ultimate Catalyst__**\nRegardless of the minimal downsides, **what we have here is an awesome financial arbitrage opportunity.** A company that substantially outperforms its peers is trading at a maximum of 20% of its competitors value. Hut 8 is an absolute steal right now. Furthermore, it also hasn't run yet. It's only increased around 450% in relation to Bitcoin's 200% rise. Its peers have run 2000% and 1450% respectively, meaning Hut 8 has lots of room for growth. Hut 8 also has a hidden catalyst which could help the stock truly explode.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that it is important for Hut 8 to get listed on  the Nasdaq. The difference in liquidity between US-listed $MARA and $RIOT vs $HUT is a staggering 100x. Numerous investors would be delighted to buy into the Hut 8 story but are currently unable to do so due to liquidity concerns. Nasdaq markets are much bigger and more liquid than that of the TSE, and listing on Nasdaq will open up the floodgates in regards to demand for the stock. In addition, listing on the Nasdaq will greatly enhance Hut 8\u2019s visibility and brand among US and international investors. A Nasdaq listing would be the ultimately catalyst for Hut 8, as more people would know about it, *and* more people would invest in it. There have been some rumblings and rumors about a Nasdaq uplisting for Hut 8, but  when asked, Hut 8 officials vehemently ignore all remarks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Bitcoin Bear Thesis__**\nWe've come to the point in the DD where the music stops, and the rainbows fade. Sure, as undervalued as Hut 8 is compared to its' peers, we still need to remember, that we're talking about Bitcoin mining companies. These companies are fundamentally dogshit. You're literally paying the executive team of RIOT/MARA/HUT to buy an ASIC miner, plug it in, and sell any Bitcoin for you. That's fuckin' it. You could literally do what these guys do by yourself. You're literally paying a premium to indirectly get exposure to Bitcoin. Long term, and as far as future earnings go, this play is likely a loser. Unfortunately, the market doesn't care for the fundamentals, and we can exploit it. Bitcoin has passed $50k, and the narrative says that its going to $100k. It's all sunshine and rainbows.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRemember earlier in the article, when I said that as Bitcoin price goes up, mining becomes VERY profitable? As a result, there is, and always will be a rush to deploy more hardware. This is literally proven by the order book of the above companies. Remember 2017? When Bitcoin ran from 4,000 to 20,000 in a matter of months? The total overall hash-rate only increased by about 60%, compared to the 500% increase in the coin itself. Wonderful stuff. Can you guess what happened after? Hash-rate went up an astronomical [681%](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) over the course of the following months, decimating profit margins as new miners were produced and deployed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm not trying to sound all doom and gloom like the world is ending, but I also don't want any of you to get caught with your pants around your ankles.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Conclusion__**\nAlthough I dislike this sector with a passion, I enjoy making free money enough to look past it. Compared to its' peers, Hut 8 is criminally undervalued. It does everything its' competitors do, only better, and it does it all while maintaining a better balance sheet. Furthermore, the \"blockchain\" sector is on fucking fire, with retail euphoria, and institutional money flowing in like a river. This presents us with an incredibly unique financial arbitrage situation, similar to what the homie Warren Buffet used to do back in the 1600s or someshit. Buy Hut 8, hold it, and wait for the mainstream media to catch wind of it to cash in on your tendies. Make sure you have a solid exit strategy in place, cause when the music stops, it's gonna be a bloodbath. If you wish to connect with me, or get my DD before it hits Reddit, you can join my Discord, or follow me on Twitter. Links can be found on my profile. I love you all, and I wish you all bountiful gains.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**TLDR**\n\n$HUT presents us with a minimal risk financial arbitrage opportunity. It is criminally undervalued compared to its peers, while doing everything its' competitors can do, but better. It currently trades on the TSE and OTC markets, but there's talks about it being uplisted to the NASDAQ, where it will explode in popularity and exposure, resulting in its price inflating to RIOT/MARA levels.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**__TLDR of TLDR :__** Buy $HUT on the TSE or $HUTMF on OTC markets. No, it doesn't have options. Yes, you can still count on a modest 400% return.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**__Sources__**\n\n\u2022 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce\n\n\u2022 https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate\n\n\u2022 https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/RIOT-Q/pressreleases/974231/\n\n\u2022 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm\n\n\u2022 https://imgur.com/VjQTaA3\n\n\u2022 https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MARA/pressreleases/1151711/\n\n\u2022 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.htm\n\n\u2022 https://imgur.com/wwzoTn6\n\n\u2022 https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hut-8-mining-bitcoin-holdings-surpass-3-012-valued-at-186m-cad-804326405.html\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/hut-8-finalizes-11-8-million-equipment-financing-loan-from-dcg-subsidiary-foundry\n\n\u2022 https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZOvgAju/\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hut-8-FS-Q3-2020-v3.pdf\n\n\u2022 https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/",

        "selftext": " AppHarvest is a publicly traded Indoor Farming based in the US. While there are several other in door farming companies like Gotham Greens and AeroFarms, APPH is the only one of the bunch that is publicly traded. Indoor farming, IMO is the future, and there currently is no dominant company like Tesla, Amazon, Apple in the AggTech Space. APPH only has a market cap of $4B. **Investing in APPH will not only position you for the future, but also allow you to capitalize on the sustainability movement**.\n\nThe market share of indoor farms in the total aggriculture market is very small, giving lots of room for growth. Indoor farming only produces 14B of goods compared to 400b of production in US.  **At a market cap of 4B, I bought APPH for the growth potential and my belief that there will one day be a dominant Aggtech player and that indoor farms will take over farming in the future**.\n\nAPPH is based in Kentucky. The founder, Jonathan Webb grew up in Kentucky and went to University of Kentucky. It makes me feel like he's in this for the long haul and wants to give back to the community there. Webb has aspirations to make Kentucky the Aggtech capital of USA. Kentucky is also a strategic location in that it has cheap land and access to rain water.\n\nSo why indoor farming:\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Benefits Of Indoor Farming**: This is pretty self explanatory but I will name a few\n\n* **Less use of water**: APPH and other indoor farms claim to use 90% less water than conventional farms. [https://www.appharvest.com/](https://www.appharvest.com/)\n* **Can grow year round**\n* **Not dependent on climate**\n* **Can be done vertically to take up less space**\n* **Can be grown without the use of pesticides** \\- decreasing chemicals released\n\nIn a nutshell, Indoor Farming is the way of the future. With climate change, outdoor farming has become unpredictable. Much of US farming is only able to sell their goods for so cheap due to subsidies. Fresh water is also decreasing and desalination is expensive. [https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170412-is-the-world-running-out-of-fresh-water](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170412-is-the-world-running-out-of-fresh-water) The human population continues to grow and food shortages is a legitimate problem - hence some companies are looking into bugs as the protein of the future. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/climate/climate-change-food-supply.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/climate/climate-change-food-supply.html) , [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/bug-protein-how-entrepreneurs-are-persuading-americans-to-eat-insects.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/bug-protein-how-entrepreneurs-are-persuading-americans-to-eat-insects.html) No matter what the solution is, the fact is, **we need to feed humans and we need to do it in a more efficient way**.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Indoor Farming vs. Conventional Farming**:\n\nCurrently, indoor farming is still a bit more expensive than conventional farming. APPH is selling it's tomatoes as 'organic' which allows it to price it higher. However, the trend is reversing. While outdoor farming continues to face increasing costs due to use of pesticides, climate change, and water costs, indoor farming faces the opposite problem. Many US outdoor farms are only able to sell at cheap prices due to subsidies. Advancements in technology well continue to decrease the costs for indoor farming. Conventional farms also usually are located far from populous areas and will have additional supply chain costs. Indoor farms can be located wherever it makes sense to be located. For more info: [https://www.growcomputer.io/blog/2020/3/9/change-in-agriculture](https://www.growcomputer.io/blog/2020/3/9/change-in-agriculture)\n\nCosts of indoor farming include the initial investment cost of building the facility. After that, the main repeat cost is electricity to power the led lamps. However, it is still sustainable after electric costs: [https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/post/is-vertical-farming-really-sustainable](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/post/is-vertical-farming-really-sustainable) Indoor farms as mentioned see vast reduction in needs for water, pesticides, land area, supply chain, and other costs that traditional farms see.\n\n**Indoor farming is already very successful**. Believe it or night, tiny Neterhlands is one of the worlds largest exporters of vegetables - all due to the their ability to farm indoors. National Geographic did an excerpt here: [https://investinholland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NFIA-National-Geographic-Article\\_final-A4.pdf](https://investinholland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NFIA-National-Geographic-Article_final-A4.pdf) In door farm technology can be used to grow crops anywhere, even in the Sahara.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Indoor Farming Has ALOT of Potential**: Besides what's listed above, indoor farming can leverage AI in making farms automated and increase yield. Tech companies have been investing in indoor farms due to the potential to use technology and AI to increase yield and produce crops. [http://economyleague.org/providing-insight/regional-direction/2018/08/10/the-promise-and-peril-of-vertical-farming](http://economyleague.org/providing-insight/regional-direction/2018/08/10/the-promise-and-peril-of-vertical-farming) Additionally, the US governemnt has been eyeing ways to support indoor farming: [https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2018/08/14/vertical-farming-future](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2018/08/14/vertical-farming-future)\n\nI truely believe, whether or not people like to think in those terms, that water and food will become a scarcer resource in the future. I also truly believe that indoor farming is the future, especially as we as humans look to become more sustainable.\n\nI'm not usually big on celebrity endorsers, but Martha Stewart is firmly behind APPH.

This means it's ripe for a dominant player to show up. All indoor farms should grow and capture some market share from traditional farms.\n\n\\-------------\n\nDisclaimer: I am long APPH.

        "selftext": "Hello options people.  With all the new blood in the options community, I thought it was worthwhile to update my Options guide and re-post it.  It has significantly more content than last time.  This should be really useful for newer traders, I hope it helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent a huge amount of time learning about options and tried to distill my knowledge down into a helpful guide.  This should especially be useful for newbies and growing options traders.\n\nWhile I feel I\u2019m a successful trader, I'm not a guru and my advice is not gospel.  This will hopefully be a good starting point, teach you a lot, improve on your existing skills (if you already know the basics), and make you a better trader.  I plan to keep typing up more info from my notebook, expanding this guide, and posting it every couple months.  \n\nAny feedback or addition requests are appreciated\n\n*Per requests, I added details of good and bad trades I made.  Some painful lessons learned are now included.  I also tried to organize this better as it got longer.*\n\nThis guide has gotten so big it is too long for one reddit post, so now it\u2019s two parts.  I\u2019ll cross-link each post so you can easily jump between.\n\nPart 1 - Beginner, training, links, and concepts focused.\n\nPart 2 - Advanced beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced strategies.\n\n# Here's what I tell options beginners:\n\nI would strongly recommend buying a beginner's options book and read it cover to cover.  That helped me a lot.\n\nI like this beginner book:[ https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GWSXX8U/ref=cm\\_sw\\_r\\_cp\\_apa\\_OxNDFb2GK9YW7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GWSXX8U/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_OxNDFb2GK9YW7)\n\n## Helpful websites:\n\n* Tasty Trade (TT), E-Trade, and Ally Invest have helpful articles and videos.\n* Tasty Trade:\n   * [https://www.tastytrade.com/tt](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt)\n   * [https://www.youtube.com/c/tastytrade1/featured](https://www.youtube.com/c/tastytrade1/featured)\n* Ally Invest training:\n   * What is options trading?

This is imperative since it's attrition when buying and a payout when selling. [ https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)\n* DTE: Days till expiration/expiry\n* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.\n* Understand all the Greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.  The Greeks: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/)\n* Options positions with respect to price:\n   * ITM: In the money; strike is below stock value.\n   * ATM: At the money; strike is just at or above the stock value, often very highly traded.  Can be very effective with moderate - long term expiry.  If the stock moves favorably, an ATM option\u2019s delta will rapidly increase.\n   * NTM: Near the money; strike is above the stock value, but fairly close.  Slightly unofficial term.\n   * OTM: Out of the money; price is at least a few strikes from the current stock price.  I would say 10-30% over stock price.\n   * Very OTM: Not a real definition, this is essentially a lottery ticket.  Cheap, but almost certain to expire worthless unless there is explosive movement.\n* IV, IV crush, and how IV affects pricing.  In general, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when the IV is low.  Increasing  IV is good for held calls/puts.  IV drop or crush is generally good for sellers.\n* Selling options can be quite beneficial.  Once you have a good general understanding, lookup r/thetagang .  Kamikaze Cash has good YouTube videos on most theta strategies (linked above).  I personally believe selling options (especially cash secured) is much safer and can consistently make you profits.  \u0398 Gang 4 life.\n* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!\n* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.\n* Understand that some WSB recommendations are straight up high-risk gambling and factor in that information accordingly.  Be careful with Meme stocks and the survivor-ship bias on YOLO plays.  However, I love the sub and think it\u2019s hilarious.  It has a lot of valuable information / DD if you are comfortable with the \u201ccolorful\u201d language.  It\u2019s also great if you like rocket ship emojis.\n\n## Basics / Mechanics\n\n* Understand the 4 \"main\" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex multi-legged option strategies are based off these in some way (see below)\n* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock or if you own an underlying longer term option; see LEAPS and PMCCs later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and often requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and usually a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life and end up living in a dumpster eating saltine crackers.\n* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold \"naked\" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as increasing risk.\n\n# General Tips and Ideas:\n\n* Don't EVER leave (short) spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)\n* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).  I started trading options with 5k, then 25k, 50k, and later over 100k.  I added my own funds over time and used my gains to build my account.  Don\u2019t go all in immediately, that\u2019s dangerous and unwise.\n* Especially as you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it diversified among several stocks.\n   * Don't go all in on one thing, ever.  Be able to take a hit from one stock and not mortally wound your portfolio.\n   * A company may be doing great, then there's a major product issue out of nowhere.  If you are overexposed in one stock this can really hurt you.\n   * I had to roll options I sold that were about to expire completely worthless because FDX's CEO changed and the stock took a hard dip.\n* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.  Same if you get caught up in a wave of hysteria.\n* Planning Trades:\n   * Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.  This is super important for strong movements and high volatility (see later). \n   * Hedge fund guy on YouTube stated that trading should be 90% planning and 10% execution.  I agree with this more and more.\n   * My rough trading outline:\n      * Make a list of potentially viable stocks.\n      * Perform research.\n      * Set up a watchlist of stocks you want to trade.\n      * Have entry and exit plans for your trades.  Setting stock price alerts for entries is my personal preference.\n      * Market opens / event occurs.  React according to your plan.\n      * Based on new information, adjust, open, or close positions accordingly.\n* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a \"new\" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade:[ https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/\n* \u201cRolling\u201d an option:  \n Closing your existing option and opening a similar one at a different strike and/or expiration.\n   * Rolling a call \u201cUp\u201d would be selling a call you own and buying a cheaper call at a higher strike.\n   * Rolling a put \u201cDown and out\u201d closes your original one and buying or selling one at a lower strike at a longer expiry.\n   * Better broker interfaces have a literal \u201cRoll\u201d button.  I know E-trade does.  You can manually do it by selecting relevant contract legs.\n* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption is definitely incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option over stubbornness.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (or buy another call / put).  Rolling out sold options can help here.\n* Don't try to day trade, especially with options.  It's statistically unlikely to be profitable.  Day-trading with options introduces extra liquidity risks and is dangerous, especially with spreads.\n* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me lose my hair; luckily it eventually came back.\n* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.\n* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid-day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.  I\u2019ve had success around 12-1PM EST after prices settle.\n* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.\n* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider \"doubling down\"; note this is higher risk.  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't ever recommend shorting shares.\n* Learn from your mistakes.  You can\u2019t go back in time and beating yourself up (to a point) is useless.  Make a physical &amp;/or mental note of it so you don\u2019t do it again.  If you don\u2019t learn from it, then beat yourself up so you won\u2019t do it again.\n* If you have friends that like to trade, I find it helpful to discuss strategies and planned plays.  I talk openly with my close friends about my current holdings and planned trades, it helps keep me accountable.  If I get a wide-eyed look, I might be doing something excessively risky or stupid.  I\u2019ve over-leveraged myself in calls twice and I knew I shouldn\u2019t have done it both times.  When I tell my friends what I did and I\u2019m embarrassed, it exemplifies the face that I shouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place.  You will also get ideas for new strategies or plays from them.  It\u2019s good to stay versatile and use multiple strategies when appropriate.  \n Beware of group-think/echo chambers. \n* I recommend NEVER telling someone what to buy/sell and when.  I\u2019ll tell people MY plays or what I like and why, but I will not encourage them to emulate what I do.  Depending on the audience, I\u2019ll tell them my exact positions along with my exit and entrance strategy.  With closer friends I\u2019ll offer my thoughts on their trades (if asked).  If my friend is doing something really risky (one of my friends does some scary stuff) I may ask them if they want my advice, and provide it, especially if they overlooked a risk/event.  I will not encourage someone to execute/enter a trade since it has a high potential for hurt feelings or animosity all around.\n* Don\u2019t fall in love with a stock.  \n Just because something made you money before and you have high confidence in it doesn\u2019t mean it will keep performing.  I joke that FDX betrayed me when it started dipping and losing me money.  I was over-confident of its bounce-back and sold too many puts too quickly.  I\u2019m in several losing trades because of it.  However, I will keep good stocks in my roster/tracking list or try different strategies or re-enter trades when they change their behavior.\n* As you start to both buy and sell options and get more experience in general, you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will likely click one day.  Most/all the Greeks and options concepts will become almost second nature.  For me this was when I could build an Iron Condor from scratch, which was a watershed moment involving a good understanding of many strategies.\n* Understand Liquidity and volume.\n   * Trading in low volume, low open interest contracts results in wide bid/ask spreads and difficulty having your contracts filled.  Look at all the data for a contract, not just the strike and price.\n   * Monthly Expiration dates typically have better liquidity.\n   * Multi-legged trades (Common examples are 2-legged vertical spreads or 4-legged iron condors) have more difficulty being filled, especially on bad brokers like Robin Hood.  Having very liquid options for all legs is extremely helpful in obtaining timely and well-priced fills, which maximize your potential profits.\n* Time in market vs timing the market:\n   * It is extremely difficult to time the market perfectly.  If you wait for the perfect opportunity forever, history has proven you will miss out on gains.  Keeping all your money out of the market has proven to be ineffective.  Now if there is something serious happening with a stock/the market (like say a new pandemic), don\u2019t go all in.  I recommend entering incrementally at dips.  If the stock has huge upside potential it may never go down, so it might make sense to partially enter at the current price.\n   * IMO selling puts is a great strategy to get into a stock you like, or at least make money off it.  I think buying stock in lots of 100 is usually for suckers.  Selling an ATM or ITM put (assuming the math works out) on a stock you were going to buy and hold is ALMOST free money.\n   * I recommend keeping some cash available regardless. If you have a very large account or expect a downturn, hedging with indexes like QQQ, SPY, or VIX or calls/puts may be wise.\n* Every trade can't be a winner.  You will take some losses, you must get used to it.  I don\u2019t like having a realized loss of 1K or more on any trade.  However, this will happen, especially with larger accounts.\n   * As long as you win more often and beat the S&amp;P that year I consider it okay.  I\u2019m kind of aggressive, so I consider 20%+ annually good.  30%+ annually is great.  40%+ and I\u2019m dancing.  After trading options I am almost baffled by my old belief that 5% annual returns (mostly from dividend ETFs) was \u201cgood\u201d.  That\u2019s nothing to me now since I\u2019m willing to take risks.  \nNote: While lots of people danced in 2020, realize that\u2019s an insane Bull Run year and is atypical. \n   * Adhere to your own risk tolerance and never over-extend yourself, especially with margin use.  Don\u2019t make huge gambles leaving you uncomfortable.  Only gamble with money you are willing to lose.\n   * My personal strategy is to make safer gains for the year and then enter slightly riskier strategies using those gains.  I can be slightly-moderately more aggressive and compound my gains.  For me I often sell puts to make money, then when I see a big opportunity I\u2019ll sell a put and buy an OTM or moderately ITM call.\n* Understand it\u2019s not safe to try and get rich overnight.  However, once you hit big \u201csteps\u201d things may start to snowball.  You can enter more positions and take more risks if you choose to.\n   * For me this when I hit 50k, then 100k.  I was able to balance low and moderate risk positions to more significantly grow my account.  I\u2019ll even do a high risk thing now and again because my gains can absorb it (assuming I have them).\n   * I can\u2019t wait to get to 250K, then 500K.  I know it\u2019ll take quite a long time, but I am confident I\u2019ll eventually be able to have 500K and (hopefully) 1M in my non-401k trading account with gains and additions from my job.  I can only imagine how \u201cdangerous\u201d I will be with that kind of capital.\n* If you missed \"the next big thing\" like AAPL, TSLA, or the time machine I\u2019m building in my basement.  Don't get upset, learn from it.  Adapt and become a better trader for next time.\n   * Figure out why a company was so promising, before they mooned.  Determine how you would have traded differently in hindsight.  Apply those lessons to the next company you believe has long term growth prospects.\n   * For me that's putting in 1-2.5k towards shares and/or buying LEAPS on it.  Depending on my bullishness I may buy \u201ccheap\u201d, fairly far OTM calls.  The far OTM options are sort of lottery tickets.  If I'm right the (relatively) low cost will have explosive profits; if I'm wrong, they didn't cost that much so it's a calculated loss I\u2019m willing to accept.  For more serious bets I\u2019ll buy ITM LEAPS to run PMCCs on.  I also like to buy 1-2K in my 401k for very long-term plays.\n* The stock market hates uncertainty, it seems to crave the status quo.  A shakeup can potentially tank a stock, even if it's nothing.  With shares you can wait it out, but this can be problematic for options.  If you see volatile/uncertain times ahead (politics, disease, manufacturing, earnings, etc.), you might want to reduce your overall portfolio risks or hedge.\n* Brokers:\n   * Find a good broker.  This article outlines good brokers that didn\u2019t restrict trading during the GameStop squeeze craziness.  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder\\_whether\\_you\\_own\\_gme\\_or\\_not\\_change\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder_whether_you_own_gme_or_not_change_your/)\n   * I have personally used the following and here are my ratings:  \nE-Trade &gt;&gt; Fidelity &gt;&gt; Ally &gt;&gt; Robin Hood.\n      * The &gt;&gt; denotes they are significantly better.  Fidelity is reliable, but their interface isn\u2019t good.  The app / site both work, but they are clumsy, \u201cweak\u201d, and outdated.  It\u2019s been described as \u201cboomer-friendly\u201d by a Fidelity employee on Reddit.  Fidelity does have a \u201cpro\u201d type desktop software, it is geared toward more professional traders.\n      * Ally Invest has bad tools, is generally trash, and is unreliable, don\u2019t use it.\n      * RH is free, but has bad fills.  It is super unreliable and has had huge stock buying restrictions in stocks and quantities for multiple days.  I don\u2019t trade in their app anymore, but I do like using their wish lists for quick chart glances at daily activity.\n   * I really like E-Trade (and you\u2019re about to hear why).\n      * E-trade has Power E-Trade on both desktop and mobile.  These are fantastic tools for options trading.\n      * The mobile app destroys (most/all) other mobile apps in terms of organization, data available, and effectiveness.  I think it\u2019s phenomenal.  I can throw together a 4-legged trade in seconds.  I can easily see all Greeks, intrinsic/extrinsic value, volume, and every other trade parameter I need through their option chain screen by swiping left / right.\n      * *Note, I have not tried Schwab, just watched YouTube videos of their app.  From watching those, Power E trade looks better.*\n      * The desktop version also has a trade analyzer (extensive P/L calculator) and a strategy seeker.  The strategy tool gives you suggested trades based on your expected movement direction, expiry date, and amount invested.  Both are well done and powerful.\n      * These tools are so intuitive and powerful that I would have a hard time going to another broker, even if it\u2019s slightly cheaper.  Even if E-Trade drops the ball again, I might keep my main account with them and set up my secondary / backup account with Schwab; that\u2019s how much I like Power E-trade.\n      * **Noteworthy downsides.**  They restricted GME buying for \\~2 hours during market hours (\\~2-4PM) and all after hours on Thursday 1/28/21 when the GME craziness was happening.  This was the only restriction on buying I\u2019m aware of.  \nThe following week there was a day where I couldn\u2019t execute a trade for an hour at open.  This was during very high volume, but still no excuse.  These issues made me very angry with them.  These were the first big problems I\u2019ve had in several months of active trading through them.\n      * My biggest annoyance.  Power e trade sometimes shows spreads incorrectly arranged on mobile.  On desktop you can adjust / fix the spread groups with the \u201cCustom Groups\u201d button, but mobile sometimes mixes two spreads or condors with the same symbol and expiry.  This shows you different things than what you set up, but doesn't actually change what you own.  For example I could open a 170/175 put credit spread and sell a 180 put.  It might get confused on mobile and say 170/180 spread and 175 put.\n      * They are usually very reliable, but they are not perfect.  I\u2019m staying with them unless they have more major issues.\n      * Their options fees go from $.65 to .50 a contract once you trade enough, 30 trades / quarter I think.  They\u2019ll give you further discounts if you trade a lot for months, then call to ask for an option fee reduction/negotiation.\n      * If you decide to open an E-trade account and put enough money in, there is a new account incentive.  It scales up depending on your contribution.  If you feel like it, you can use my referral link.  PM me for it if you\u2019re interested.\n   * Rock Solid Brokers:\n      * Fidelity: Mediocre-bad tools, very reliable.\n      * Vanguard: Expensive.  Reliable.\n      * Schwab: OK prices.  Second hand, tools look okay-good.  Very good reputation and reliable.  If I ever decide to switch / diversify from E-trade, I\u2019m trying them.\n* Don\u2019t over leverage yourself, understand your own risk tolerance.  Don\u2019t use up all your cash or margin buying power.  Leave funds available to react if the market turns against you.  If you use margin maintenance, ensure you have a cushion to prevent a potentially costly margin call.\n\n# Profit Retention / Loss Mitigation\n\n* If selling options, it is a viable strategy to close early after a large gain with many DTE left until expiry.  See TT videos / strategies on this.\n* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I like playing on earnings run ups, but that can be risky.\n* If you hold options through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards, devaluing the option.  However, if the option is profitable enough, IV crush won\u2019t matter, which will still make money for a call buyer.  A sold put sufficiently far OTM will benefit from IV crush, even if the stock dips after slightly bad or lukewarm earnings.\n* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.  If you are wrong and still believe in the company, wait twice as long as your original plan (wait for your 2nd entry point vs 1st) before adding to your position.\n* Consider using stop losses to lock-in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  \n In December 2020 I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls I was already up on and I \"lost\" \\~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big, don't get too greedy.\n* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  \nClose some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes into outer space/the floor.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below its current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up in little bits incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.\n* Have rules when to roll out, down &amp; out, or up &amp; out.  I like TT\u2019s roll at break even or at 1x loss and to always roll for a credit (or for me a very minor cost).  Obviously these rules need some monitoring.  Know your stocks, the news, and technicals so you don\u2019t jump the gun.  \n   * If you roll early for a credit and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not the end of the world.  You\u2019ll just need to hold longer, which will obviously tie up capital.  Sometimes it\u2019s better to tie up some money (especially if you aren\u2019t paying interest) than eating a huge loss.\n   * Rolling too late can be worse though.  I currently have a very underwater FDX put I sold that is over 2x loss, rolling it does almost nothing unless you want to pay a debit or extend it extremely far out.\n* On huge options gains, **I strongly recommend taking profits by rolling up/down** or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).\n   * Rolling up involves selling your initial call, then using a fraction of your proceeds to buy a cheaper, further OTM call with the same expiry; puts are inverse this.  When rolling up I like to ensure the new option\u2019s cost is 15-40% of my realized gains.  I\u2019ll buy a more or less expensive replacement option based on my conviction in the stock and predicted movements.  You can also roll up and out to get a further expiry and strike.\n   * This is monumentally important if you are playing with incredibly high rising stocks or during a short squeeze.\n   * **Sad story time:**  \nI completely screwed up when I forgot to roll up, twice, during the GME gamma/short squeeze.  I didn\u2019t take my own advice; I didn\u2019t have a real exit or transition plan and I got emotional.  It all happened so fast and I was at work; the insanity of the run up and subsequent gamma squeeze caught me off guard.  I should\u2019ve clocked out and thought through the situation for 15-30 minutes to form an impromptu plan, then executed trade(s).  My moderate risk tolerance coupled with my desire to take profits took over.  When the stock partially cratered after a run up, I sold to retain gains.  In the heat of the moment I thought the squeeze was squoze and it was going to plummet into the ground and I wasn\u2019t being rational.\n      * On 1x 4K call I would\u2019ve made an additional 15-25K if I rolled up to a cheaper contract with some of my profits.\n      * I know I missed out on significantly more with a 2nd call I had.  Depending when I rolled it, it would likely have been an additional 25-50k in profits.\n   * I talked about learning from your mistakes above.  **This mistake is branded into my brain due to the massive gains I missed out on** **by not rolling up****.**  I\u2019m furious with myself as I write this 1 week after the GME gamma squeeze, I\u2019m a planner and I didn\u2019t plan.  If anything I own is significantly up ever again, I\u2019m rolling up (or at least setting a stop loss).  If necessary, I\u2019ll roll up a trade multiple times to keep extracting profits.\n   * Learn from my mistake so you don\u2019t miss out on gains too.  I strongly recommend rolling up when you are up big on a call / roll down when you are up big on a put.  This enables you to take profits, stay in the game, and keep extracting more gains.\n* If you trade a lot of options, talk to your broker about a discount.  I was getting the standard $.50/contract with E-Trade, but I traded over 300 contracts a quarter and was able to get the fee reduced by over $.10 by just asking.  I am now doing more spreads and condors, so once my volume gets very high, I\u2019ll ask again.\n* If you have a broker that isn\u2019t great and you want to switch, leverage your current trading fees to the new broker.  Tell them you\u2019ll move over $### thousand if they beat your current options trading fee per contract.\n\n# Trade Planning &amp; Position Management Tips\n\n* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc. you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.\n* Having rough rules to close trades early can be a smart strategy.\n   * A common rule is if you hit 50% max profit in 1/3 of the contract length, close it early.\n   * A slightly more aggressive rule, that I roughly adhere to, is if you hit 66% max profit in \\~1/3 the contract length, close it early.\n   * If you sell \u201cnaked\u201d / on margin it may make sense to keep huge winners open, especially with sold/written puts.  I sometimes keep these big winners open with only 10-20% of the value left.  I let theta slowly bleed them dry to get extra money.  I\u2019m using my (free) naked put margin maintenance to get extra profits.  If other trades start to go bad, I\u2019ll close these big winners to free up capital.\n* Before entering a trade, look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your relevant strikes as well as entry/exit points.  Look at upcoming earnings &amp; dividend dates as well as stock/market news.\n* Consider staggering strikes and expirations for safety and diversity; it\u2019s nice to avoid assignment on 3 puts at once because you used the same strike for all 3.\n* Incrementally enter positions on large rises/falls.  One of my favorite strategies is to buy dips after over reactions.  By doing this slowly in large price \"steps\" it helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.\n   * This will also help you avoid \"chasing a falling knife\".  It also ties into having a plan.\n   * I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.\n* Don't buy far expiration options with poor liquidity for shorter term plays.  I bought 1x GME 1-year+ LEAPS call before the 2021 short squeeze.  That was stupid, I should've bought 2-3x 60-120 day calls to have better liquidity.  I also paper-handed it and missed out on my lambo.\n* If selling options, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be a valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side, if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.  See rolling \u201crules\u201d above.\n* Covered Calls:\n   * If a stock has a large movement range, I think it can be worthwhile to wait to open a CC after the last one is closed/expires.  I have been more successful waiting for another opportunity vs. opening one immediately on the Monday after the second the last one expires.\n   * Consider selling covered calls at all time highs/peaks.  If you sell a CC and the stock dips significantly, and you think it\u2019s temporary, you can buy to close your CC for a quick profit, then reopen it later.\n   * If you own Meme stocks, selling covered calls runs the risk of missing out on large gains.  On these stocks I typically only sell them further OTM than I normally would or not at all.  If I do sell CC on a Meme stock I try to ensure I have 25-100 other shares that won\u2019t be called away.\n* Dead cat bounce.\n   * After a huge price drop sometimes a stock will pop or partially recover temporarily.\n   * It could be a reversal or a false flag.  Be aware of this so you can react accordingly.\n   * [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/101700.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/101700.asp)\n* Finding stocks:\n   * u/swaggymedia publishes great lists of stocks at various price points with high and low IVs.  See r/SwaggyStocks, the new subreddit.\n   * Here are a few examples:\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv\\_report\\_high\\_iv\\_tickers\\_with\\_share\\_price\\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv_report_high_iv_tickers_with_share_price_under/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend\\_iv\\_report\\_tickers\\_with\\_low\\_iv\\_and\\_cheaper/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend_iv_report_tickers_with_low_iv_and_cheaper/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend\\_iv\\_report\\_stocks\\_with\\_high\\_iv\\_and\\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend_iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv\\_report\\_stocks\\_with\\_high\\_iv\\_and\\_more\\_expensive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more_expensive/)\n   * I recommend building a large roster of stocks you want to trade with and check it at least daily.  My \u201cwheel candidate\u201d list is 26 \u201csolid\u201d stocks plus 20-25 I\u2019m lukewarm about.  I want it to be at 100-200.\n   * With a large stock candidate list it makes it easy to find targets to buy dips on and exploit opportunities.  I like selling puts at dips with some downside protection.\n* Below is another reddit user's more aggressive theta gang variant.  I think this has merits, I'm trying it myself with a few stocks.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k\\_to\\_475k\\_in\\_4\\_months\\_using\\_theta\\_wsb\\_techniques/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k_to_475k_in_4_months_using_theta_wsb_techniques/)\n\n* Buying calls or puts with more DTE than you need is a very smart strategy IMO.\n   * Buying extra time becomes progressively cheaper after \\~1 month and keeps theta from hurting you as much.  See LEAPS later.\n   * I started off buying 30-45 DTE calls, then moved to 45-60 DTE.\n   * Now I am tinkering with only buying calls/puts that have 90-120+ DTE (monthlies).  I plan to close these with at least 30-45 DTE left since theta starts to really depreciate your contracts at 45 days, especially at 30 days.  If I\u2019m playing an event or a specific date, I ensure I have at least 30 days past that with whatever I purchase.\n   * Buying longer dated contracts, while more capital \u201cefficient\u201d, is more costly.  I couldn\u2019t do this when I had a small account.  There is also more downside risk; since the contract is more valuable, you can lose more.  I try to only have 1-3 calls open at a time in one stock so if I\u2019m wrong I don\u2019t get destroyed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI\u2019m not a financial advisor, I\u2019m not an engineer.  I\u2019m not telling you to invest in a specific stock/option or even use a specific strategy.  I\u2019ve outlined and more extensively elaborated on what I personally like.

        "selftext": "TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1ubpfxize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d58b12644e9688e15e35e907386b910b9d938d\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**\n\n Add'l edit for those who can't read good - \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 ",

Figured I\u2019d come here and see if I can solicit some better ideas. I\u2019m new to r/stocks so if I\u2019ve screwed up on some of your rules please let me know.\n\nI generally invest in high growth data stocks as I work in the industry and I\u2019m beginning to think blackberry will be nicely positioned in a couple of years to dominate and worst case the rising tide will raise all the boats.\n\nSmarter people can break down the financials so I want to focus on positioning, markets, branding, board members and the AWS partnership. I\u2019m doing my best to clean up my last post because I realize this is a higher level of discourse.\n\n\n1. Repeat CEO: you\u2019re not paying for someone to learn on the job, John Chen has done it before and can handle the stress. I\u2019m thinking this is his swan song. \n\nHe has a 90 million dollar bonus at a $30 USD price point for 10 days by 2023. don\u2019t think CEOs generally miss out on 90 million dollar bonuses but hey what do I know.\n\n\n2. Potential market size: IOT security and data collection. I personally care the most about their auto investment in QNX and IVY but the board of directors reflect a whole slew of other bets that are also potentially majorly profitable. \n\nThe military side of the equation may become more material with the New board member: Lisa Disbrow. \nOnce again I\u2019ll defer to smarter people to do market evaluation and sizing. \n\n\n3. Sales orientation/cycle: this is a company that usually deals with governments, financial institutions, and enterprise clients. They are used to the longer and more complex sales cycles associated with this so there will be no learning curve when approaching larger clients.\n\n\n4. [Board of directors:](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/board-of-directors) I like to follow money and influence.\n\n\nInteresting highlights:\n\nJohn Chen\u2019s: CEO that delivered an exit of Sybase. Really strong history of maintaining relationships in China and on trade boards with China. See BOD link above.\n\nPrem Watsa: Canada\u2019s Warren Buffett. Reddit deity of justifying this investment. Fairfax financial and a value investor. He brought in John Chen\n\nMike Daniels: John Chen\u2019s Sybase buddy and cybersecurity executive. Well positioned to influence across the cyber security industry\n\nTimothy Dattels: TPG Capital major investor in Asia.\n\nLisa Disbrow: New Board member. She is the military connection and was Senate-confirmed Under Secretary of the United States Air Force, and she served as Acting Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from January 2017 to May 2017.\n\nRichard Lynch : Ex-cto of Verizon wireless.\n\nDr. Smaldone Alsup: Pharma positioning, take a look at [PharmApprove](https://pharmapprove.com) and you\u2019ll get a better sense of her speciality working on positioning.\n\nBarbara Stymiest: Big player in Canada. Current portfolio includes: director of George Weston Limited, Sun Life Financial Inc. and the University Health Network, and is Chair of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. For you Americans out there George Weston is the really big name there.\n\nWayne Wouters: Strategy and policy advisor on the government front. at one point he was Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nJust wanted to give a high level breakdown of the board and if you can give a more complete picture on benefits and risks of these players I\u2019d love to hear it.\n\n\n5. BLACKBERRY IVY:  Generally I don\u2019t look that deeply into products but I\u2019ll do you all a favour and break down the branding and real market value to both companies.\n\nIt\u2019s an Amazon partnership but it\u2019s called Blackberry Ivy. Does that strike you as being a bit interesting? They avoided the Amazon brand name on purpose. BB owns the commercial relationship limiting Amazon\u2019s exposure to the customer and fear of being screwed by the 2nd largest company in the world.\n\nAuto execs are all aware of competition risks coming from Apple and Google. Also on the Google front they have learned from advertising that Google like to own the data. Tesla is a direct competitor so I don\u2019t see much risk losing OEM business to then.\n\nIt\u2019s been branded blackberry and avoided touching anything associated with data ownership to make the product more attractive to the OEMs.\n\nThey are looking for a monopoly on the censors and data transfer and have what seems like a 2 year head start. \nThis is a rounding error for Amazon but material for bb. Amazon payoff will be the number of clients that transfer to AWS because of ease of integration and reduced costs of moving the data.\n\n6. Blackberry and Apple: every single employee of blackberry knows what happened with Apple and knows what happens when you sit comfortably on a lead as opposed to paying offence. If you are worried about a company culture that is stagnant and moving too slowly go find someone who is currently winning not a comeback kid.\n\n7. Negatives: \nShit brand with reputation as an loser. \n\nARR: the only thing that really matters. Of course Ivy is a subscription that wasn\u2019t a surprise. They need to show positive growth and then you can be considered a 10-20x revenue cap. Do that for 4 quarters and then you can be a cool kid and get to 50x.\n\n\nTL;DR. I want actual feedback so if you don\u2019t just post rockets or some other bullshit that would be great",

They indicated that this co-developed platform would be used in future vehicles. The E-GMP platform they eventually released seems way less advanced than Canoo's platform in the photos (e.g. it has struts vs Canoo's with leaf spring suspension), so the E-GMP platform could be the intermediate step until the co-developed platform is ready.\n\nApple tried to buy Canoo for it\u2019s skateboard platform in 2020 and was turned down by Canoo. This makes a lot of sense for Apple because Canoo platform is really advanced (steer-by-wire, leaf spring suspension, crash test incorporated into skateboard, batteries incorporated into structure, very modular and fast development times/costs) and lets Apple focus on what they excel at, which is tech and quick development cycles.\n\nApple eventually forms a manufacturing partnership with Hyundai and it's rumored they're using Hyundai skateboard in the \"initial\" version, which is important because it signals they still want to use 3P skateboard. It seems that while they are likely using the E-GMP platform for the first iteration, the 2024 timeline easily puts them in line to use the new Canoo/Hyundai platform when it is done, which is consistent with the fact that Apple has already tried to purchase Canoo specifically for it's skateboard platform.\n\n**tl;dr -** seems very possible that the Apple car will use the Canoo skateboard as the foundation",

        "selftext": "**Hello everyone! This isn\u2019t my usual kind of post, but man, I can\u2019t stand to see how people just follow every freaking YouTuber out there blindly!** In this post, we are going to talk about why I believe Tom Nash may be a **fraud**, so please do have some patience and read the full post, as I will go through an in-depth research of his past and his claims.\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nLet\u2019s start by talking about who Tom Nash is &amp; says he is. He is a new &amp; trendy \u201cfinance &amp; stock market\u201d YouTuber which has recently passed 150K subscribers after exploding during this retail investor boom, but here is a short [video](https://imgur.com/yuNMUlv) from his YouTube describing himself.\n\nIn the video he is claiming he is a former \u201csenior financial analyst\u201d which is very hard to believe in my opinion after doing a lot of research about him.\n\nSo let\u2019s go through the **5 reasons** I believe he is lying about his past &amp; why you should never take anything any YouTuber out there says for granted and you should do your own research as well:\n\n**1)  Let\u2019s start with the biggest one, his valuation methods are flawed**\n\nEven though he has posted some videos that have panned out, it\u2019s very hard to differentiate good analysis from pure luck in this recent bull market, even monkeys could throw darts at stocks in the past 11 months and be right after the March sell-off.\n\nI was pretty curious of his valuation methods so I joined his channel membership and asked him a direct question, about his DCF valuation, to which he [responded](https://imgur.com/Zdtm2dI) bluntly that I am doing things wrong. I also sent him a direct link to a well-known financial institute, where we can see that the most common cash flow used for financial [modeling](https://imgur.com/MSJgiSk), which is the unlevered free cash flow, implies that you subtract any capital expenditures of the company, which contradicts the way he sees it and is plain wrong, it\u2019s like he uses 2nd grade math, if you subtract a negative number then your cash flow actually increases, which doesn\u2019t even make sense. How can something that costs you money be a positive on the free cash flow?\n\nI\u2019ll let you digest this as I will next show you some of his DCF valuations &amp; how he uses absurd numbers and changes the formulas as he pleases just to reach some insane valuations for companies just to be catchy.\n\nHere are a couple of short extracts from his Salesforce DCF calculations,\n\n[**Exibit A**](https://streamable.com/vu2agx) \\- everything seems legit until here, now he starts with the biggest mistake in this DCF\n\n[**Exibit B**](https://imgur.com/BWeAZw8) \\- I\u2019ll be blunt you can never, ever add the Capex number to a DCF valuation, that literally throws the hole calculations off, but let\u2019s continue\u2026\n\n[**Exibit C**](https://imgur.com/LgHKupD) \\- So, using a discount rate of 6% is also insane, even with the current low interest rates, you should at least discount the average [SP500](https://imgur.com/YTxt90T) return, or use the WACC or any other type of metric, which is much safer than picking out a single company, as the SP500 has proven over long-stretches to be a great performer.\n\nBut yeah guys, this isn\u2019t the first time he has done these kind of errors, you can see he is using most of these methods in many stock picks which are then spread out to thousands of new investors, who don\u2019t really have the knowledge to test what he is saying. I\u2019m just showing you here a couple of stocks like [Dynatrace](https://imgur.com/hAO37u8), [Opendoor](https://imgur.com/66rMYZe), [Alibaba](https://imgur.com/ikLetLL), [Peloton](https://imgur.com/WRoLdIL), [Salesforce](https://imgur.com/D9Ky3gl) as I showed in the previous video and even [Apple](https://imgur.com/g8k7ZxA) that have been analyzed and spread to the public this way.\n\nThe other big issue with his valuations is that he is using insane long-term growth rates, as he used a 5% growth rate for [Peloton](https://imgur.com/EV2WB9Y) to reach a higher valuation, so can you imagine? If Peloton grows at a 5% rate in perpetuity it means they should more than double the inflation [rate](https://imgur.com/xaN3Dxw) every year and is way higher than any GDP [growth](https://imgur.com/Jkk01c9) the US has seen since 1984.\n\nHe is also [implying](https://imgur.com/Wkd2AV8) that Peloton has no debt on it\u2019s balance sheet, which is 100% false, as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/rsB0fJg), he used the cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities to calculate the short term assets while completely ignoring the over $700M in accounts payable no to mention the other current liabilities which would add up to almost exactly the $1.4B in assets he added to his calculations.\n\nBut who knows guys? Maybe he is the real deal, as he has made some [correct](https://imgur.com/v3ZYhSU) DCF implications for some stocks like [Fortinet](https://imgur.com/kCTo7jC) and [FuboTV](https://imgur.com/vojljFt), by actually subtracting the Capex finally, though he doesn\u2019t do this in every analysis, not even in the most recent ones while also keeping that big long-term growth rate at 5%, when I myself never use a bigger one than 4%.\n\nJust for an [example](https://imgur.com/tnWSWVa) I took his CRM numbers and popped them up in my spreadsheets, and even given his methods I couldn\u2019t quite get to the same results without manually editing numbers, as those implications resulted in a 7% undervaluation for the stock, while only adjusting the Capex to be a negative on the cashflows and not touching anything else that might be wrong in this DCF, [resulted](https://imgur.com/5vxgKqI) in a 10% overvaluation for the stock.\n\nSo, I think if he really was a 10+ years wall street analyst I don\u2019t think he could have made these obvious mistakes.\n\n**2) So, Is Tom Nash whom he says he is or is he lying about his past?**\n\n[HERE](https://imgur.com/wbJ8Csh) is the channel intro for his YouTube (Which I can't even see anymore, but i was lucky to download it a couple of days ago)\n\nAs you Can see, I don\u2019t doubt that he actually went to Michigan or that he got and MBA, but I do doubt that all of his Successful \u201cSenior\u201d Financial analyst &amp; consulting Career can be described with only a couple of weak-ass photos of him at an NBA game, or him casually at some kind of a course program as that is exactly what it looks like with the other guys in the back-left of the photo.\n\nAlso, are we to believe all of this great financial career ended with him just taking out his fake plant from his office, while also smiling as he threw away at least a decent salary for a gamble on YouTube, which is very hard to do, especially when you are starting, as YouTube doesn\u2019t really help the small guys.\n\nHis YouTube journey seemed to have [started](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) on the path of exposing guru\u2019s and not financial advice, as he also says in the video, so how did he turn to do financial analysis on YouTube? Seems pretty convenient that he just became an expert in stock analysis as YouTube videos on such things were booming.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/Vq4ov7x), he didn\u2019t make a single stock analysis for the most part of 2020, which seems pretty off, as now most of his videos are on stock analysis, and while his channel was created in 2017, he conveniently deleted all the previous videos, which is another weird move to do.\n\nI also went on a deep internet dive and did a lot of searching about him and I found this video [podcast](https://imgur.com/09mBKRU) of him.\n\nHis main intro in this podcast is that he works as a consultant indeed, from Israel, and also the consultancy job isn\u2019t for a financial company, it\u2019s rather to help people on YouTube grow, so let's look at some extracts from the video:\n\n[**Exibit I**](https://streamable.com/xrbv3o) \\- We can see the main part of the talk is nothing about anything related to his financial past, let\u2019s continue\n\n[**Exibit II**](https://imgur.com/Ziftnpi) \\- It seems he started with a gaming channel, not even a fake guru channel, and I also found something about that FB [GROUP](https://imgur.com/Xdt4H1i) which isn\u2019t active anymore and all of the videos he made for that have also been deleted as you can see in this [post](https://imgur.com/FyKSrIq) from way back in 2018 as he was [teaching](https://imgur.com/T5lbbH2) how to make money on YouTube well through 2019, and was even giving out free workshop [experiences](https://imgur.com/K89Yk3S)  as he was pumping out creator [content](https://imgur.com/z196rMB) which is miles apart from financial analysis (BTW, he is using the same freaking photo in his old banner &amp; logo as his current one, just changing the green screen background), just look at [his](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) old YouTube banner (YouTube tips &amp; tutorials)\n\n[**Exibit III**](https://imgur.com/kZddAl3) \\- Yeah, it seems he also did some video on how to promote on Reddit, and what comes next guys is literally mind blowing, how much more can this dude lie &amp; hide?\n\n[**Exibit IV**](https://streamable.com/ji6ne2) \\-  Well\u2026 Nothing to hide then\u2026 He even had a Fiverr account which was called tomernash you can see clearly [HERE](https://imgur.com/topDW52), that is his username, and when I went out to check it out right now, he is [using](https://imgur.com/HVqNkwv) a fake picture &amp; and still might live in Israel, not the US, and on top of this he might not actually even be from Russia, which he has been saying over &amp; over again on his channel. You can [SEE](https://imgur.com/18Yiimf) he reiterates he is a certified YouTube consultant with no mention of his financial skills or certifications.\n\nAnd even more, you see what picture he uses as a logo yeah? Well, I did a reverse google search and found the other guy also has a YouTube [channel](https://imgur.com/DWpofDb) about kinetic cycling.\n\nMaybe he was one of his clients that he reached a deal to use his picture, wtf, the more I dig in the more I am amazed of the lengths this man has gone to reach fame on YouTube.\n\n[**Exibit V**](https://streamable.com/sdtd7d) \\- So\u2026 A financial analyst with no sheets, no paper, no nothing, great stuff for a senior financial analyst, I literally can\u2019t take more of this so let\u2019s move to the next reasons\n\n**3) Getting in front of the lie?**\n\nI believe that\u2019s what he was trying to do to, by making a [VIDEO](https://imgur.com/CeH7ePh) on this very subject in mid-2020 and popping up higher in the search rankings before his channel boomed.\n\nIn the video he clarifies that Tom Nash isn\u2019t his real name, but he also restated that he was working for a big consultancy firm as recent as this summer, and that he does shit tons of stuff which is very hard to believe, as usually this big consultancy firms have different departments for different things that he mentioned in the video. You can still find that video on his channel if you are interested\n\nBut, by the way, how was he working on that job while also doing hundreds of Fiverr jobs as a YouTube consultant?\n\nHe also claims to not offering any courses, e-books or other stuff like this, which is false as i showed in the previous reasons with his past YouTube courses &amp; other stuff, and as you will see in the next reasons, something smells really bad out here.\n\n**4) Claims about his past**\n\nI also took a deeper dive into more of his past, as you can see in [his](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) previous channel cover and info, he had only about 4K subscribers as he was doing guru video reviews on YouTube, but all of a sudden, he [became](https://imgur.com/r6X2yHg) a senior financial analyst from wall street that was living in Israel &amp; doing Fiverr gigs, I don\u2019t know what to say but it seems pretty fishy to me.\n\nI also checked his LinkedIn [page](https://imgur.com/Xpbq7Im), and all of his skills &amp; endorsements seem to be related to his YouTube skills and nothing about finance or the stock market.\n\nBut I also found his [profile](https://imgur.com/9FxHnCb) on Quora, where he wasn\u2019t that active but still, well back in [2017](https://imgur.com/EUPer8h) he was posting things about gaming &amp; YouTube while supposedly still working on Wall Street as a financial analyst, and it\u2019s interesting that there is no [mention](https://imgur.com/kcpxh2X) of him following anything related to stocks, finance, economy, accounting, statistics or anything other related to the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I guess when you make a new type of video and it boosts your channel from just [10K](https://imgur.com/GEvQ7yB) subscribers all the way up to [150K](https://imgur.com/3F0D4rI) subscribers, you are willing to push the limits and lie about your past just to keep everything going, as YouTube is a really good way to make money right now.\n\n**5) The Transformation**\n\nHe has had even more channels in the past not only this one, which he has transformed overnight from a YouTube Channel [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) to a Guru [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) and finally to a financial [analyst](https://imgur.com/oCIBljZ) , as He created a second &amp; third YouTube account called [GearlyReviews](https://imgur.com/9vAPlu3) where he reviews electronics and [EuroBall](https://imgur.com/G130Wgr) where he only posted 2 videos.\n\nI also searched him through his Reddit [posts](https://imgur.com/zmsRhbB) and only could find things related to marketing &amp; social media, nothing about finance yet again.\n\n# So, my personal opinion which I doubt to be wrong guys, if there is a case of a dubious &amp; fishy person out there, he is one of them.\n\nI believe that he has never worked as a senior financial analyst and especially not a stock market, asset or any other type of equity analyst.\n\nMost of his stock [picks](https://imgur.com/uOgFNkQ) are small-caps that are highly volatile or a couple of recent high flyers which are very catchy to any YouTube audience.\n\nThere are many things wrong about the picture he has painted about himself even though he has gone through a lot to try and erase his past. The fact that there are no mentions of things from the wall street or consulting firm, bad stock analysis and methods, fishy and dubious moves of his YouTube channels and especially fishy things about him being a consultant &amp; analyst in early 2020 while he was already doing YouTube and other stuff back in 2017-2018 really makes me not want to buy his story.\n\nFolks, be careful out there, you can find a lot of YouTubers out there who make more money from their advice giving on YouTube, Patreon or other kind of subscriptions and courses, compared to the actual money they are making or have ever made in the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I don\u2019t want to make a final judgment on this guy, but you should consider everything I have showed about him and all the problems with his past &amp; his financial methods &amp; just remember as always **in a bull market everyone is an expert &amp; genius**, while in a bear market you can\u2019t find any of these people as they all flee.\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

What happened on Friday was a rotation of capital from pandemic stocks to small cap and mid cap stocks. \n\nOn Friday, as the Finviz heat map shows, we saw a sell-off in traditional growth stocks (i.e. mega cap tech, health care and consumer defensive stocks).\n\nThe other thing the Finviz heat map shows is another move of capital into small caps and mid caps as investors take profits from large and mega caps that were pumped up by the pandemic and build more distributed portfolios. I.e. people are building new portfolios for 2021's that move away from pandemic stocks.\n\nThis is important information to pay attention to. Which is why, in my opinion, you don't ignore Red days, or complain about people you think are naive or inexperienced investors when they sit up and start asking questions or selling stocks they think have topped out to buy new stocks that they think are better going forward. \n\nIf you're not ready to take information that the Red days offer us, and update/rebalance your portfolio going forward based on that information, you're going to miss out on signals that the environment may be changing. And then you might get stuck in diminishing returns as the market moves in a different direction than the portfolio you're sitting in serves best. \n\nIMO, the action last week suggests people who are going to sit in a 2020-inspired pandemic portfolio for all of 2021 will probably see diminishing returns. \n\nThe rotations into small and mid caps, and also from mega cap growth to value, have been taking place from time to time since the November election, and it seems to be an accelerating trend. Last week also saw a big drop in gold prices at the same time as a stiff uptick in consumer interest rates, which indicates a move away from pandemic safe havens, into higher interest and higher yield investments. The selling of gold into a consumer interest rate hike also suggests the move to value investing in the latter half of last week isn't just noise, because gold is also a hedge against inflation and has tended to go up during times of climbing interest rates. \n\nSo everyone who is bashing Red day alarmists in threads where you talk about how you got big gains in 2020 for doing nothing but investing in Apple type stocks, buying in at the March bottom or riding SPY for 100% gains, if you're not updating your portfolio for 2021 right now, you're probably underperforming the market as these sector and market cap rotations occur. \n\nFor me, last week was the week where I disengaged from a lot of EV sector investments, leaving only a few percent of my portfolio in them. And I was ready to catch the small and mid cap industrial bounce on Friday, which was a big green day for me even tho the indices were flat. \n\nPersonally, I expect these trends to small cap, mid cap and value stocks to continue throughout the Spring and I expect the money for those gains will continue to come from the mega cap tech stocks and pandemic portfolio positions that people/institutional investors are are taking profits from. \n\nThe Red days raise alarms that something is happening and that something is sometimes a change in direction. So I see the rotation out of mega cap and large cap pandemic plays and into small cap, mid cap and value + growth stocks is a trend that is firming up. \n\nThat trend is probably going to become very significant by the end of the quarter, in March, when institutional and professional investors have to rebalance their portfolios across asset classes, take profits and cut bloated positions. The shift in interest rates and asset class rotations is a significant change in investing environment. If you're still sitting in passive index ETFs or pandemic stocks, you may want to start preparing for a rebalance, too. There will probably be more Red days like this one, particularly toward the end of March. So for many who are still sitting in pandemic portfolios, you might have a Red March if you don't start revisiting your holdings in February.",

        "selftext": "By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n\n\nHere\u2019s some DD for anybody who doesn\u2019t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n\n\neBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That\u2019s just a given. \n\n\nI am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. \n\n\nLots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I\u2019m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn\u2019t why I\u2019m going fucking hard in the calls. Here\u2019s the real cherry on top:\n\neBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it\u2019s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n\n\nWell guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn\u2019t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. \n\nThis is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it\u2019s time we do the same.\n\n\nOh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok\u00e9mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It\u2019s 2021.\n\n\neBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I\u2019ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. \n\n\nTLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL",

        "selftext": "**Should you buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**\n\n**\\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! So, let\u2019s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.\n\n**\\[Disclosure: I made this DD last month, but I wasn't part of this Subreddit until the last few days\\]**\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company\u2019s total net sales in the last fiscal year.\n\nAlso, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.\n\nAlongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook\u2019s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.\n\nWe also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that\u2019s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.\n\nThe 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.\n\nThey also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.\n\nBut the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.\n\nThe latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.\n\nI think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.\n\nWe also shouldn\u2019t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.\n\nAnd one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.\n\nI think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple\u2019s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.\n\nBut this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.\n\nAnd last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.\n\nI also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don\u2019t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.\n\nSo, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don\u2019t be afraid to leave a comment down below.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.\n\nThis are my 2025 projections for Apple, let\u2019s take a closer look at them, each on their own.\n\nSo, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.\n\nThe next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.\n\nThe iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.\n\nThe 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.\n\nI gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.\n\nAnd last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don\u2019t forget any others.\n\nSo, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.\n\nI think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.\n\nIn terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \\[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \\] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.\n\nIn the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company\u2019s supplier\u2019s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.\n\nSo, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.\n\nI also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.\n\nI think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don\u2019t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.\n\nThis money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.\n\nMoving on, let\u2019s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.\n\nThis would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.\n\nSo, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don\u2019t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today\u2019s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.\n\nI don\u2019t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.\n\nSo [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.\n\nI think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.\n\nSo here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \\[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \\] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nKeep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?\n\nThe company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn\u2019t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it\u2019s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Hi all, I came up with a good way to extract institutional investor transactions using Python from an API in order to analyse if investors are buying or selling stocks in a particular company. \n\nFor example, below table is the outcome showing the transactions performed by institutional investors since the 11th of February on 4 different companies.\n\n\n    total   buys  sells      total_shares_exchanged\n    AAPL  159.0  127.0   32.0           122816727.0\n    MSFT  293.0  251.0   42.0             292622179.0\n    ETSY   42.0   37.0    5.0               3978781.0\n    ATVI  115.0  104.0   11.0               1161650.0\n\n\nWhile the data is useful, I am struggling to make a good use of it. For instance, if I look into MSFT, I can see that 127 institutional funds bough stocks in MSFT and 27 sold stocks. \n\nWhat I would like to do with this analysis is to find stocks that institutional investors are currently buying a lot. \n\nDoes someone know what would be the best approach to do this? I thought about running the script for a bunch of companies and compare them together. But that approach does not make sense because obviously, large market-cap companies will attract more transactions than small-cap companies and they may not be really comparable.\n\nIn case any of you is interested on how to get institutional investor transactions using Python, I have a video showing step by step:\n[Analysing Institutional Investor Transactions!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy_KtPGGTEk)",
