The US is considering imposing export restrictions on China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/05/us-considers-blacklisting-chinas-largest-chipmaker-as-tech-tensions-escalate.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/05/us-considers-blacklisting-chinas-largest-chipmaker-as-tech-tensions-escalate.html)\n\nWhat's that? They're a partially government owned company that manufactures semiconductors for companies like Qualcomm ($QCOM), Broadcom ($AVGO), and Texas Instruments ($TXN)\n\nWith tech overbought on a level not seen since the dot-com bubble and the China trade war potentially cutting off one of the key manufacturers of semiconductors to the three major companies that can make 5g chipsets, I'm not very bullish on technology right now.\n\nThe SoC used to implement wireless modems in most of our mobile devices is made by $QCOM and they rely on SMIC to manufacture it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-smic/qualcomm-turns-to-chinas-smic-for-snapdragon-chip-production-idUSKBN0F825Y20140703](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-smic/qualcomm-turns-to-chinas-smic-for-snapdragon-chip-production-idUSKBN0F825Y20140703)\n\nNot only this but there were major security flaws in Qualcomm chips disclosed recently: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/06/hundreds-of-millions-of-android-phones-can-spy-on-users-as-400-snapdragon-security-flaws-confirmed-qualcomm-google-lg-samsung-oneplus/#336b149660b2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/06/hundreds-of-millions-of-android-phones-can-spy-on-users-as-400-snapdragon-security-flaws-confirmed-qualcomm-google-lg-samsung-oneplus/#336b149660b2) \n\nAlso, Qualcomm's modems are not only found in Android devices: [https://www.macworld.com/article/3527277/qualcomm-x60-5g-modem-apple-iphone.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/3527277/qualcomm-x60-5g-modem-apple-iphone.html) \n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138264/apple-5g-antenna-qualcomm-x55-modem-mmwave-iphone-2020-rumor](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138264/apple-5g-antenna-qualcomm-x55-modem-mmwave-iphone-2020-rumor)\n\nbut also the iPhone, and they're making the 5g modem for the iPhone too.\n\nSo you can see why the stock has run up so high! The China trade war will slow 5g adoption, and short term this will be bad for tech stocks.\n\nHave a look at my shitty $QCOM TA, and see how this is unprecedented this is. There there is plenty of room for it to fall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou7rq8y50gl51.png?width=3070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb90639560032efd2beff4340e504299fd482e4b\n\nWe could see the biggest tech plunge since the .com bust. Don't believe me? Fine, keep buying calls because stocks only go up.\n\nOverbought Stocks + China Scare = 2018 all over again = buy some fucking puts\n\n**How to play it:**\n\nFor the short term play:\n\nQCOM $100P 9/25\n\nFor the mid-term play (this means you think the bubble will pop, which btw makes you a full on \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b)\n\nQCOM $70P 1/15/2021",

There are non-auto companies who have skateboards, in need of actual car companies to built on top of it. \n\nLook up Benteler, who in cooperation with Bosch, built an EV skateboard.

        "selftext": "This confirms months of speculation...here are the initial thoughts from analysts.\n\n**Needham** \\- \"Will It Be Game Changing? We Shall See.\"\n\n\"We believe the acquisition represents a big risk but with potential huge awards. From a financial perspective, this acquisition is the largest deal in NVIDIA's history. We are not concerned about the size of the deal because NVIDIA generated $4.3BN of free cash flow in FY20 and is on track to generate $5.2BN in FY21, and hence we expect it to make up the $12BN in cash fairly quickly, even without a contribution from Arm. Additionally, the dilution represents only 7% of total shares - not a major event, in our view.\"\n\n\"Strategically, we believe there are several advantages: in the near-term, Arm IP is ubiquitous in the mobile phone and tablet markets with 95% share. NVDA can harvest that steady cash flow stream to finance growth. ARM has a cumulative number of licenses signed of 1,767 as of F4Q19 and 22.8 billion royalty units as reported by licensee. Longer-term, Arm is gaining inroads in the all the major secular growth drivers in technology including cloud and infrastructure equipment, edge IoT, robotics and self-driving vehicles. Arm technology is being used in advanced MCUs for IoT devices such as communication chips and sensors and broad range of networking equipment.\"\n\n\"On the skeptical side of the equation, we wonder about the anti-trust factors as Arm is the \"Arms-dealer\" in the semiconductor industry with a long list of customers, which include competitors, such as TI, MRVL, AMD, IFX, QCOM, AAPL, Samsung, NXPI, AVGO and others. We also need to have a better understanding of the long-term revenue ramp and overall TAM. Arm's net sales have been lackluster for the past two fiscal years, growing 3% in FY19 and declining in FY18 due to deterioration in overall business conditions in the semiconductor industry.\"\n\n**Jefferies**\u00a0\\- \"NVDA + ARM = $50 EPS Power in 2025\"\n\n\" We view the deal as transformative, positioning NVDA not just to capture 80% of the ecosystem value in the data center, but also unify the compute ecosystem between the edge and data center. We think the merged company has a 5-yr EPS power of $50, and increase our price target to $680, and bull-case to $1,000.\"\n\n\"We estimate the deal to be slightly accretive the first year after close.\"\n\n\"Transformative Deal - Heterogeneous Data Center Scale Solution Provider: In previous computing eras, one ecosystem typically controlled 80% of the profits of the ecosystem \u2013 in PCs it was Wintel, in Smartphones it is Apple. Due to the ecosystem it has created in Acceleration (processor, interconnect (MLNX), software stack including CUDA and vertical market software), we\u2019ve argued that Nvidia was best positioned to capture 80% of the profits of the Parallel Processing Era. However, with ARM, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem as well. We also think that ARM gives it a larger moat in the data center.\"\n\n\"Transformative Deal - Unifying the Edge with the Data Center: the Cell Phone / Server Computing Era was the first where compute bifurcated, and two separate ecosystems operated in parallel (Apple\u2019s ecosystem in the Smartphone, and Wintel in the data center). Should Nvidia successfully acquire ARM, then the compute ecosystem will be unified from edge to data center, and we would expect Nvidia to offer more highly integrated compute solutions across the entire compute ecosystem, and realize the lion\u2019s share of the profits in this 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing.\"\n\n\"Five-year EPS Power of $50. We believe this is a differentiated interpretation of NVidia's earnings potential which stems from our view that Nvidia is supplying an ecosystem in the data center, much like Apple supplies to the smart phone market, or Intel and Microsoft did in PCs. In contrast to other traditional semiconductor competitors, Nvidia's ecosystem extends beyond processors, to high speed interconnect (MLNX) and a software stack. During the PC Era, Microsoft's PC operating profit was similar to Intel's, and we think Nvidia's earnings potential framework should be modeled more like Wintel, with half of its earnings power coming from the ecosystem that it created. We model Nvidia Data Center processor revenues of $34bn in 2025, and Data Center Ecosystem (software) of an additional $34bn.\"\n\n**RBC -** \"We continue to believe the same three major points: 1) biggest hurdle in our view is approval/official closing of transaction; 2) if the transaction closes, we think this would be a notable negative for Intel and a notable positive for Nvidia; and 3) with Apple, Amazon, and now Nvidia, a robust software ecosystem is ready to support an ARM-based server environment over the long term.\"\n\n\" What do Apple and Nvidia have in common? Access to successful software ecosystems. Since x86 has been the dominant player in the server market, Nvidia could argue that the transaction would create more competition against the x86 market. Currently, the market is largely Intel \\~85\u201390% (x86) and AMD 8\u201310% (x86) and a few points \u201cOther\u201d depending on how one defines the total market. If Nvidia puts research and development dollars behind the transaction, an ecosystem to compete against x86 would be possible, in our view, given Nvidia\u2019s success with CUDA. Finally, AWS has a new Graviton product based on ARM architecture. It is arguably a stable/solid alternative given its lower power consumption. We\u2019ve seen this story twice in the past in the Flops/Watt (GPU&gt;CPU) and TCO (AMD&gt;INTC\"\n\n**Raymond James** \\- \" As we had suspected earlier, much of the justification for the deal in the presentation centers on the datacenter market. Based on our initial read of the presentation, we view this as an assault on Intel\u2019s server CPU business. The intention would seem to be to become able to offer server customers a broader roadmap that covers both CPU, GPU and server. It\u2019s yet unclear however about how a NVDA datacenter business that would offer server CPUs benefit from NVDA owning ARM as opposed to simply being a licensee. Nonetheless, we do view this as a move on NVDA\u2019s part to compete more fully with both INTC and AMD in the server pace. MRVL is also an ARM licensee for server CPUs, but since MRVL has already announced that they would only pursue custom server CPU engagements going forward, we don\u2019t expect much impact to MRVL. Undoubtedly, the combination of ARM\u2019s leading processor IP with NVDA\u2019s GPU and AI IP will create a powerful combination. But it\u2019s not immediately clear how NVDA intends to leverage having ARM under their own ownership, and will expect that vision to be part of the company\u2019s presentation.\n\n\"The presentation notes that NVDA intends to continue ARM\u2019s open licensing model and NVDA IP would also be added to ARM\u2019s licensing business. That could certainly become additive to the revenue for the total licensing business, but more details will need to be provided to understand the potential revenue synergies.\"\n\n\"The transaction requires regulatory approval the U.K., China, the European Union and the United States. China approval will naturally be viewed as a risk given US/China trade tensions. Since ARM IP is the foundation of nearly all handsets and IOT devices, we would expect the deal to be highly scrutinized, and we would expect that NVDA would need to provide assurances that it will continue an open licensing model. NVDA is an ARM licensee, but ARM processors is a small part of NVDA\u2019s business, limited to the automotive business (3% of revenue) and the Nintendo Switch custom processor (4% of revenue, by our estimates). Therefore, since there is a very small part of revenue in which NVDA competes with ARM licensees, we don\u2019t expect that to raise significant regulatory concerns.\"",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 2, 2020**\n\nStocks open September with the bang, as tech continued rallying and benchmarks ended in all-time highs. This is an encouraging start to what is usually a rough month for traders. Both the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Nasdaq set new records on Tuesday, underpinned by the continuing rally in technology shares like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN)  and Microsoft ($MSFT) \u2014 which both soared after their stocks split on Monday help boost market sentiment.\n\nThe S&amp;P finished that day 0.97% up, the NASDAQ finished 1.8% up and the DOW finished 0.85% up. Great day for the markets overall!\n\nGoldman Sachs ($GS) said, \u201cwhile equities have never been as expensive since the Tech bubble, based on a 24-month \\[price/earnings basis\\], the equity risk premium is close to an all-time high, suggesting that equities have rarely been as attractive relative to bonds.\u201d Moreover, July\u2019s economic data in labor and manufacturing broadly overperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates suggesting the market could get even \u2018boomier\u2019, according to JP Morgan ($JPM).\n\nTraders are encouraged by the Fed\u2019s new policy, which promises economic support for as long as necessary, and declining numbers of Coronavirus cases in Southern states like Georgia and Florida, which recently became epicenters for the virus.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The ISM Manufacturing Index hitting its highest levels since August 2018.\n* Piper Sandler lifted price target for $ZEN Zendesk Inc from $87 to $123\n* Wedbush increased the price target for $CMG Chipotle Mexican Grill from $1,320 to $1,600\n* $WFC Wells Fargo raised their price target for $QCOM Qualcomm, Inc. from $90 to $120\n* $GS Goldman Sachs raised Price Target of $ZM Zoom Communications from $187 to $402. Shares are up an incredible 40% since earnings report yesterday after the bell on a BLOWOUT quarter.\n* Precious metals once again underperformed. Miners ($GDX) were down 1.42%, Gold ($IAU) was down 0.24% and Silver ($SLV) was down 0.42%\n\n**Notable Earnings for tomorrow, tomorrow, Sept 2:** China Petroleum ($SNP), Copart ($CPRT), Crowdstrike Holdings ($CRWD), GSX Techedu ($GSX), Huazhu Group ($HTHT), Korea Electric Power ($KEP), Mongodb Inc ($MDB), Rocket Companies Inc ($RKT)",
