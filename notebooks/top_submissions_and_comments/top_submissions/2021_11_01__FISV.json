        "selftext": "Here are Parts 2 - 4 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) covers Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, and an expected miss for Q3ER.  I recommend starting with the [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) in Part 1, and following the links if still interested.\n\n# 2. Debt\n\nPaysafe\u2019s recent acquisitions have spawned several misleading claims using faulty numbers to generate doubt about the company\u2019s ability to manage debt.For example:\n\n* One article tried to make a specific case that Paysafe can\u2019t cover debt due to Q2\u2019s 46% free cash flow conversion rate. The author's acrobatic bias ignores the obvious fact that the Q2 balance sheet clearly states a year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate of 70%, not 46%. The CFO noted that Q2\u2019s conversion rate was temporarily affected by a one-time tax payment that is to be partially refunded. (Notably, Q1\u2019s free cash flow conversion rate was 96%. At $108 million, it was a 28% YoY increase.)\n* Another article cries liquidity problems, citing, \u201cPaysafe Ltds earnings cannot cover its interest expense. If the situation continues, the company may have to issue more debt.\u201d By relying on websites that blindly auto-calculate debt service ratios, the article doesn't account for recent debt restructuring and dramatically misrepresents forward expenses by ignoring:\n\n1. $84 million in one-time merger related expenses will not be repeated,\n2. over $40 million in one-time debt restructuring fees will not be repeated,\n3. newly reduced interest expenses resulting in roughly [$70 million](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) in annualized savings.\n\n* A third article mistakenly claims Paysafe, \u201cwill add another $1 billion in net debt to close the Latin America deals.\u201d  In truth, the two deals mentioned total $550 million (SafetyPay at [$441m](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005095/en/Paysafe-to-Acquire-SafetyPay/) and Pago Efectivo at [$108.5m](https://www.alantra.com/ib-transaction/grupo-el-comercio-sell-side-advisory-pagoefectivo-paysafe/)). A third European acquisition, viafintech, is [reported](https://finanz-szene.de/payments/der-2-exit-von-barzahlen-doch-was-ist-seit-dem-1-exit-passiert/) to be valued at $42.5 million euros ($49 million USD). While the three deals total roughly $598 million, much of that can be covered between Paysafe\u2019s $247.8 million in cash, their $270 million in undrawn revolving credit and their $360-$430 million in free cash flow. Total added debt will likely be less than half of what the article assumes. (In fairness, the author later admitted he read the transcript wrong.)\n\nAfter paying down $1.2 billion in debt in Q1, Paysafe used its two notch credit rating upgrade from [Moody\u2019s](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Paysafe-to-B1-stable-outlook--PR_443474) and [S&amp;P](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) to reorganize remaining debt, extend maturity and significantly lower average interest rates, reducing interest expenses by $70 million. The result, inclusive of new debt from acquisitions: credit upgrades were reaffirmed along with a $305 million revolving credit facility and the company will save around $43 million in annualized interest expense.This means forward debt-related costs are on track to drop by more than half, from an estimated $165 million in 2021 to less than $80 million in 2022. Combined with $84 million in other non-recurring merger-related expenses, that\u2019s over $160 million in cost reductions going forward.Strong free cash flow and over $160 million in reduced costs can go a long way to quickly paying down debt. Add in the expected acquisition growth synergies and the company\u2019s quoted path to a 35% EBITDA margin, and the picture looks even better.  Management noted, \u201cthe deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d  The very realistic potential of 17-18% revenue growth could attain that target ratio in short order.All this points to sustainable deleveraging, paving the way for more growth through M&amp;A. (It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the company stands to take in more than half a billion cash from outstanding warrants, which will directly benefit enterprise value and inorganic growth potential.)Carrying large debt is extremely common in the Fintech sector and Paysafe is by no means an outlier here. (Square, Repay, Fiserv, Shift4, Affirm, Bill and Paysign all have worse debt/EBITDA ratios and most of them still have negative earnings). In itself, debt leverage is not a bad thing, particularly if it\u2019s manageable and generates more growth. That definitely appears to be the case here.\n\n# 3. Profit\n\nWhen considering how Paysafe is setting itself up for future profit potential, here are some points worth underscoring:\n\n* Without $92 million in non-recurring costs, Q1 would have been very profitable, beating analysts consensus by as much +0.10 EPS.\n* Despite Q2\u2019s $40 million in non-repeating costs, Paysafe still managed to beat on earnings with its first profitable quarter as a newly public company.\n* Roughly $167 million in H1 expenses will not repeat going forward:\n\n1. $84m one-time share based compensation,\n2. $40m one-time accelerated capitalized debt fees,\n3. $43m estimated reduction in annual interest expenses\n\n* Those reductions alone represent a potential +0.22 EPS, which exceeds analysts projections.  (Some platforms have reported analysts estimate 3-400% profit growth for 2022 with an average of 75% annual profit growth thereafter.  Fortunately, on Q3 guidance, analysts have been revising their forward estimates downwards which ultimately better positions PSFE to beat consensus down the road. This contrasts with analysts\u2019 initial EPS estimates which did not appear to fully account for the one-time merger and debt restructuring costs.)\n* Paysafe\u2019s margins are also expected to expand as they work through deliberate measures to de-risk future growth.  For example, their integrated processing take rate has been compressed by strategic Direct Marketing exits in anticipation of new compliance rules. This is expected to abate by end of year.  Management notes: \u201cwe do expect EBITDA margins to expand in the back-half of the year and to continue that like a steady drumbeat going into next year as well\u201d reflecting \u201ccontinued strength in integrated processing, including the on-boarding of several new e-commerce clients in late Q3 and early Q4, stronger growth in digital wallet as well as sequential improvement in direct marketing.\u201d\n* Between Q3 and FY guidance, there is an implied guidance for a Q4 EBITDA of $153 million.  That represents a YoY EBITDA growth of 60.5%, which may offer a signal as to how moving beyond legacy de-risking headwinds can start to improve the margin picture going forward.\n* Their fastest growing segment, eCash, has a high take rate of 7.2%.  For H1/21, they reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth which would reasonably point to a future business mix with higher overall margins.  Further growth in this segment stands to benefit from their new LATAM expansion, their new Glory Ltd partnership, as well as their recently launched US [campaign](https://www.skrill.com/es-us/enviar-transferir-dinero-mexico/?utm_source=tv&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=DIEGOSMT) to engage the US/Mexico remittance market (worth [$40 billion](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-migrants-home-record-40-billion-2020-75642052) annually). Also, their [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) deal expands eCash in 22 countries and their recent deals with [ZEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-extends-partnership-zen-com-080000606.html), [REPAY](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), and [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/) further expands their eCash network across the US and in 25 European countries.\n* With a gross margin of 61-63%, upon execution of their two year strategy to \u201cunlock over $100m organic adj. EBITDA\u201d ([page 28](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)), management cites a potential \u201cpro forma upside that could drive EBITDA CAGR to 21%.\u201d\n* One aspect of this margin expansion strategy is in the company\u2019s ongoing integration of their various business segments into a single code on a cloud-based gateway, the Unity Platform. This streamlining will enable them to reduce costs and scale up quickly in new markets and in emerging verticals like travel, [trading in the wallet](https://coinquora.com/paysafes-neteller-adds-fiat-to-crypto-feature-on-its-platform/), digital goods, online gaming, and banking as a service.  Among the benefits of this new synthesis:\n\n1. it increases operating margins through cost-saving efficiencies and eliminating redundancies (automating underwriting, 2/3 reduction in data centers)\n2. it enables them to forward unsolicited cost savings to partners, merchants and users, helping them retain and gain new marketshare,\n3. it eliminates on-boarding each service separately by making their entire suite automatically available through a single gateway, which builds in substantial cross-selling opportunities\n\n# 4. Float\n\nThe number of institutional funds owning PSFE has grown from 187 to 297 over the last quarter. At this point, nearly all the major funds hold shares at a cost basis much higher than the current price. These include Wells Fargo, Blackrock, Citigroup, State Street, JP Morgan, Francisco Partners, Naya Capital and noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point), David Tepper (Appaloosa), Aaron Cohen (Survetta), Seth Rosen (Nitorum) and Leon Cooperman, (who personally owns over a million shares). Notably, most of these investors bought shares before Paysafe\u2019s [recent history](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/) of value creation.  Cross-referencing the most up to date [record](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) with older filings, some [estimate](https://solarpvinvestor.com/topic/3255-paysafe-holdings-psfe/?tab=comments#comment-103030) the true available float is between 70-80 million shares. For what has historically been a low beta stock, theoretically, a reduced free float influences the proportionate affect of true short interest and could cause the stock price to move faster.  \n\n\nLinks to the rest of the article can be found in [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) once they are complete.

A third European acquisition, viafintech, is [reported](https://finanz-szene.de/payments/der-2-exit-von-barzahlen-doch-was-ist-seit-dem-1-exit-passiert/) to be valued at $42.5 million euros ($49 million USD).

However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) with Paysafe\u2019s March 31 20F ([p.124](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares.\n\nIt\u2019s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2.  BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you\u2019d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone\u2019s 13F and whether they\u2019d sold shares, Paysafe\u2019s investor relations responded, \"That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing. \u00a0It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock.\"\n\nMake of it what you will, but there\u2019s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC.\n\nOther factors to consider about Blackstone\u2019s stake:\n\n* Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment.  In truth, as Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP), Paysafe, \u201cwas taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.\u201d At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that\u2019s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (\u00a32.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That\u2019s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.).\n* This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC [paid](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/30924/blackstonecvc-agree-296-billion-deal-for-paysafe) \u201ca 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,\u201d because, as Reuter\u2019s [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a/paysafe-backs-3-9-billion-offer-from-blackstone-cvc-group-idUSKBN1AK0KN), insiders close to the deal said private equity had \u201ca decade-long thesis that the shift to \\[digital payments\\] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d This \u201cdecade-long\u201d thesis matches Blackstone\u2019s typical investment term of \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d according to their published [white paper](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf). 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their [proxy statement](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf) when approving the business combination (see #9).\n* More recently, Reuters [reported](https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idINKBN28H1GP): \u201cMartin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.\u201d Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n* And last month, CEO Philip McHugh [assured](https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-digitalbanking-paysafe#/): \u201cYou won\u2019t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we\u2019re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in crypto, in travel and online gaming.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6. Insider Ownership\n\nBears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe\u2019s [share registration](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) confirms this argument is another non-starter:\n\n* CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares\n* COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares\n* Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares\n* Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares\n* 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 7. Competition\n\nBears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe\u2019s lunch, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they\u2019re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and [real-time pay-in/pay-out](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skrill-usa-enhances-digital-wallet-080000953.html), which they say \u201cfills a gap in the U.S. market.\u201d\n\nSome theorize that Paysafe\u2019s competitive threat is the reason it\u2019s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company\u2019s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested.\n\nSpeculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions.\n\nThis last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: \u201cBecause it\u2019s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that\u2019s easy to copy.\u201d He further notes, \u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nPaysafe\u2019s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding [model](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Safeguarding-the-future-of-travel.pdf). It\u2019s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe\u2019s [award winning](https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2021/05/31/57794-paysafe-wins-payments-provider-award) platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators).\n\nOften embedded behind the scenes so that customers don\u2019t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with [MasterCard](https://www.mastercard.com/news/europe/en-uk/newsroom/press-releases/en-gb/2020/march/paysafe-and-mastercard-extend-strategic-partnership/), Visa, Fiserv, [WorldPay](https://www.infinicept.com/payment-facilitator/archive/game-on-for-worldpay-and-paysafe/)(US DraftKings), [Apple Pay](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/apple-pay/), [Google Pay](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/google-pay/), [PayPal](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/payment-methods/paypal/), [Sightline](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/payment-methods/sightline/), REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the [award](https://www.paysafe.com/de-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-wins-two-payments-awards/) winning [Coinbase/Visa](https://www.thepower50.com/paysafe-issues-coinbases-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/) card.  In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe\u2019s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting.  It\u2019s often easier for a \"competitor\" to just give them a cut of the take.  CEO McHugh notes, \u201cThat\u2019s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.\u201d  And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, \u201cIn Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.\u201d\n\nRather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone.  This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as \u201cubiquitous. It\u2019s just everywhere.\u201d\n\nHaving cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in \u201chard to do, hard to copy\u201d niche verticals. CEO McHugh: \u201cThat\u2019s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.\u201d\n\nThrough its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large [suite](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521055290/d18419df4a.htm) of interconnected products and payment rails:\n\n* credit and debit card processing\n* integrated eCommerce processing\n* online banking with real-time bank payments\n* ACH check transactions\n* digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality\n* person to person payments in 40 currencies\n* eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base\n* 38 cryptocurrencies in over 90 markets\n* trading crypto and stocks in the wallet\n* international money transfers\n* branded gift card management\n* recurring billing\n* data mining for targeted direct marketing\n* travel safeguarding for most major airlines\n* tokenization and encryption (NFTs)\n* in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes)\n\nAs the CEO points out, \u201cMerchants just want sales regardless of payment method\u2026There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products\u2026we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market\u2026The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well.\"\n\n# Reviews:\n\nWhile on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren\u2019t aware of Paysafe\u2019s award winning consumer products like [Paysafecard](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PAYSAFE-LIMITED-120977165/news/Paysafe-Paysafecard-wins-Hermes-Business-Award-2021-36750942/) and [Skrill](https://www.paymentexpert.com/2019/11/01/skrill-wins-best-digital-wallet-at-juniper-research-2019-awards/), often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript \u201cPaysafe\u201d with only 287 reviews.\n\nMeanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe\u2019s actual consumer-facing products like:\n\n* Paysafecard: \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) [43K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n* Skrill: \u201cgreat\u201d (4/5 stars) [19K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skrill.com)\n* Skrill Money Transfer: \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) [9K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/transfers.skrill.com)\n\nBy contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors:\n\n* PayPal: \u201cbad\" (1.2/5 stars) [20K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n* Stripe: \u201cAverage\u201d (3.3/5 stars) [6.6K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/stripe.com)\n* Cash App: \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars) [3K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/cash.app)\n* Zelle: \u201cbad\u201d (1.1/5 stars) [398 reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/zellepay.com)\n* Venmo: \u201cbad\u201d (1.3/5 stars) [281 reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/venmo.com)\n\nNote: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless. To be fair, those competing platforms get much better Apple mobile app reviews but, even there, Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill gets a respectable, [4.4 out of 5 stars](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skrill-pay-transfer-money/id718248239) with 7.2K ratings. And at GooglePlay, their Paysafecard get 4.3/5 stars with over [103K reviews](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.paysafecard.android&amp;referrer=adjust_reftag%3DcIGmAvoU2TFcK%26utm_source%3DWebsite%2B-%2BApp%2BSeite).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a link to the next part go to [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/).
