Here's the purchase and sells for that.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sydwpsu5qox71.png?width=2166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6978d7dbef473cf6bff7c69067c43d41e291276d\n\nShit man! I had some fucking money! I made all my losses back plus an extra 10k or so. I finally accomplished something in my life! Why would I want it to end there though? I want more. So much more.  \n\n\nNvidia and SPY have been doing great as well so I started to buy calls for those as well.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kca4cu5csox71.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=904f07848209847bb7dd0e936128a51e0f283064\n\nGolly gee! I'm high on a rush of gambling so I needed to continue. This put me at about 60k or so total. I took profit where I could and thats the way you should always play it.\n\nIt's not enough though. We gotta keep going don't we? It's NVIDIA time!  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8mtg5w0tox71.png?width=2171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8a66323c1bd2b8c4ba35dd6587a4c2c51809289\n\nIt is now November 3rd I have around 125000 in my RH account. Lifes good, but life can be great too. Here's where I YOLO this 100,000 to nearly make myself a millionaire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3be9y3rtox71.png?width=2146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca2ce0731639b2ccf55bde373f51e5aa40106884\n\nIt happened. I made a shit ton of money. My dad didn't believe me. I didn't believe it. I'm glad I sold before the big dip today. Currently, my account is at:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vt6kuhzytox71.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc2f147fb51c55278958befa9b546fe2c7d34ab\n\nBut peaked at \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivatzc51uox71.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e870da631a359c63ec339e781dd2f527092c9c9c\n\nI am just blown away. If it wasn't for WSB, shitposting, losing money, I would never have made this achievement. Can't forgot JPow either. Thanks!  \n\n\np.s. My current positions remaining are 100 310c 11/5 (down 64k) and 13 300c 11/5 (put 200 order in but didnt fill) I also am still holding SPY 400 266c 11/5.  \nSo, in 14 days, I raised my account by 680,000 for a 17,250% gain since Oct 5.\n\nIn between all of these options I did place some which either made so little difference or even lost money but overall I felt it didn't matter to put them in. Yes I couldve held some of the earlier ones longer for a way bigger profit, but sometimes you gotta take what you got and work with it.",

        "selftext": "Background: I\u2019ve been trading options for over a decade and I have no financial or business background. I learned before it was popular online and I am self taught. So I\u2019ll be explaining it the way I was able to understand it. There are better ways, but this is what helped me. I turned $1700 into $500,000 back in 2014. \n\n\nOptions are basically lay aways for shares. So let\u2019s use a house as an example. \n\nIf you bought a house for $1M and I come and offer you $1.2M (the strike price). The catch is I have a certain amount of time to decide if I want the house. You cannot back out but I\u2019m not obligated to buy it. So what\u2019s in it for you? I offer you a $10,000 deposit that you get to keep no matter what happens. Now what? \n\n\nI hold a CONTRACT between us that costed $10,000 and I give myself 6 month expiration date to decide if I want it. So now I am hoping the housing market goes up above $1.2M so let\u2019s go over a few scenarios. \n\nBenefit? I profit on a $1M house as if I own it even though I only paid $10,000. \n\nMARKET RISES\n1. The housing market goes up and it\u2019s now worth $1.4M within 3 months giving me 3 more months on the contract. So the contract is worth at least $200,000 because if I forced you to sell it (exercise). So I can go around and sell the contract to someone else and say \u201clook I can force them to sell for $200,000 today, so give me $200,000 + $20,000 for the 3 months because it could continue to rise. So they pay $200,000 to receive $200,000 in equity and $20,000 premium because the contract still has more time. Meaning if the housing market goes up to 1.5M The new owner of the contract can now exercise the contract (option) and profit $80,000 or 4X their investment. \n\n MARKET DIPS\n2. The housing market dips and the house is now worth $800,000. I would owe you $1.2M so I just wait the 6 months and hope it rises or I sell my contract $10,000 at a loss maybe like $3,000 to someone else hoping it jumps back up. Worse case if the time comes to an end i lose $10,000. \n\nMARKET RISES BUT NOT MUCH. \n1. You do not have to hit the price you bet to earn money. So if the market hits $1.1M within 1 month since there is 5 months left. I can sell the contract to someone else for more now thst it\u2019s more likely to happen. So I can get $20,000 even though it didn\u2019t go over $1.2M. I\u2019m selling the contract to someone else and letting them hope it goes up. \n\nNow translating to stocks. \n\n1 option or contract is 100 shares per contract. \n\nSo if you buy 6 contracts for apple to hit $300 you have 600 shares on hold for you. Every dollar above $300 you earn $600. Because you only owe the owner $300 so everything above is yours. \n\n\nSo your call is you betting it goes up, and if you do a put, you are betting it goes down. Either way you will only ever lose the initial deposit or purchase price of the contract. \n\nStock example I bet Nvidia will hit $360 by feb22 so I needed to pay the owner $15 per share as a down payment. So it was $1500 for the 1 option. Now the closer it gets to the price I said it would hit the price of the contract goes up because it\u2019s now more likely to happen. \n\nSo for example if I said your house will hit $2M by 3 months you wouldn\u2019t believe it would happen so you would accept a lower deposit say $1000 now imagine something happens and 1 week later your house jumps to $1.4M. Since it\u2019s more likely to happen I could sell the contract to someone else for $2500 because it\u2019s not as crazy and I\u2019ve made 150% in 2 weeks. \n\nYou don\u2019t hold a contract till the date, you flip the contract to someone else when you make money on the deposit. \n\nHow are they priced? The crazier your bet the cheaper it is. Tesla at $2000 within 2 months is probably impossible so it would be cheap. Tesla at $2000 by 2024 is more likely so it would cost more. \n\nI turned $1700 into $500,000 from options at 19 back in 2014. But I\u2019ve also lost $100,000 in a day when fedex dipped when gas was low because they buy gas in 6 month intervals. So their earnings were low and the stock dipped. With not that much time left I lost it all. So if it\u2019s your first time, give your self some time in the expiration date . So be careful.",

        "selftext": "I posted this as a reply to a thread in WallStreetBets.  I thought someone might find it useful.\n\nThe stocks you pick to trade options also matter a great deal.  For example; I prefer NVDA &amp; TSLA lately because they often recover very well from selloffs and will give you clearer direction.  Both obviously are popular and their profitability will continue to bring in more buyers.  Also, they are volatile and move well in both directions with NVDA being the easier of the two to trade.  \n\nIf you have been losing money trading options because of volatility, getting shaken out, stress, etc then the following strategy may help.  Determine the latest hot sector of the market i.e. energy, financials, retail, etc and trade options in the corresponding ETF.  For example XLE - Energy, XLF - Financials, etc.  These ETFs can still make you good money and won't move dramatically in either position.  They can help you learn the mechanics and make money at the same time without exhausting your mental energy.\n\nMy personal basic strategy is to find the ITM call or put that has the highest open interest and volume.  These usually have the tightest spreads and make it easy for me to move in and out.\n\nTry not to focus on the P/L, as you will get shaken out easily, but rather trade the chart. Sell half of your position at predetermined resistance levels that lose momentum without hesitation.  This will ensure profitable trades. \n\nAlso, if you are newer to options trading then I recommend only trading 1 contract at a time as this will keep your stress level down and allow you understand how the particular stock/option you are in behaves.  (Yes, they have their own behavior lol). \n\nIf you are more of an intermediate trader then slowly add to your position.  If i intend to buy 10 contracts I will add 1-2 at the point when I get to my target entry.  Often times what we believe is a great entry will temporarily break down and offer us a better entry.  This is when I will add more.  If I don't get the small capitulation move down then i add on the way up.  All of this is fine and never beat yourself up for not getting it \"perfect\".\n\nThese are the lessons I've learned and allow me to consistently make money and trade for a living.",

        "selftext": "In spirit, not in numbers. Not saying INTC is going to become a 2.5T megacap company like MSFT, but I'll lay it out.\n\nFor those who don't know MSFT was a stagnant stock for many, many years. If you bought MSFT at the peak in 1999, you would not have broken even until 2016. 17 years. But of course the stock broke through big time and is now the most(?) valuable company in the world.\n\nI see a sort of similar trajectory for Intel. Right now, Intel is the chip dinosaur. They have massive revenues, but limited growth. For context, Intel does $20B in revenue per quarter while Nvidia does $20B per year. Apples to oranges as Intel is stagnant while Nvidia is growing rapidly, but it's something to understand.\n\nIntel rested on their laurels, as they had the semiconductor market pretty locked down for a long time.  AMD was a joke of a company, and Nvidia was emerging as the leader in a technology that didn't exist until the last 20 years (GPUs). Intel could just chill, collect oodles of cash, pay their executives a ridiculous amount, and everyone was fat and happy. Until AMD actually started competing. It caught Intel flat footed, and it can be seen in the quality of Intel's products of late. AMD has actually been better than Intel in CPU, and competing with Nvidia in GPU.\n\nBut now, Intel is doing something about it and they have a unique advantage. Vertical integration. Intel does not only make the end product, they actually fabricate the semiconductors. In a chip shortage world with a big US government willing to doll out crazy sums of money, this is a huge deal. Intel is already investing tens of billions of dollars in new semiconductor fab plants, which will help address the largest supply chain issue in modern history.\n\nBeyond this, Intel has just released their desktop CPU chips which beat AMD across the board in performance. While desktop CPUs are a small portion of Intel's business, this shows progress. This along with their expansion plans in semiconductor fabrication, AND a new CEO that has major growth ambition for the company, I see this as one of the best investment opportunities in the market today.\n\nLast point, Intel is trading at a disgustingly cheap 9.8 P/E ratio. The market has not factored in Intel's impending growth, and this makes them a sleeping giant similar in spirit to Microsoft.",

        "selftext": "Hi fellow retards, been a fellow lurker for a few years now but decided to post because I recently shifted my stance on $INTC and figured I should get the full smooth-brain experience by getting roasted by my fellow apes.  \n\nI figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intel\u2019s strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. \n\nFirst of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&amp;D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how they\u2019ve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). \n\nOn the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is \u201ca threat to our economic security\u2014and by extension, to our national security\u201d](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. \n\nThere is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if you\u2019re also smooth brained, you likely know it\u2019s INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china want\u2019s to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). \n\nYou know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and they\u2019ve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).\n\nIntel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm",

        "selftext": "TLDR:  I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a  selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.\n\n# Observations/Assumptions\n\nBefore  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.\n\n* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.\n* For most people it is impossible to time the market\n* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.\n* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.\n* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)\n* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)\n* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).\n* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)\n* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.\n* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.\n* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:\n   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.\n   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don\u2019t want to support.\n   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nUsing  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.\n\n# Experiment 2020\n\n750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies\u2019 average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:\n\n* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1\n* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2\n* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3\n\nFor  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.\n\nThis was done for all of the metrics below:\n\n* ROE\n* Revenue Growth %\n* EBITDA %\n* FCF %\n\nThe  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.\n\nAny stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.\n\n[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)\n\nROE Example\n\nThat left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.\n\nThis  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?\n\nThat left 26 across 7 sectors.\n\n[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)\n\n**2020 Industry Breakdown**\n\nThese  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.\n\n2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\nCan we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.\n\n# Experiment 2021\n\n2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:\n\n* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company\n* Profit Margin \u2013 shows how effective the business is at making money\n* Operating Margin \u2013 shows how much money the company earns on its revenue\n* FCF Margin \u2013 shows how efficient a company is with their cash\n* EBITDA Margin \u2013 shows a companies\u2019 operating profitability\n* ROE \u2013 shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money\n* ROA \u2013 shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits\n* ROIC \u2013 shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns\n* Debt/Equity Ratio \u2013 shows the financial stability of a company\n\nMore  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:\n\n\u00b7  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.\n\nEach  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%,  Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.\n\nI  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn\u2019t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.\n\nHere is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:\n\n[Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)\n\nHere is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company\u2019s most recent year):\n\n[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)\n\nHere is an example of the visualizations for the data:\n\n[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)\n\nI  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.\n\nNext,  I read the description of \\~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn\u2019t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it\u2019s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \\~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I\u2019d  need to build a separate model.\n\nI  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \\~75.\n\nWe were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:\n\n[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)\n\nI then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.\n\n2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Industry Classification\n\n* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.\n   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.\n   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren\u2019t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.\n* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.\n   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.\n   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).\n   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.\n\n# 2020 Stocks\n\nABMD\n\nADBE\n\nANET\n\nBWXT\n\nCRL\n\nDG\n\nENR\n\nETSY\n\nEXEL\n\nICLR\n\nISRG\n\nKLAC\n\nLKQ\n\nLRCX\n\nMNST\n\nMPWR\n\nMTCH\n\nOLED\n\nPAYC\n\nPHM\n\nTER\n\nTTD\n\nUI\n\nVEEV\n\nVMW\n\nVRTX\n\n# 2021 Stocks\n\nAAON\n\nAAPL\n\nACN\n\nADBE\n\nAEIS\n\nALGN\n\nAMAT\n\nANET\n\nAPH\n\nATR\n\nATVI\n\nAX\n\nBLD\n\nCDNS\n\nCGNX\n\nCHD\n\nCHE\n\nCORT\n\nCPRT\n\nDLB\n\nDORM\n\nEPAM\n\nESNT\n\nETSY\n\nEW\n\nEXPD\n\nEXPO\n\nFAST\n\nFB\n\nFIX\n\nFOXF\n\nFTNT\n\nGGG\n\nGOOG\n\nGRMN\n\nHEI.A\n\nHELE\n\nIDA\n\nINS\n\nINTC\n\nINTU\n\nIRBT\n\nISRG\n\nCCSI\n\nZD\n\nKLAC\n\nLRCX\n\nLULU\n\nMASI\n\nMED\n\nMKSI\n\nMKTX\n\nMNST\n\nMORN\n\nMPWR\n\nMSFT\n\nNMIH\n\nNRC\n\nNVDA\n\nODFL\n\nOLED\n\nOLLI\n\nPAYC\n\nPAYX\n\nPRLB\n\nQLYS\n\nREGN\n\nRMR\n\nROAD\n\nSCCO\n\nSFBS\n\nSLP\n\nSTMP\n\nTDY\n\nTER\n\nTREX\n\nTROW\n\nTTD\n\nTYL\n\nUI\n\nV\n\nVEEV\n\nVRTX\n\nWAL\n\nYETI\n\n# Notes\n\nI  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. For those that don\u2019t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone! \n\nDuring the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they\u2019re doing which I\u2019m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.\n\nNow let's talk about their evaluation\u2026\n\n1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia\u2019s multiples are leading more than any other company. \n2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants \u201cEvery transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU\u201d While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU\u2019s. \n3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It\u2019s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia\u2019s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company. \n\nI hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!\n\n**EBITDA**, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization",

        "selftext": " Hey all. I\u2019m planning on investing in quantum computing, but I\u2019m a bit torn on where exactly to begin considering its nature as an emerging technology. I come from a computer science background, so I\u2019m fairly comfortable reading about QC itself (and I definitely see how disruptive it could be), but it\u2019s the financial side where I\u2019m a bit lost.\n\nI did my due diligence and read into quantum computing\u2019s overall trend and major commercial applications (e.g. [quantum computing explained for investors](https://frontierresearch.com/quantum-computing/?r=1)) but it\u2019s choosing what specifically to put my money in that I still need help on. Here are some things I\u2019m thinking about:\n\n* I know for a fact that IONQ is performing well right now, but is it a good idea to invest in it now or try and wait for a competitor to be more active in the market to see more movement? (In this case Supernova)\n* Some large cap companies are also getting into quantum computing, such as Google/Alphabet. But should I pick these companies where quantum computing is a side project or stick to companies where it\u2019s the sole focus?\n* Alternatively, there\u2019s always the case of ETFs. There\u2019s [QTUM/Defiance](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/quantum-computing-etf/), which already holds some of the larger cap stocks I\u2019m watching, like AMD and NVDA. Is it safer to go for an EFT or go for the single stocks?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wqj4gjhduz71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bddbb1e3dc073f441c7fb2b3543eecd38c41cda\n\nI\u2019m planning on holding for now and not actively trade, so I\u2019m a bit unsure what would be the right move for long-term returns. Any tips/advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",

All of you who have been buying these stocks, great job, these have been tremendous gains and I hope you get to keep your winnings. But it's time to be real about these companies and the SPY in general. For Tesla+Nvidia,  their combined quarterly revenue isn't even a third of Google's and their quarterly profit isn't even 25% of Google's. Yet they're at the same valuation. And I'd argue Google is also very, very richly valued. \n\nnVidia's P/E is 100. One day the music will stop. For those wondering, look at what happened to Intel and Cisco in 2000. Twenty years later, their revenues have more than tripled and their profits have increased even more, all while buying back millions of shares.

I also believe it's going to become the baby brother of TSLA.\n\n1.5B order book. 2nd most voted EV stock AHEAD of RIVN right under TSLA. Also, read the daily chart. I believe it's going to shoot past 60 this week. Spike of OI on Friday at the $48 c 11/26. I do NOT like weekly's, but this would be a solid play. Safer play is ATM 55c one month out.\n\nCant get long if we drop under 50.  \nCan't get short if go over 55.\n\nEntry PT : 53\n\nSPY - Long  \nReasoning: Do I really need a reason besides daddy JPOW is supplying? Okay. Here's my reasoning.  \nFuck Morgan Stanley's PT. 82% of S&amp;P companies reported good earnings. 500 by January if not by Dec 31st. Been playing SPY for months and make a living off it. I understand how this ETF moves. Buying a super spread out play for 470c/480c/485c for December 31st.\n\nCan't get long if we trade under 466\n\nCan't get short if we trade over 470\n\nEntry PT: 468\n\nMU-Long  \nReasoning: Holy shit this thing is a ticking time bomb. Jumped from 76-83 in 2 days. My 100c LEAP for 400 days out is on fucking fire. Can totally play this weekly, but would reccomend you play this month. This stock is baby NVDA with how it moves and sometimes it will have some shit days, but LEAPS are your friend here.\n\nStill waiting to see what will happen on Monday, but I except 100 easily by January if we blast past previous resistance. Could get shot back down to 75 though.\n\nCan't get short if we trade over 84\n\nCan't get long if we drop back down below 79\n\nEntry PT: 80ish (wiggle room here)\n\nSHOP-Want to get long, probably will be short for 1-3 days  \nReasoning: This is gonna be AMZN's little brother. Options chain has almost the same return ratio as AMZN did on Friday. Buy a 500 call and it runs to 3k in an hour. Amazing financials blah blah, treat this stock like Amazon. Expect huge moves and wild 3 day profit pullbacks.\n\nNo long/short side here, but my entry PT is 1630 at support.\n\nHD-Want to get long, probably will be short for 1-3 days\n\nReasoning: Amazing earnings. Everyone and their mom was whining about it crashing but then I thought, wow 2b in profit? Blackrock sure is gonna need some place around to take care of all those homes they bought. Either way, I made a shitload off my calls from last week.\n\nCan't get long if we go below 395\n\nCan't get short over 405/410\n\nEntry PT: 400 or slightly below.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about my decisions or reasonings please feel free to let me know and share your opinions, either way I hope this helps everyone.",

Intel will also have the advantage of using their new fabs in the future to produce their GPU's whereas Nvidia will be reliant on TSMC/Samsung.\n\nWith AMD also becoming more competitive and both Intel and AMD not being as limited to just the GPU market unlike Nvidia, should people be worried that Nvidia may have to lower profit margins and suffer from lower growth that could make their current price look extremely high?\n\nFor disclosure I do own some INTC and would be interested in NVDA if the valuation was more reasonable.",

        "selftext": "My post simply highlighting Tesla selling 1% of cars globally but being worth more than the other companies combined that sell the other 99%, angered thousands of Tesla investors. Stark and scary real figures to digest.\n\nPerhaps it was the realisation EV sales are exploding to 20% of sales in Europe and China, whilst Tesla mkt share falls to 7% and 9% in the two largest EV markets in the world, in stark contrast to the narrative of it ruling the world of automotive sales via its BEV sales - outside of the US Tesla has been rapidly overtaken in EV sales.\n\nThe most popular response?  ITs NoT A cAR cOMpanY iTs A tecH CoMPany.\n\nTesla has no significant tech related revenues  outside of its own car sales (or very small energy sales).  Its direct additional tech sales to customers remain limited with FSD take up from customers at its lowest reported ever of 11% for the last reported quarter.\n\nNvidia is a tech company for example, that sells car tech business to business.   It sells to Xpeng, its Drive AGX Xavier platform, a (self-driving) system-on-a-chip (SoC), that combined with the LIDAR, ultra sonic sensors, RADAR and camera hardware of XPeng's P5 offers a proper safe level 3 automated driving system - not an level 2, occasional level 3, like Tesla, that relies on predictive algorithms for depth perception because of its reliance on cameras.\n\nIn all sincerity I would recommend Tesla investors look at its filings and business and ask where the business to business, or business to customer tech sales are coming from outside that included in its cars or energy products (i.e. reliant on its falling.EV mkt share or very marginal energy revenues).\n\nRobo-taxis will be the obvious answer from Tesla investors, yet whilst Tesla remains at Level 2/3 and under NHSTA focus, the likes of Waymo are pushing  Level 4/5 under certain conditions and are starting to push genuine robo-taxi services in US cities whilst Elon still just talks it up:\n\nhttps://waymo.com/waymo-one/?loc=sf\n\nJust like the stats show EV competition has arrived and surpassed Tesla in Europe and China, it looks like Tesla will also be beaten to the punch on robo-taxis in the US (other companies like Intel's Mobileye starting next year in Germany and Baidu and other companies are already publicly testing robo-taxis in Chinese cities).",

        "selftext": "Hokay friends and ghouls, \n\nI see a lot of you dumping on INTC. It's a value trap, it's garbage, they missed the boat, they're dependent on TSM, they're a bunch of boomers. Fine. All that's true, but when was all that ever NOT true? And despite them missing the boat all over the place, I'd like to show you all something. \n\n**When in doubt zoom out.** \n\nLet's take a trip down crayon avenue.\n\n[Mmm.... that support line. ](https://preview.redd.it/79ityv404ux71.png?width=2900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffb4644f3f76c4836376878a3c87dcc38d61f0ad)\n\nThe big chart, that's Intel's price history since 2011. \n\nLet's look at the red line that slopes upwards. Beginning November 19th, of 2012 and all the way to October 25th, 2021, INTC's tested its support 11-15 times (depending on what you count as testing and re-testing). Either way, every single time it's tested that support line, it's found its way back to life. EVERY TIME. \n\nMost recently, spring of 2020 when COVID-19 reared its disgusting head. \n\nAfter that, October of 2020 when COVID-19 was making another appearance with Delta. \n\nAnd most recently October of 2021 when INTC had a bit of a negative earnings surprise. \n\nAll the while, $AMD's been making sweet love to the call holders out there. But you know what, AMD can only hang out with you for so long. Money's gotta go somewhere. How about NVDA? Yep, that's was a money maker galore. But it too's gone parabolic. Where else to put those sweet semi tendies? \n\nWell, seems like a lot of the big money is putting that money into INTC. \n\nWhy? Well, take a look at the rebound off the support line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[INTC money flow has been trending downwards, except for the past week. Money flow is going back into the stock. Will it get crazy good? I'm not a fortune teller, but these charts are my tarot cards and they're looking pretty good. ](https://preview.redd.it/h70mv75o5ux71.png?width=2860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=551642db068ffdcc22d840c1fcefde65120b0ddc)\n\nI'm not going to share any other crayons than this. \n\nYou can draw your own Fib retracements from April 12th @ $68 - Oct 28th @ $47 and you'll see something like this: The levels are pristine. If INTC is truly going to rebound off the support line like its done since 2011...then things are going to look pretty good over the next couple months. \n\n[Dammit... I drew the fib. ](https://preview.redd.it/81db3f696ux71.png?width=2870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37d239e93adcb3aca54f0a7d2fe9918d4a026174)\n\nPositions: Boomer style. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[It doesn't matter how little I have. One day I'll get this portfolio to Buick bliss. ](https://preview.redd.it/zr7j3ogp6ux71.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d58adb3eea547c604cc299f4b635fee32f2a4f6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: INTC long and strong like Donkey Kong.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nJust wanted to share some food for thought about a great company. \n\nThe current PE ratio of NVDA is above 100. Its median (as well as the mean) PE ratio over the past 10 years has been around 31 so it would be nothing but reasonable to think that it will eventually reverts to the mean over the next years.\nFor that to happen, either the share price takes a hit of 70% or the EPS grow to 10 and more.\nAssuming the first one will stay exactly where it currently is and that the company will manage to grow their EPS at around 32% over the next years, it would take 4,5 years for the PE ratio to revert to the mean: in a scenario where NVDA, a 792b market cap company, keeps growing like crazy, someone investing at the current price would get 0% returns for quite a bit of years.\n\nShort-term speculation aside, which may or may not play in favour of those investing at the current price, why would someone choose NVDA over other opportunities right now?",

        "selftext": "**BULL CASES**\n\n/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.\n\n/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.\n\n/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.\n\nFor reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).\n\n/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.\n\n/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.\n\n/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.\n\n/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.\n\n*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*\n\n/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.\n\n/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.\n\n/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.\n\n/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.\n\n/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?\n\n/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Bear Cases**\n\n/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.\n\n/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.\n\n/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.\n\n/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.\n\n/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.\n\n[positions or ban. bought 100 shares for now. will be selling some puts to enter into more. And then around the next earnings, will buy some calls](https://imgur.com/a/xxYyDIE)",

I was requested by a few users to write an $MU (Micron Technology) DD. \n\n**Company profile:**\n\n*\u201cThe world is moving to a new economic model, where data is driving value creation in ways we had not imagined just a few years ago. Data is today\u2019s new business currency, and memory and storage are strategic differentiators which will redefine how we extract value from data to expand the global economy and transform our society.*\n\n*As the leader in innovative memory solutions, Micron is helping the world make sense of data by delivering technology that is transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Through our global brands \u2014 Micron and Crucial \u2014 we offer the industry\u2019s broadest portfolio. We are the only company manufacturing today\u2019s major memory and storage technologies: DRAM, NAND, and NOR technology.*\n\n*By providing foundational capability for innovations like AI and 5G across data center, the intelligent edge, and consumer devices, we unlock innovation across industries including healthcare, automotive and communications. Our technology and expertise are central to maximizing value from cutting-edge computing applications and new business models which disrupt and advance the industry.*\n\n*From our roots in Boise, Idaho, Micron has grown into an influential global presence committed to being the best memory company in the world. This means conducting business with integrity, accountability, and professionalism and supporting our global community.\u201d*\n(https://www.micron.com/about/our-company/corporate-profile)\n\n**Introduction:**\n\n*Market Profile*:\n1 week:\nhttps://imgur.com/y6kbuoj\n2 week:\nhttps://imgur.com/z3s8VzH\n\n[MU 1D chart](https://imgur.com/ZVG0IKv)\n\n**Don't sell MU now, it outperformed most of it's peers**\n*\u201dMICRON TECHNOLOGY INC was among the best performers on Friday. It returned +7.8% to close at 83.03. On a day when the overall market breadth was 44%, it closed higher than 68% of the market. In comparison, the benchmark SP500 index closed today at -0.0014%.\u201d*\n\nThis is going to be a DD focused on the value of the products (Micron and Crucial memory, data center presence, and consumer use), as well as the value of the company.\n\nMicron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).\n\nMU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&amp;P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.\n\n*\u201cWe believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,\u201d wrote Muse.*\n\nMuse noted that WSt expectations for Micron\u2019s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron\u2019s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.\n\n*\u201cAnd once they do\u2014we think the stock action could be fast,\u201d Muse wrote. \u201cWe also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.\u201d*\n*Other reasons for the climb:*\n* Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a research note that recent channel checks show there has been increased demand for DRAM memory among PC makers, and that a pricing correction in the DRAM market is \u201cdrawing to a close\u201d.\n* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving \u201cdue to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google\u201d. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.\n* Earlier this week hedge fund Appaloosa Management said it recently sold off almost 3 million shares of MU, to leave the fund with 2.75 million shares.\n**Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron**\n\nMicron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU\u2019s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.  [The company is improving its 1-alpha DRAM](https://www.micron.com/1alpha-dram-technology) to compete with Samsung/SK Hynix.\nThe DRAM market is expected to grow over the long term, due to rising DRAM use in smartphones, PC\u2019s, consumer electronics, automotive and industrials. \n\n*Smartphones:* \n[Since 2016 the average DRAM capacity has risen from 2.4GB to 4.75GB (average of iOS and Android).](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartphones-dram-trends-2019-2020/) Micron has stated that 5G phones feature 50% more DRAM than 4G phones. It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PC\u2019s living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase. For example, think about how old iPhones struggle to run new versions of iOS, partially due to insufficient DRAM in older models. \n\n[Check this graph!](https://imgur.com/d9oI7WW)\n\n*Data Center:*\nDRAM is integral in servers, notably in data centre applications, it is rapidly evolving to support growing workloads for AI, big data and machine learning. Micron is working on DDR5 to support data center transitions to DDR5 platforms this year.\nData creation is projected to grow at a rate of around 23% in the next 5 years. This would require larger cloud infrastructure in order to handle this. Data centres are generally backed up by an SSD storage array, Micron remains committed to this through it\u2019s NVMe SSD portfolio, and is introducing PCIe 4.0 data centre SSDs. As demand for cloud storage rises, Micron could see increased demand for these products. \n\n*PC/Gaming:*\nFaster RAM leads to faster processing speeds. Intensive use of PCs such as gaming, video editing and streaming require better and more efficient RAM.\nFrom Statista, the chart below shows increasing PC DRAM memory density, with the share of memory &gt;[4GB increasing to 82% in 2020](https://imgur.com/w9w0xPq) \n(https://www.statista.com/statistics/781438/worldwide-computer-dram-shipment-market-share-by-density/)\n\n*Automotive DRAM:*\nAutomotive DRAM only accounts for 1.8% of the DRAM market currently. However, advances in automotive tech such as autonomous driving and vehicle connectivity will drive an increase in this. The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).\n\n*Industrials &amp; Consumer Electronics:*\nDRAM is used in systems/equipment in manufacturing processes. Industrial type DRAM is more focused on providing a stable solution for reliability. Automation and IoT (Internet of Things) is likely to increase demand for memory/increased memory. In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. \nAnother important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. \n\n**My Nvidia thesis:**\n\n**I worked as a qualified IT Hardware, Networking and Software Engineer for 5 or 6 years, and am now an Engineering student at college. I\u2019m a computer geek, especially for hardware. So I\u2019m going to enjoy writing this part. I hope my knowledge lends to it.**\n\n\nAlthough you won\u2019t find much correlation in the [charts](https://imgur.com/o3EaSAV), apart from the recent semi-boom. Nvidia and Micron are very strongly linked. \n\n\n*Increasing penetration of GPU\u2019s in data centres*\n\n\nRecently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU\u2019s. GPU\u2019s lend themselves perfectly towards [Machine Learning (ML-OLD) functions in data centres](https://www.eetimes.com/ai-chip-menu-expands-for-data-centers/).\n\nNow remember that GPU\u2019s are highly memory intensive. \nThis is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia\u2019s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released, [designed for AI in data centers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer).\n[You can also read more here.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)\n\n\u201cThe first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia\u2019s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, *40GB of memory*, and *1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth.\u201d* *There\u2019s also a version using 80GB!*\n\n\u201c*Smarter and Faster Memory*\nA100 brings massive amounts of compute to data centers. To keep those compute engines fully utilized, it has a class-leading 2 terabytes per second (TB/sec) of memory bandwidth, more than double the previous generation. In addition, A100 has significantly more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache\u20147X larger than the previous generation\u2014to maximize compute performance.*\u201d\n\nI cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100\u2019s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU\u2019s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron *does* manufacture the [HBM2E memory used in the A100](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/hbm2e#:~:text=HBM2E%20%7C%20Micron%20Technologies%2C%20Inc), hence I suspect Micron is one of their memory vendors for their data centre GPU\u2019s. \n\nI found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world\u2019s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU\u2019s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use [Micron NVME drives](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/pdf/dgxa100-service-manual.pdf).

Micron. \n*\u201cMicron has created the world\u2019s fastest discrete graphics memory solution, GDDR6X. GDDR6X was launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce\u00ae RTX\u2122 3090 and GeForce\u00ae RTX\u2122 3080 GPUs (including Ti) to take graphics beyond gaming into true AI. Watch to learn how Micron was able to achieve incredible speeds up to 1 TB/s system memory bandwidth.\u201c*\n\n[Read more here.](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/gddr6x)\n\n[Comparison between GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X](https://imgur.com/fl8FY68)\n\nThis means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU\u2019s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU\u2019s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well. \n\n**Overall I would conclude as long as Nvidia remains strong/bullish, you can be bullish on Micron as Nvidia are dependent on them for their products, particularly in the high-end.**\n\n\n**The AMD link**\n\nAlthough not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD [are using Micron GDDR6 memory in their RX6000 series graphics cards:](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-high-performance-gddr6-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6000)\n\n\u201cMicron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon\u2122 RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA\u2122 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron\u2019s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today\u2019s announcement continues Micron\u2019s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions.\n\n\u201cRadeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,\u201d said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. \u201cMicron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.\u201d\n\n**Is Micron a buy right now?**\n\nFor the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (\u2018mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases\u2019).\n\nMicron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of \u201cpotential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.\u201d\n\nMicron believes that \u201csecular growth drivers\u201d such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND. **I covered this in the \u2018Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron\u2019 section of my DD. Thus I think Micron is justified in this belief and spending plan.** Gill thinks it\u2019s a good move, and worries are overblown.\n\n*\u2018\u201cThe current spending plan,\u201d said the 5-star analyst, \u201cWhen annualized and put into context, is nothing out of the ordinary and should neither cause significant increases in industry capacity (so there should be no resulting price wars from the competition) nor be a significant drag on free cash flow, which would continue to grow and reach historical highs as a % of sales.\u201d\u2019*\n\nGill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a \u201chigh level of capital return flexibility,\u201d which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for \u201ccompetitive reasons,\u201d it will also provide a \u201csafety buffer\u201d for more R&amp;D or CapEx spending.\u201d\n\nGill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I\u2019ll add more recent figures in the following section). \n\n[\u201cThe 47 rating InvestorsObserver gives to Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) stock puts it near the middle of the Semiconductors industry. In addition to scoring higher than 38 percent of stocks in the Semiconductors industry, MU\u2019s 47 overall rating means the stock scores better than 47 percent of all stocks.\u201d](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/does-micron-technology-inc-mu-have-what-it-takes-to-be-in-your-portfolio-friday)\n\n[WSJ Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/fgGQbHV)\n[TipRanks Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/k85pW0e)\n[MarketBeat Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/6KStq0U)\n\n**Has Micron Run Its Cyclical Course?**\n\nI will be heavily sourcing from [this great and recent Nasdaq article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/has-micron-run-its-cyclical-course) for this section.\n\n\u2018On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron\u2019s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.\u2019\n\nThis fall is due to Micron\u2019s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. \u2018When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.\u2019\n\nThe company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. \n\n\u2018Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company\u2019s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.\u2019\n\nA June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, \u201cThe growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.\u201d\n\nMicron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. \u2018Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, \u201cSustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.\u2019 **Refer to my section about GDDR6X memory, Micron is delivering TOP quality.**\n\nInvestors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. \u2018The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.\u2019\n[Here is a useful article explaining the volatility of MU this past month.](https://investchronicle.com/2021/11/16/here-is-why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-volatility-recorded-over-the-last-month-was-2-30/)\n\n\u2018Tipranks\u2019 Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.\n\nThe average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.\u2019\n\u2018A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an \"overweight\" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an \"overweight\" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a \"buy\" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a \"hold\" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a \"buy\" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of \"Buy\" and an average target price of $103.31.\u2019\n\n**Upcoming Quarterly Sales/Next Earnings**\n\n[Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. \nOn average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. \nMicron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th. \u201c The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.\u201d\n**I could write way more for this DD.

Expecting us to pullback into a corrective wave 2 into a very buyable dip around $70. Be patient on this one, it's only getting started\u201d My gut says this guy is incorrect tbh, given the recent push. \n\n\n**[After 200 days we can see a breakout](https://imgur.com/Vmhx9Al) - Nov 12, very in-depth:**\n\u201cToday we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:\n\n1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse\n\n2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges\n\n3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.\n\n4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.\n\n5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)\n\n6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)\n\n7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.\n\n8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)\u201d\n\n\n**Tickeron AI TA, copied here so you don\u2019t have to sign up for an account.

I would advise to go for LEAPS and shares for this stock - either ITM or slightly OTM. If it becomes ITM, you can always roll to a higher strike if you wish.*\n\n*High-risk:*\nBe regarded and YOLO to play earnings on December 20th. I would suggest either buying ITM 80c or slightly OTM 85c for December 23 or December 31st. 90c if you like crayons. \n\n* [December 2021 options chain](https://imgur.com/QD3ROzy)\n\n*Medium risk:*\nBuy 80c, 82.5c, 85c for April, June, July or September. Or if you\u2019re regarded 87.50 and 90c.Play on the thesis that MU has a lot of value, will do well in December earnings (maybe), has great products, and that the downtrend is beginning to turn into an uptrend as I believe. I would suggest buying shares also. \n\n* [April 2022 options chain](https://imgur.com/YjV5c6i)\n\n* [June 2022 options chain](https://imgur.com/2kBPlPs)\n\n* [July 2022 options chain](https://imgur.com/PIj2Mz6)\n\n* [September 2022 options chain](https://imgur.com/wSJkFez)\n\n\n*Low(ish...they\u2019re still options) risk:*\nBuy 80c or 82.50c for Jan 2023, June 2023 or Jan 2024. Medium/low risk is 85c. Medium/low risk but still regarded is 90c.  Even better would be to buy warrant options. \n\n* [January 2023 options chain](https://imgur.com/mbsv9AF)\n\n* [June 2023 options chain](https://imgur.com/Pz0HOkU)\n\n* [January 2024 options chain](https://imgur.com/GSTkEPb)\n\nMedium/low risk:\nBuy 80c or 82.5c for 2022 and LEAPS for 2023/2024. Maybe warrants, if that is possible for you. Also buy shares. \n\n\n**Where should I enter? (options or shares):**\n\nLook out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds. \n\nTL;DR:\n\n* MU bounced on Friday, perhaps this is the sign that its downtrend is reversing.\n\n* Higher future DRAM demand will push up Micron. DRAM is used in Smartphones, Data centres, PC/Gaming, Automotive, Industrials and Consumer Electronics. Increased demand in these sectors will drive up Micron\u2019s value. \n\n* Nvidia uses Micron memory in it\u2019s data centre GPU\u2019s.\n\n* Nvidia\u2019s ONLY supplier of GDDR6X memory used in higher-end gaming GPU\u2019s is Micron. Nvidia is dependent on them for this high-performance memory.\n\n* AMD are using Micron GDDR6(not X) memory in their RX 6000 series GPU\u2019s.\n\n* Micron\u2019s downtrend has changed in November. \n\n* Micron intends to spend $150 billion combined on Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D.\n\n* $130 price target from Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.\n\n* Micron moves based on the supply/demand for memory.\n\n* Micron may have bottomed out now, and is due to go up.\n\n* \u2018Tipranks\u2019 Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.\nThe average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.\n\n* [Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. \n\n* On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. \nMicron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th. \u201c The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.\u201d\n\n\n**Are there any sections or points I'm missing?

        "selftext": "I've been reading a bunch of random posts online about different companies I'm currently interested in, and I realize I'm happy that I'm an investor and I always will be. \n\nI don't understand how people can exist with a trader mindset. It's seems like you need to study alot of quasi science, be on social media constantly, do alot of cocaine, and it really just seems stressful. \n\nThe neat thing about reddit is I can look and see when people post their \"analysis\" of a stock. Which for 99% of reddit, is just a trader saying voodoo witch craft nonsense about enter and exit points, resistance this and that, cutting losses, and special orders. \n\nThen you ask for their portfolio and they have none or its top secret or something. It's not illegal to share your portfolio you great traders. \n\nI'm an average Joe, and I'm not that smart. so I feel really good when I read posts from people who buy a stock like MU, three years ago, at 40-43 a share, and sell it saying they see no future in it. It's trading at like $83 now. \n\nI love it when I read people saying they bought Uber near ipo at 40 and sold at 32 and say it's doomed to fail. But Uber is still around, in fact it hit a height of $60 last spring and now it's $44. You haven't even given it a chance to grow or become something yet. Like the company is a verb, give it a few years. \n\nI think traders are like fake friends in high school. They're only around you if you're cool. Once you're not cool anymore they abandon you. But traders are onlu a small portion of money for a company a company makes stuff to sell to people and that's what really draws in revenue to grow. \n\nI see alot of people talk about the \"opportunity cost\" or \"oppurtuniy lost, \" something like that when you're not trading. Like if I buy something that isn't moving fast, or something is in the red, it's better to \"cut my losses.\" \n\nBut that's like... Buying high and selling low. \n\nThat sounds like the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather sink with my ship if you're telling me to always sell the moment my stock goes red. \n\nif I was so foolish as to pick a bad company, I'd rather just take the full loss, rather then death by a thousand cuts. \n\nBut I pick companies that make more revenue every year, have increasing dividends, and are medium to large size growth companies. \n\nI'm boring. \n\nI just look at the best performing companies, read their 10k and just invest. My first two companies I bought were Apple and Starbucks, I then bought Nvidia and Realty Income. I bought Pennymac and Weyerhaeuser afterward. I just sorta sit on them. I just hold them and buy more. If I somehow become broke instantly from these decisions then damn. \n\nI'm investing in known companies with easy business models. I like safety and simplicity. \n\nI don't believe I'm gonna become a multi millionaire with several cars and boats. I just want to make enough money to be the first millionaire in my family, and have my children live of my dividends so they don't have to work so hard. \n\nIt just seems like people don't have patience on the internet. And when you take the time to read people who argue about a particular stock, and then for those same people to be proven wrong by time. It feels good.",

        "selftext": "I hold no position of INTC long or short just a person who used to reverse engineer this stuff, and then worked in a datacenter for many years.  \n\nThere has been a noticeable amount of INTC posts but non of these delve into their technical shortfalls compared to their competitors AMD NVDA TSM ARM etc\n\nI wrote this many years ago https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nand the gap in technology is even bigger in AMD's favor.

        "selftext": "So every thread I read nowadays concerning stocks such as TSLA and NVDA essentially boil down to whether we can still use fundamentals (P/E) to value growth stocks such as these. \n\nMy argument is no, we can't. The reason is because we simply cannot estimate the future growth of these companies. We can only estimate growth based on what we know now. So for example we can look at profit margins on existing products and anticipate how the demand/margins on these products will change over time. The problem is over 10+ years a lot can happen, so many new ideas/revenue streams will emerge between then and now. Things we didn't think were possible become possible. Things we didn't even think of become the ordinary. \n\nLike who seriously would have predicted MSFT/GOOG/AAPL/FB current earnings to be this high 10 years ago? Nobody. Actually, a lot of people (including myself back in 2014) were saying these stocks had limited growth potential because their upgrades were minimal. I genuinely thought after the iPhone 6 that most people would not feel the need to upgrade their phone every other year. The iPhone 6 was a great phone. I certainly did not expect people to pay over 2x (3x?) the cost of the iPhone 6 for a minimal upgrade, but they did. People want the latest things. Who's to say Apple won't jack costs up to \u00a32.5k for a new phone over the next 10 years? Anybody who suggests this will be ridiculed and people will simply say 'consumers won't accept such a price hike and will choose lower priced alternatives'. \n\nThis is even more true for companies such as TSLA who will be developing so many new products over the next 10 years, how can we possibly assign a value to things we don't even know exist? Anybody who tried would come across like a madman. Imagine trying to put a value on cloud computing 10 years ago, people would've just laughed at you and called it wishful thinking. \n\nAt the heart of it, a lot of us are very analytical people. We don't like to bet on things we can't predict. We also don't like to be seen as sheep, betting on things that everybody else is betting on. We like to think we can go against the grain and find value elsewhere. Unfortunately we just have to accept that these big tech stocks will grow for reasons we can't predict. Get comfortable with that. \n\nThis is not to say that there won't be some sort of 'correction' (read: minor drop). I'm sure there will be corrections over the next 10 years, but waiting for a correction will cost you far more than the correction itself. \n\n*tldr; 'Time in the market beats market timing'.*",

        "selftext": "From Wikipedia:\n\n\"ViacomCBS Inc. is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate corporation formed through the merger of the second incarnation of CBS Corporation and the second incarnation of Viacom on December 4, 2019[4] (which were split from the original incarnation of Viacom in 2006) and headquartered at the One Astor Plaza complex in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, United States. The company operates over 170 networks and reaches approximately 700 million subscribers in approximately 180 countries, as of 2019\"\n\nViacom is currently trading at just 6.46x earnings, making it one of the cheapest stocks relative to earnings in the S&amp;P500. Of course, many may express concern that with the downfall of Cable, ViacomCBS may end up like Blockbuster.\n\nFortunately, ViacomCBS's execs are aware of this risk, and have diversified into streaming services. [ViacomCBS has seen significant growth in subscriber numbers on their streaming platforms over the past year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1047393/cbs-all-access-subscribers-us/)\n\nViacom has a tremendous amount of intellectual property in the shows and movies it owns. Its pivot into streaming services enables it to continue to leverage its vast content to produce earnings.\n\nWith its rapid growth with streaming, the stock is extremely cheap compared to competitors such as Disney and Netflix.\n\n**Why is the stock so cheap?**\n\n1. Their balance sheet shows a significant amount of liabilities. These liabilities present a risk if the company's revenue continues to decline.[Fortunately, ViacomCBS has been using their earnings to redeem senior notes to address this risk](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210226005656/en/ViacomCBS-Announces-Redemption-of-Approximately-2.0-Billion-of-Senior-Notes). As interest expenses decrease from paying off debt, this should enable them to grow earnings without needing to grow revenue.\n\n2. Investors are scared the stock will go down. ViacomCBS' stock price is down 45% over the past 5 years. When compared to the S&amp;P doubling during that time frame, it feels like a bad stock to own. Currently, investors are piling in to big winners such as Nvidia, Tesla, etc. Solid companies at great prices just aren't on investors radar right now.\n\nJust because the stock is down does not mean the company is doing worse, though. Viacom's Earnings Per Share is higher now than it was 5 years ago, yet the price is down nearly 50%. The stock went from a P/E of 15 to about 6-7 over the past 5 years. In other words, investors are paying substantially less for the same earnings.\n\n3. The fallout of Archegos Capital management earlier this year resulted in a lot of shares hitting the market very quickly.\n\nWhat's worth considering is with any value play, it can take a very long time before the market corrects itself. Don't buy in expecting to make a quick buck. The stock can absolutely still go down even on good news if investors fear the stock.\n\nOther than the dividend yielding about 2.9%, it is likely ViacomCBS will use their earnings for both paying down debt, and investing in streaming. \n\nDisclaimer: I currently own 100 shares of VIAC and intend to buy more if it drops further. Target valuation of $55.",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation AND Analysis (Q3 Week 6) - $NVDA, $WMT, $HD, $LOW, $BABA, $SE, $M, and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, hope you all managed to escape meme week with your portfolios intact! The name of the game this week is Retails Giants and Chinese Tech, and it\u2019s here where we\u2019ll find some of our most lucrative opportunities. Although it may not seem like it, some of the companies in these sectors have extremely large historical moves, meaning we\u2019ve got the potential to make some serious dough. We\u2019re also approaching holiday season, meaning that many retailers will give adjusted guidance on their calls in light of the supply chain issues that have been plaguing the globe, adding to the intensity of these already large moves. Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **The premiums on $NNOX are intoxicating.** Options are pricing around a 17% move at the time of writing, but historically $NNOX only moves 9%. Unfortunately for us, the sample size on this company is small, so we need to tread a little more carefully than usual. Regardless, the most $NNOX has ever moved post earnings is 18%, meaning even if we do get a \u201cmaximum\u201d move, we won\u2019t lose much money. I will likely opt to sell a 20/28 strangle once I conduct all little more research into the company later this week. I want to see if I can uncover any reasons regarding ***why*** the premiums are so high.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$FL options will be extremely cheap come Friday.** Currently, the options are pricing an 8.3% move relative to the historical move of 9.3% , making them relatively efficient. Given that volatility doesn\u2019t inflate throughout the week, these options should become extremely cheap by Friday since theta will murder the extrinsic value on them. Footlocker is no stranger to large moves, and if we can enter a lotto strangle for cheap Thursday before close, we could be looking at a handsome return come Friday morning. A straddle will currently run you $460, but by Friday this number may be closer to $300. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll roll the dice on this one - I like my odds.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Chinese tech give us an awesome collateral play opportunity!** $KW\u00a3B is a high liquidity ETF consisting of all of the Chinese tech stocks who report this week. If it behaves anything like American tech does during earnings week, there should be a clear directional move in the entire ETF. If we\u2019re bullish or bearish on Chinese tech as a whole, we should look to go long or short on $KW\u00a3B instead of any of the individual tickers in order to mitigate our risks and generate significantly greater profits. For more information on this type of play, check out my in-depth writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If you don\u2019t see any appealing trades, use [collateral plays](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) to dynamically alter your risk profile for a larger potential payout! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading!**",

        "selftext": "**BULL CASES**\n\n/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.\n\n/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.\n\n/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.\n\nFor reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).\n\n/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.\n\n/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.\n\n/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.\n\n/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming in both power consumption and power. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops.

Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*\n\n/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.\n\n/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.\n\n/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.\n\n/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.\n\n/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?\n\n/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Bear Cases**\n\n/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR by management's conservative estimates.\n\n/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are unreliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.\n\n/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.\n\n/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.\n\n/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 16, 2021**\n\nStocks gained today, with market participants releasing a sigh of relief as new economic data showed consumer demand remains strong despite ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages. Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), and Home Depot (HD) are set to release quarterly earnings this week, giving us more information into the state of consumer spending in the US. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.\n\nThe Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers\n\n* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected\n* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%\n* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%\n\nThe solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. \n\nMatthew Shay, President of the National Retail Federation, said of the report, \u201cToday\u2019s numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping. We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, two of the largest retailers in the US, Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD), reported earnings today, with both companies demolishing earnings (though WMT stock did not react positively). Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Walmart (WMT)** \n   * Revenue: $140.53 billion vs $135.60 billion expected \n   * Earnings per Share (EPS): $1.45 vs $1.40 expected\n   * Sames Store Sales: +9.2% vs +6.9% expected \n   * eCommerce Sales: +8% vs +1.9% expected \n* **Home Depot (HD)**\n   * Revenue: $36.82 billion vs $35.01 billion expected\n   * Earnings per Share (EPS): $3.92 vs $3.40 expected\n   * Same Store Sales: +6.1% vs 1.9% expected\n\nThese reports came at the tail end of what has already been an exceptionally strong earnings season. As of Friday, 92% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results, and of these, 81% of them had reported better-than-expected earnings results, according to FactSet.\n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_111221.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_111221.pdf)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Somehow, someway, shares of Rivian (RIVN) keep rising after its blockbuster IPO, with the company now being the third largest auto manufacturer by market cap at roughly $150 billion despite barely completing any deliveries. This is, by far, the craziest valuation I\u2019ve ever seen. \n* The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that import prices rose 1.2% on a monthly basis in October, coming in well above the 0.4% rise for September. This was also above the 1.0% increase consensus economists expected for October, according to Bloomberg data.\n* Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are on fire after the company projected that its chipset business will average \u201cmidteens\u201d revenue growth through its fiscal year 2024. That\u2019s well above the 8% average contemplated by Wall Street\u2019s current estimates.\n* Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the highly anticipated sequel to Tiger King tomorrow. It seems like Netflix has been on an amazing roll as of late and now has a higher market cap than Disney (DIS)\n* Lucid Motors (LCID) has now overtaken Ford Motors (F) in market cap\n* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly working to make its own in-house modem chip that allows wireless connection for iPhones by 2023. Qualcomm (QCOM), which currently supplies modem chips for all Apple devices, estimates Apple will self-supply 80% of modem chips by 2023. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with four target raises. Stock currently around $235\n   * Citigroup from $282 to $290 at Buy\n   * Wedbush from $250 to $270 at Outperform\n   * Credit Suisse from $250 to $255 at Outperform\n   * Bank of America from $256 to $282 at Buy\n* Datadog (DDOG) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $210 to $230 at Buy.

        "selftext": "S&amp;P 500 forward price to earnings ratios are at the highest they've been since the tech bubble. This may lead to the question- are we in a bubble?\n\nOne way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities.\n\nHistorically, the S&amp;P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate.\n\nhttps://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf\n\nThis hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&amp;P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield.\n\nContrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&amp;P500 earnings yield prior to the crash.\n\n\n\nThe other risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices.\n\nFortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, \"Value\" stocks usually outperform \"growth\" stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. \n\nBecause interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%,  future earnings are worth very close to present earnings.\n\nWith a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings!\n\nOn the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own \"Dinosaur\" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. \n\nWhen interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do.\n\nOf course, stocks always carry market risk. A recession can drive a crash due to lower earnings, as it did in 2009, and in 2020. If you are investing for the short term, it may be smart to avoid having too much in equities.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. For those that don\u2019t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone! \n\nDuring the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they\u2019re doing which I\u2019m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.\n\nNow let's talk about their evaluation\u2026\n\n1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia\u2019s multiples are leading more than any other company. \n2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants \u201cEvery transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU\u201d While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU\u2019s. \n3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It\u2019s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia\u2019s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company. \n\nI hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!\n\n**EBITDA**, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization,",

It\u2019s gone up about 1000% in 4 years and now my NVDA holdings represent about 40% of the total of my IRA. \n\nMy thesis hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cThe internet of things\u201d will continue to be a secular tailwind but I realize it\u2019s risky to have so much invested in one company.  There isn\u2019t anything I currently see as a better investment so if I sold I\u2019d be increasing my cash position to wait for some deals. How important is diversification to you?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 22, 2021**\n\nAfter trading mostly even throughout the day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) sold off sharply in the last hour. Early in the morning, President Biden announced this morning that Jerome Powell was renominated to lead the Federal Reserve for another four years. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who was Powell\u2019s main competitor, was nominated as the Vice-Chair. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for more inflation data set to be released later this week. \n\nOn Monday, President Biden announced he was nominating Jerome Powell for a second, four-year term as the Chair of the Federal Reserve and Fed Governor Lael Brainard as the Vice-Chair, ending weeks of speculation who would be tapped to run the nation\u2019s Central Bank. Biden was expected to select either Powell or current Fed Governor Lael Brainard as Fed chair. Following the nomination, Powell will go before the Senate Banking Committee for approval, and if confirmed, will serve another four-year term. \n\nEric Browne, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Pimco, said \u201cI think this was largely expected by markets. Certainly there were some conversations in markets over the last couple of weeks about Brainard potentially being elevated to the Fed chair position. But by and large the expectation was for consistency. You may see a little bit of a rally on the back of this with the expectation that policy is going to remain in place and intact, and everything that\u2019s been articulated already by the Fed is likely to continue into 2022 and beyond.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, more inflation data is set to be released later this week, which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation and any potential reactions by the Federal Reserve. The Core Personal Consumptions Expenditure (PCE) , which is Fed\u2019s preferred measure for inflation, is set to be released Wednesday and expected to show a 4.1% year-over-year increase. This would be the biggest annual jump in roughly three decades. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Constellation Brands (STZ), the maker of Corona beer, is reportedly exploring for a deal to merge with Monster Beverage, according to a report by Bloomberg\n* Private Equity Firm KKR made a $12 billion bid to bring Telecom Italia private, sending shares of the Italian telecommunication company higher.\n* Sales of previously owned homes in the US unexpectedly jumped to their highest level in nine months in October, signaling that housing demand is picking up against a backdrop of low mortgage rates and strengthening labor markets. Existing home sales rose by 0.8% month-over-month in October, reaching an annualized rate of 6.34 million, according to data from the National Association of Realtors\n* General Motors (GM) bought a 25% stake in electric boat startup Pure Watercraft for $150 million. \n* Netflix (NFLX) said it is acquiring special effects company Scanline VFX, which is behind the effects of \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d. \n* Tesla Inc is planning to spend more than $1 billion on its new vehicle factory in Austin, Texas, and plans to complete construction by the end of this year, public filings with a Texas state agency showed.\n* NVIDIA (NVDA) [today detailed an AI system called GauGAN2,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-absurd-beauty-of-hacking-nvidias-gaugan-2-ai-image-machine/) the successor to its GauGAN model, that lets users create lifelike landscape images that don\u2019t exist using text. The program was developed by feeding 10 million high quality images into NVIDIA\u2019s Selene supercomputer. This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist's vision into a high-quality AI-generated image. The practical benefi is that one can use a few words to get a basic image together without any drawing at all and then tweak details to refine the final output. \n* In other news, NVIDIA is fast tracking development of its \u201c[Zero-Trust\u201d cybersecurity platform built using their data processing units and Morpheus AI](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/22/how-nvidia-aims-to-demystify-zero-trust-security/), citing vulnerabilities in it\u2019s clients' datacenters. Very basically, traditional cybersecurity relies on a perimeter or firewall that prevents viruses and hacks from getting into your computer. Zero-trust is an architecture that also constantly monitors all the data in the system and is able to enforce strict control on what each user can do on the network. Manuvir Das, Head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA said, \u201cYou cannot just rely on the firewall on the outside, you have to assume that any application or any user inside your data center is a bad actor,\u201d and \u201cIt is not our intention to be a direct provider of cybersecurity solutions. We have built the platform for cybersecurity companies to integrate into their solutions.\u201d",

        "selftext": "**Summary**\n\nTechnical analysis indicates that now is an excellent time to buy into HIMX. As shown in the chart below, HIMX is breaking out of a four-month long decline and buying now allows an entry point that comes with low downside risk. Moreover, this break-out is occurring in November, exactly one year from the break-out that occurred last November.  Comparing the two break-outs suggests that strong gains lie ahead for HIMX.\n\n**$10 Support Held**\n\nHIMX has a support at $10 that has been tested multiple times this year (see chart). This support first started as a resistance (point 1), which then switched to a support that was subsequently tested six times (points 2-7). In general, the more a support is tested and holds, the stronger it gets. For example, at point 6, the support was breached and HIMX closed below $10. However, the very next trading session HIMX recovered and closed above $10. In subsequent trading sessions the $10  support was tested but not breached (point 7). If a support is breached, but subsequent trading sessions fail to confirm this breach, the support is considered to have held.  The chart shows that the $10 support has held pretty much throughout 2021.\n\n**Downward Channel Broken**\n\nHIMX has been in a downward channel since July 1, forming a descending flag  pattern. However, HIMX broke out of this pattern between Oct. 28 - Nov. 1, which is right where the upper channel line intersects the $10 support. A break-out at this location is not coincidental and very bullish for HIMX, especially given the strong post-earnings follow-through on Nov. 5. In fact, this break-out mirrors the start of the break-out that happened back in November 2020. Again, very bullish.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter months of decreasing prices, HIMX has formed a reversal that is turning into a strong break-out. This break-out will especially accelerate if the bears capitulate and close out their short positions. (As of October 15, the short interest is 24,652,040 shares or 14.1% of the public float.) I have already posted about the lure of HIMX\u2019s FY-2021 dividend, which will most likely be above $1.92 per share and correspond to a 16+% forward yield. But there is one other thing to consider.  (Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMX/comments/qns9ow/if_you_are_interested_in_himx_now_is_the_time_to/) to read post on dividends.)\n\nThe  market is heading into December, a time in which many investors and institutions re-balance their stock portfolios for the next year. Such re-balancing includes investors and institutions reducing their exposure to stocks that performed well but have become overextended.  The resulting profits are rotated into undervalued names. HIMX is deeply undervalued relative to virtually all other semiconductor stocks. For example, AMD and NVDA have forward PE ratios of 41.04 and 63.74,  respectively, while HIMX has a forward PE ratio of about 4.7. As such, HIMX is going to garner a lot of buying interest in December due to its ridiculously low PE, strong projected 2022 revenues, expanding 2022 margins, and mind-boggling 16+% forward yield.\n\nThe bottom line here is to get in early before HIMX really starts to move.  If Friday\u2019s (Nov. 5) price action is any indication, investors liked  what management had to say during their earnings call (Nov. 4) and more will buy into HIMX as the word starts to spread. The technical analysis shown in the chart below indicates that now is an excellent entry point in HIMX and comes with low downside risk.",

        "selftext": "I got approved for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card 4 months ago and received the 100k points in rewards after the $4k spent in 4 months. I received the points 2-3 months ago. I haven't used the points for anything and currently have 109,314 points in chase rewards. This equals $1,093.14 if redeemed for statement credit or deposited into a bank account. If redeemed this amount through Chase Ultimate Rewards for travel for the 1.25X points value this increases the value to $1,366.42.\n\nI was planning on saving these points for a vacation or travel that is not a vacation. I've been thinking the last couple of weeks that it would make more sense for me to move the points value to an investment account, but haven't done it yet because I still have been contemplating using these points for travel since it's 25% more value. A couple of days ago I decided I will move this money into an investment account unless someone can give me a reason not to.. If I moved this money to an investment account back in roughly August or September into VTI I could be up approximately 7-8% already. If invested in NVDA (been investing in a brokerage for NVDA so I picked that for this) I could have been up \\~55% to \\~$1,694.\n\nI am 26 and the future is more important than now so it would make more sense to invest it.. I haven't done the math until writing this post, for that I realize I am answering my own post in that it makes more sense to invest this money than to redeem it for travel. I am not trying to break rule #2, I am just trying to get advice on what thoughts are for investing it vs using the points, if I break #2 sorry. \n\nNot stating my personal situation, I am just asking if others have done this before and what seems to be better. I am going to deposit my chase credit card bonus points/money equivalent into my Roth IRA or HSA unless someone has advice on that it would be better enjoyment-wise to use it for vacation or travel in the short term..",

Basically I was looking to build a snapshot of each company. The POS. column is a result of compiling the options contracts ending the week with the highest open interest. My actual position is to the far left. $SPREAD indicates the range between the current price and the strike price of the contract. NET/GROSS is for the last reported yearly financials. All data was pulled from either Yahoo or Nasdaq. Numbers are accurate-ish. I have no background in finance, so Im expecting to learn from this. Would definitely appreciate feedback from those who know what they're doing. I understand IV crush limits or extinguishes profits on contracts held through earnings, so Im taking positions that I think will have meaningful price movement. Green on the row means I have calls, and red puts.\n\nQFIN: this company has a low and positive P/E and lower estimate for the next year. They beat earnings last quarter by 25.42% and a profit margin of 25.78%. A price point of 26.04 is affordable they're involved in data so Im giving it a go.\n\nMVST: there's a lot better DD on this site than this, but overall it looks like they're going to start growing into positive earnings, and if contracts with USPS come through, it'll be a great play. beat earnings last quarter by 91%. The options with the highest open interest are puts, but I see a great upside here.\n\nDAVA: This company has a high P/E but they beat earnings and have a profit margin of 28.24%. The options with leading OI are already ITM.\n\nSTNE: Looks solid across the board. Affordable. crushed EPS last quarter. good profit margin.\n\nSBLK: Affordable. Super low P/E estimate. Maybe moving into big earnings. Still positive profit margin. Might do a late DOE on this.\n\nDLO: affordable: PM is huge. Big upside on the favored strike price.\n\nWPC: a little pricey. Looks like a solid company overall.\n\nTGT: Huge upside for puts. The spread makes me think people know something I don't. 83% of open interest is for puts here. Would really like to hear someones opinion on this.\n\nLOW: Same as TGT. huge spread of the strike price. Less percentage overall for puts. A lot of analysts are saying its over weight. Maybe they'll have dog shit earnings?\n\nZIM: this seems like the star of the show. The financials are solid. Super low P/E estimate. nice spread on strike price. Insane profit margin. Big time go.\n\nNVDA: everyones buying this anyway.\n\nYY: no position here yet. Just curious how they have a negative operating cost that puts NET above Gross.\n\nPlease let me know if Im a total smooth brain retard or what. Thanks!",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 4, 2021**\n\nThe good times keep on rolling! The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the \u201csubstantial progress\u201d benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.\n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nSpecifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on \"changes in the economic outlook.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. \n\nNew weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion. This is the next $1 trillion stock IMO. The surge happened due to Wells Fargo raising price target $330, citing the metaverse as a major growth contributor\n* According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) are working out how quickly the rental car company can receive its 100,000 cars delivered\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5\\&amp;amp;reflink=article\\_copyURL\\_share](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share)\n\n* Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for \"green\" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.\n* Britain could speed up a move to make the executives of big techs firm criminally liable for harmful content on their platforms if they do not take action to tackle the problem, Digital Minister Nadine Dorries told lawmakers on Thursday.\n* Google is pursuing a massive cloud-computing contract with the Department of Defense, nearly three years after abandoning a similar bid process in the face of employee protests.\n* Google said on Thursday it plans to allow third party payment systems in South Korea in order to comply with a new law that bans major app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Oppenheimer from $296 to $307 at Outperform.

The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**\n\nThe market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming. A Netflix subscription is required but there is no additional cost. \n* Elon Musk clarified via Twitter (TWTR) that there was no contract signed yet between Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) to buy the 100,000 EVs.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**\n\nThe market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming. A Netflix subscription is required but there is no additional cost. \n* Elon Musk clarified via Twitter (TWTR) that there was no contract signed yet between Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) to buy the 100,000 EVs. A Hertz spokeswoman said deliveries of Tesla had already started. A link on Hertz\u2019s website gives users the option to rent a Tesla Model 3. However, Hertz declines to comment beyond its original statement saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss the details of our business relationships or discussions with any auto maker or partner\u201d.\n* With the recent surge in Tesla, Elon Musk became the first person to have a personal net worth surpassing $300 billion, absolutely insane. If he were a company, he\u2019d be a top 30 company in the US by market cap by himself.\n* Green Bay Quarterback Aaron Rodgers teamed up with Square (SQ) to give away $1 million in BTC as part of a promotion and will begin receiving part of his massive $33.5 million salary in that currency. \n* Amazon (AMZN) seeks approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch two Project Kuiper satellites in 2022. Similar to SpaceX, it intends to be a broad constellation of internet and broadband satellites.\n* EV startup Rivian which is backed by Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motors (F) announced it was seeking a $53 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Akamai Technology target raised by Morgan Stanley from $119 to $130.
