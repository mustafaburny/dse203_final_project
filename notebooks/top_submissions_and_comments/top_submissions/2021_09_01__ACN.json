        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 10, 2021**\n\nStocks extended their streak of underperformance, with the three major indexes falling once again for the fifth consecutive day of losses, one of the worst weeks for equities all year. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.78% down, closing out the week 1.57% down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also closed the day 0.78% down, closing the week out 1.3%. The Dow Jones (DIA), which primarily weights financial, industrial, and energy stocks, closed the day 0.75%, closing the week 1.91% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its roughly year-long streak of underperformance, falling 0.97% and closing the week 2.53% lower. All year, IWM has been trading between a range of $210 and $235, unable to break out, compared to the more than 15% year-to-date gain by the SPY. Market participants remain concerned with the surge in the coronavirus Delta variant and the potential negative impact it could cause the economy.\n\nFirst off, in geopolitical news, President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in months. Afterward, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was considering investigating Chinese subsidies and their effect on the US economy. Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said \u201cThe Sino-America relationship is in disrepair and today\u2019s call does not seem to change this. The US appears to list actions it wants China to take, while China\u2019s demands seem minimalist, quit demonizing it and respect its red lines. Yet its red lines strike at the very heart of international order, such as its claims on most of the South China Sea and its aggressive provocative actions in the region.\u201d This also comes amid extremely intense regulatory pressures by the CCP on Chinese tech stocks, many of which have an American listing.\n\nIn other news, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. \n\nMike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, \u201cAnyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this won\u2019t be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind we\u2019re still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.\u201d\n\nNow, this is absolutely massive news and will have huge consequences in the market moving forward, especially for companies who derive a large percentage of their revenue through the Apple Store. Today,  a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apple\u2019s 15-30% commission. Stocks like Roblox (RBLX), Bumble (BMBL), Zynga (ZNGA), and Spotify (SPOT) sharply gapped up after the announcement. I cannot stress how big this is, in 2020 Apple made $73 billion in revenue from the commission on App purchases.\n\nUnfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. \n\nThis weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Peloton (PTON) shares gapped up after the company announced it was launching an apparel brand. It\u2019s probably gonna be the same sort of clothes that are sold in Lululemon (LULU).\n* The crackdown in China continues\u2026 This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were \u201curged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.\n* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflare\u2019s was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.\n* The Italian Data Authority asks Facebook (FB) to provide clarifications on the use and function of the smart glasses to gauge whether the product is compliant with privacy laws. Like I said yesterday, I think the glasses are a bad product, don\u2019t see any use for them apart from very niche uses, like live-streaming. Not even to mention FB\u2019s absolutely appalling record when it comes to data privacy (remember Cambridge Analytica?)\n* Sales of cars in China fell for the fourth straight month amid the global shortage in semiconductors that have forced automakers across the globe to slash production.\n* Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla employees asking them to \u201cgo super hardcore\u201d to make up for production challenges to \u201censure a decent Q3 delivery number.\u201d The CEO also said, \u201cThis is the biggest wave in Tesla history, but we got to get it done.\u201d I hope they get it done, still waiting on my Model 3 :(\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with two target raises.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 16, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed in a volatile session after getting a boost following the release of new economic data that showed retail sales for the month of August coming in stronger-than-expected, suggesting that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, held up despite rising coronavirus Delta variant concerns. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day with a gain of 0.07% and 0.08% respectively. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 0.17% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.17% and 0.19% down respectively. Jobless claims also came in near a pandemic-era low. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China\u2019s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nIn a new weekly report by Factset, consensus analysts are still looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of nearly 28% for the third quarter. While a deceleration from the more than 80% growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year, that would still mark the third-highest year-over-year increase in earnings for the index since 2010. Third-quarter earnings reporting season is set to pick up next month. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* A host of news coming out of Facebook (FB) after journalists reviewed internal documents from the company. Not going to get into it here, but I recommend you check out was is going on surrounding Facebook.\n* Ford Motors (F) said it plans to boost capacity from the F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 80,000 per year thanks to strong demand, adding that the vehicle would be for sale next spring.\n* Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who has built the company into the US\u2019 most valuable chip maker, was named as one of Time Magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People. I have said this publicly multiple times, but NVDA is my single favorite stock in the entire market.\n* Lucid\u2019s (LCID) luxury sedan has received a government certification for a range of 520 miles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it\u2019s the longest range EV rated so far. For comparisons, Tesla\u2019s Model S was rated for a range of 405 miles, though it is a lot cheaper. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which operates popular dating app Tinder, said it was working on its own payment system to circumvent Apple and Google following the recent decision by US authorities to allow companies to offer third-party payment solutions within the Google and Apple app stores. \n* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) said it aims for net-zero emissions within the next 30 years. \n* Popular chatting platform Discord raised $500 million in a new founding round, bringing the value of the company to an estimated $15 billion.

        "selftext": " If you\u2019re looking for a deSpac, gamma squeeze, short squeeze, ketchup squeeze, or memelord stock, this isn\u2019t it. So we will see if the mods even allow this.   \nI thought to myself the other day about \u201capex\u201d companies. These are the companies that are far and away the leading companies in their space. For example:  \nSocial Media: Facebook  \nOnline Shopping (and cloud..): Amazon  \nSearch: Google  \nSmartphones: Apple  \nEV cars: Tesla  \n\n\nYou get the idea. But what I was moderately surprised at was the **lack of social media** **marketing** company. When a company is scheduling things to advertise on Instagram, responding to your whining on Twitter, or answering customer queries via Whatsapp, what are they using? **If you\u2019re a top company, they\u2019re using Sprinklr.** \n\nGo look for yourself. What\u2019s Amazon\u2019s Twitter using? What\u2019s Google\u2019s Twitter using? What\u2019s ESPN (Disney) using?  \nOther examples of companies that use Sprinklr (as of Q2):  \nNetflix  \nMicrosoft  \nTwitter  \nAmazon\n\nGoogle  \nThe Marines (yep, it\u2019s been government-certified)  \nTSA  \nAccenture\n\nDeloitte  \nMcDonalds (tendies)  \nIf you work at a big company, you\u2019ll recognize there are a lot of disparate tools being used in a similar function. Social Media management is no different. At its simplest, Sprinklr allows companies to organize content across platforms, easily respond to customers through different channels, and analyze the outcomes. This is exceedingly valuable to companies in order to manage their social media (helping with marketing efficiency, customer service outcomes, social listening, etc.) There are also much deeper integrations here as well, but we will start with that.  \nNow, how much do you think a company would be worth, given that the majority of the Fortune 100 uses their services? What if I told you they had 74+ customers generating over $1M each on a yearly basis? What if I said they had about 1000 other customers, with average subscription revenue (yearly) of $350K each?  \nWell, whatever you had in your head - the current market cap of Sprinklr is roughly $4.3BN. By EoY, they\u2019re expecting (their prediction from Q2 earnings) to generate \\~$415M in revenue (22% growth YoY).   \nHowever, I believe it\u2019s generally undervalued for a variety of reasons.  \n1) They are recognizing revenue from subscriptions (90% of their revenue) as it happens, not when the deals are signed. I believe their estimates to be really low. Consider that there are 74 customers with at least $1M in yearly subscription revenue, and they themselves have stated they have 1000 customers with an average yearly value of $350K (as of June 23). Well, if you just took the average value X 1000 customers, + $74M, you\u2019re already at $424M revenue. And no doubt, there are more customers signed since June, and no doubt some of the 74 \u201cbig\u201d customers are spending much more than $1M annually. They also have the opportunity to upsell their current customers. **TL;DR** they\u2019re clearly going to be way ahead of their projected earnings and will continually revise earnings skyward.  \n2) This is a really sticky industry. The companies that put the amount of work to migrate to use Sprinklr aren\u2019t going to change to a different provider easily (and frankly, a single competitor doesn\u2019t really exist). Retention is likely to be extremely high.  \n3) Sprinklr is **really early**. The fact that they have the majority of the biggest companies on the planet signed bodes well for their future. They have now stated they\u2019re targeting the next biggest 30000 companies, and their sales pipeline/staff has started to ramp up (paused all of last year). I would expect many more companies to be signed here; additionally, I expect additional products to be released that can be upsold to existing customers (live chat analysis, liter-research platforms - they just announced something like this called Modern Research Lite - etc.)\n\nAnyway, I could say a lot more, but by this point I either have your interest or not. A few things to conclude with - \n\n1. Look at companies in an adjacent space to them. Qualtrics (survey + experience management company) - $23BN. Zendesk (mainly customer support/comms) - $14.5BN. Liveperson (a stock that literally just does chat on a website) - $4.7BN. Take any comp you want - probably undervalued.\n2. Sprinklr does have a competitor called **Sprout Social**. Sprout is awesome too, and much more targeted at small companies. I\u2019m invested in Sprout as well; they\u2019ve been on a rocketship recently ($7.3BN cap with $132M in yearly rev). However, I like Sprinklr over Sprout for a variety of reasons.. But the main one? **Trust what the top companies on Earth are using**. And I will take their judgment on this one. There\u2019s probably room for both to succeed, but Sprout is much more narrow in my mind.\n3. All wall street analyst PTs are above current price, with the lowest at $21 and the highest at $29.\n4. There is basically **zero** ETF ownership of this, which is absurd as Sprout has **60** ETFS that contain it. I would be shocked if ETFs didn\u2019t start picking this up, which will likely lead to a quick upswing in price because the amount of outstanding shares is quite low (high amount of institutional shares held, but can\u2019t be sold).\n   1. This has led to volatility recently (5-7% up and down days), but it doesn\u2019t seem to be reflected in options pricing as IV is \\~60-70%. Options not a bad idea.  \n\n\nTL;DR Sprinklr is undervalued. Massive opportunity. I think it could be the \u201cSalesforce of Social Media Management\u201d. Position = 2600 shares and 38 Feb 20 calls.   \n\n\nFortune 100 stat: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210907005026/en/Sprinklr-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210907005026/en/Sprinklr-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conference)   \nCompanies used (1): [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/09/17/sprinklr-inc-cxm-q2-2022-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/09/17/sprinklr-inc-cxm-q2-2022-earnings-call-transcript/)   \nCompanies used (2):  \n[https://www.sprinklr.com/stories/](https://www.sprinklr.com/stories/) \n\nMarket cap: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CXM?p=CXM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CXM?p=CXM)  \nInvestor deck: [https://investors.sprinklr.com/](https://investors.sprinklr.com/)",

The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps outperformed, closing the day 1.48% higher. Market participants continue to digest the evolving situations in China and a bevy of news coming out of Congress. \n\nThe Evergrande situation has been covered in detail in previous recaps, but there are a few updates. The company announced it was canceling plans to issue shares of its electric vehicle unit on the Shanghai stock exchange and its wealth management arm is facing an inquiry by the local government. \n\nIn other news, a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country\u2019s electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nhttps://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904\n\nThere are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. \n\nPublicly traded companies, including suppliers for Apple (AAPL) and one to Tesla (TSLA), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) issued statements on Sunday night warning that their factories were among those affected. Apple had no immediate comment, while Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/china-power-outages-pose-new-threat-to-supplies-of-chips-and-other-goods-11632769617\n\nIn the US, Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. \n\nCongress is set to vote tonight on a bill that would extend government funding through December while also raising or suspending the debt limit until the end of next year to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt, which would be disastrous. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would oppose raising the debt ceiling. \n\nMcConnell said he would support a clean stop-gap bill in order to avoid a government shutdown said he \u201cwill not provide Republican votes for raising the debt limit.\u201d Wednesday of last week, however, McConnell said, \u201cAmerica must never default -- we never have and we never will\u201d, as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase. \n\nDavid Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note this morning, \u201cSpeaker Pelosi and Senate Schumer announced that they will move forward with legislation that ties an extension of government spending authority to a suspension of the debt limit. Our political economist believes that the likelihood of a government shutdown increases the longer Democrats pursue this course. However, we find no major consistent reaction of the S&amp;P 500 to government shutdowns since 1980.\u201d\n\nHere is a very informative article by the Associated Press: [https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c](https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said yesterday the chamber would vote Thursday on the bipartisan infrastructure deal, which the Senate passed last month. This would be the same day that lawmakers need to come to an agreement to fund the government to avoid a partial shutdown, which would take place Friday at 12:01 a.m. ET if nothing is done. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Along with the news of power constraints in China, analysts at JP Morgan raised estimates for how long it will take customers to get the new iPhone 13, saying it will likely take more than four weeks for the pro models and 2 weeks for the base model.\n* XLF, an ETF that tracks the performance of banks in the SPY, vastly outperformed the market today, closing 1.39% higher amid continued strength by financial stocks.  \nFacebook (FB) pauses the \u201cInstagram for kids\u201d project after lawmakers and the public voiced valid concerns. \n* Facebook (FB) also said it will invest $50 million to partner with organizations/companies to build the \u201cmetaverse\u201d, which is the name for a 3D, interactive, collaborative virtual space. In the latest earnings call Zuckerberg said \u201cIt is going to require very significant investment over many years\u201d. I\u2019m sure we will see many more headlines about this in year to come.\n* Order of durable goods, which are goods meant to last at least three years, in the US far exceeded estimates in August, suggesting that demand remains very strong despite supply-chain disruptions. Orders rose 1.8% in August, much higher than estimates of a gain of 0.7% and the 0.5% gain recorded in July.\n* Google criticized EU anti-trust regulators for ignoring Apple as it launches an attempt to get the second-higher cort to annul a record $5.1 billion fine related to its Android operating system. Regulators allege that in 2011, Google used Android to cement its dominance in internet search.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Barclays from $335 to $384 at Overweight.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 10, 2021**\n\nStocks extended their streak of underperformance, with the three major indexes falling once again for the fifth consecutive day of losses, one of the worst weeks for equities all year. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.78% down, closing out the week 1.57% down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also closed the day 0.78% down, closing the week out 1.3%. The Dow Jones (DIA), which primarily weights financial, industrial, and energy stocks, closed the day 0.75%, closing the week 1.91% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its roughly year-long streak of underperformance, falling 0.97% and closing the week 2.53% lower. All year, IWM has been trading between a range of $210 and $235, unable to break out, compared to the more than 15% year-to-date gain by the SPY. Market participants remain concerned with the surge in the coronavirus Delta variant and the potential negative impact it could cause the economy.\n\nFirst off, in geopolitical news, President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in months. Afterward, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was considering investigating Chinese subsidies and their effect on the US economy. Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said \u201cThe Sino-America relationship is in disrepair and today\u2019s call does not seem to change this. The US appears to list actions it wants China to take, while China\u2019s demands seem minimalist, quit demonizing it and respect its red lines. Yet its red lines strike at the very heart of international order, such as its claims on most of the South China Sea and its aggressive provocative actions in the region.\u201d This also comes amid extremely intense regulatory pressures by the CCP on Chinese tech stocks, many of which have an American listing.\n\nIn other news, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. \n\nMike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, \u201cAnyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this won\u2019t be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind we\u2019re still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.\u201d\n\nNow, this is absolutely massive news and will have huge consequences in the market moving forward, especially for companies who derive a large percentage of their revenue through the Apple Store. Today,  a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apple\u2019s 15-30% commission. Stocks like Roblox (RBLX), Bumble (BMBL), Zynga (ZNGA), and Spotify (SPOT) sharply gapped up after the announcement. I cannot stress how big this is, in 2020 Apple made $73 billion in revenue from the commission on App purchases.\n\nUnfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. \n\nThis weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Peloton (PTON) shares gapped up after the company announced it was launching an apparel brand. It\u2019s probably gonna be the same sort of clothes that are sold in Lululemon (LULU).\n* The crackdown in China continues\u2026 This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were \u201curged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.\n* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflare\u2019s was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.\n* The Italian Data Authority asks Facebook (FB) to provide clarifications on the use and function of the smart glasses to gauge whether the product is compliant with privacy laws. Like I said yesterday, I think the glasses are a bad product, don\u2019t see any use for them apart from very niche uses, like live-streaming. Not even to mention FB\u2019s absolutely appalling record when it comes to data privacy (remember Cambridge Analytica?)\n* Sales of cars in China fell for the fourth straight month amid the global shortage in semiconductors that have forced automakers across the globe to slash production.\n* Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla employees asking them to \u201cgo super hardcore\u201d to make up for production challenges to \u201censure a decent Q3 delivery number.\u201d The CEO also said, \u201cThis is the biggest wave in Tesla history, but we got to get it done.\u201d I hope they get it done, still waiting on my Model 3 :(\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with two target raises. Stock currently around $341\n   * Morgan Stanley from $330 to $380 at Overweight\n   * Bank of America from $324 to $379 at Buy\n* Shares of Affirm (AFRM) gapped up 34% after the company absolutely demolished earnings and raises guidance.
