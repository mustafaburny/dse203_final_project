(the \u201cCompany\u201d), a publicly traded company focused on raising capital for exploration mainly in the base metal and resource sectors. The Company is focused on providing investors with long-term capital growth by investing in a portfolio of undervalued companies and assets.\r\n\r\nOne such asset is the Jasper Property which is wholly owned by the Company. The property is located in west-central Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and consists of 4 mineral claims covering 3978 hectares.\r\n\r\nPrevious work done on the property included soil and rock sampling, geological mapping, drilling and limited geophysical work. This work confirmed the presence of lower Jurassic Bonanza Group, which comprises predominantly tuffaceous volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nMineralization discovered in outcrop over a 2.5 by 0.5 km area on the property consists of 15 sulphide zones. The results include: \r\n\r\n\u25cf\tOutcrop sampling included: zinc: 0.01% to 15.00%, copper: 0.09% to 8.38%, lead: 0.01% to 20.07%, gold: 0.019 g/t to 0.214 g/t and silver: 3.04g/t to 61.45g/t\r\n\u25cf\tDrilling results showed zinc: 0.146% to 11.570%, copper: 0.011% to 0.871%, lead: 0.003% to 6.330%, gold 0,006g/t to 0,05g/t and silver: 2.50g/t to 61.45g/t\r\n\r\nThe model given at the time was hydrothermally remobilized base metal mineralization related to either one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u25cf\tPolymetallic Veins Ag-Pb-Zn+/-Au.\r\n\u25cf\tEpithermal Au-Ag-Cu High Sulphidation.\r\n\u25cf\tCu+/-Ag Quartz Veins.\r\n\u25cf\tNoranda/ Kuroko massive Cu-Pb-Zn. \r\n\u25cf\tPorphyry Cu-Mo-Au.\r\n\r\nEither one of this type of geological settings may point to geological occurrences conducive to mineralization worthy of evaluation, by way of a drill program. Considerable technical re-evaluation is currently underway to take the geophysical interpretations into consideration. The results will be released once available.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe recent surge in copper price is quite encouraging for the future outlook of the Company. Every major economy in the world is preparing for an infrastructure boom which should be favorable for all base metal producers. The Company is well positioned to fully exploit this potential base metals boom and to bring value to its shareholders\u201d said Herb Brugh, President of the Company. \u201cThe Company is looking forward to the results of the re-evaluation becoming available.\u201d\r\n \r\n \r\nThe Qualified Person for the Jasper Property is Jacques Houle, B.A.Sc., University of Toronto \u2013 Geological Engineering \u2013 Min. Ex. Option P.Eng. since 1989 Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of B.C.\r\n\r\nCorporation contact:\r\n\r\nHerb Brugh\r\nPresident and Director\r\nTel:\t416.945.6630",
