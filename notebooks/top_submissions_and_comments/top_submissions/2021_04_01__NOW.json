In a small test, I bought 1000 shares at $.03 and it's at $.07 now. If I had invested a meaningful amount it would have made a significant impact on my account balance.\n\nSo, more penny stocks for me thanks to you guys and gals.

        "selftext": "Take it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. \n\nYou need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.\n\n1. Open webull \n\n2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively \"safe\" yet great returning etf. \n\n3. Go to the \"paper trading\" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). \n\n3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. \n\n4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. \n\n5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.\n\n6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed. No you are getting VTI gains plus if the stocks solid now itll be solid again in 6 months right? The goals a solid return not day trading 200% gains).\n\nPRO TIPS-\n\n-DO NOT FOMO SELL OR BUY STOCKS. I can not emphasize this enough. Ive bought in where things are gaining 5%/ hour and guess what? The stock within a week dropped back down to \"fill the gaps.\" I never believed that was a thing but ive watched it happen way too many times. About 99% of the time a stock i watchlisted shot up if i got it while going up within a  week it temporarily dropped back before rising again. \n\n-Do yourself a favor and avoid Wall s t r e e t b e t s \n\n-Never invest any money you arent willing to lose today. If you need the money soon (within a year in my opinion) and will need that full amount do not invest it. The market especially now is unpredictable. A lot of people lost a lot of money these last 2 months that they will either never get back or will be holding the bag they call it for years. \n\n- Contrary to popular belief... its okay to sell for a loss. This is a hard lesson and one many people will give you a hard time on saying \"BuY hIgH sElL lOw.\" Guess what? Sometimes we pick bad stocks/ etfs. Especially when you are new you will think you found the gold mind of a stock only for it to get bad news like the trial drug didnt get approved or they delayed production or loss a contract bid. Would you rather be down 20% and perhaps watch it keep going down more and hold that stock for years perhaps before it comes back up or would you rather accept the loss (which youll claim on taxes) and then reinvest in a solid company/ etf that will make that loss back faster. Of course this correction we were just in is an expection in someways because some companies will bounce back relatively quick but i forsee that there will be many people that bought in at all time highs who wont see a profit for a very long time. \n\n- In the same respect above you have to have discipline. Stocks dont only go up. You WILL have down days. Youll temporarily be in the red. This will be the pucker moment you decide if you regret buying that position or not. Be disciplined. \n\n-The same goes for being on top. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits if your stock happens to have a huge run up (knowing youll pay capital gains tax though). \n\n- DO NOT USE MARGIN ACCOUNTS \n\n- Avoid option trading for at least a year till you understand what you are doing and can pick good stocks to buy options for. You can lose so much money so fast. \n\n- these subs can be amazing and they can be toxic. Some people give great advice and others dont. Whatever someone tells you dont take it as fact. They may tell you that AMD will double in 6 months buy buy buy. But its your money not theirs you could lose. \n\n- CNBC gets a lot of hate but Squak box, fast money and mad money on Spotify or watching it live has some really good insight to the market. But again they dont always give great advice. \n\n- you have to decide what your plan is and what stocks/ etfs/ risk fits your life style and plan. \n\n- people are scared of dividends for no reason. Unless you are investing millions upon millions of dollars ignoring solid stocks and ETFs which pay dividends to \"avoid unnecessary tax events\" is silly. If you dont believe me look at an ETF like SCHD. calculate the max amount youll ever get in that account. Divide by shares and multiply by dividend rate. Its not that much in end that you pay taxes on.\n\n- as much as we all wanna make 200% every month on every stock thats so unbelievably unrealistic. Look at some of the biggest ETFs like VT, VTI, SCHA, SCHB, VXUS, etc. And see their YOY returns. That your goal.\n\n\nMy advice/ quick tid bit/ plan\n\nI attempted to beat the market. I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.\n\nMy current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). \n\nVTI- 70% \n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nSCHD- 10% \n\nQQQM- 7.5:\n\nQQQJ- 7.5%\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

        "selftext": " This latest installment of why $DGX is **still** the safest double up+ opportunity in the market will likely be my last update before earnings this month (baring eventful news). A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n**TL;DR again** \\- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.\n\n**Positions** \\- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kspcic1dqjq61.jpg?width=3480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05521960a236201679bbda237f3fb5997ad5270a\n\nOpen: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160\n\nAs previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**\n\n**The new stuff:**\n\n* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing: [**https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html)  \n\n   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new \"analyst\" price targets\n* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html)\n* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html)  \n\n   * [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic)\n* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings: [https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf)\n\n**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**\n\n* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.  \n\n   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS &gt; 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.\n   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases\n\nThe reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na\u00efve.** Reasons:\n\n* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.\n* **Political climate / stimulus** \\- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now \"recommending\" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.\n* **$$$$$$$** \\- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.\n\n**Price Expectations by EOY:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by Biden's tax policy, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2\n* Q1 Earnings 4/22\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I own close to 150k shares.\n\nI read the RethinkX report about the next revolution in food, you can find it here: https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture\n\nNewsflash: People like eating meat and demand is growing rapidly\nhttps://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/agricultural-outlook/meat-consumption\n\nNow this creates a tricky situation as global production can only follow demand if we scale production in ways that are rather harmful to the environment and - inherently - inefficient. We basically built the whole animal around the desired product, but we do not need the animal and it takes rather long to reach \"maturity\" and consumes too much resources along the way. Long story short - we need a more efficient method.\n\nEnter lab meat/fish. Here they produce meat with the help of cells and media in bio reactors, the same ones used for the fermentation of yeast. Same product but less of the downsides of traditional meat and fish:\n- Shorter production time\n- More cost efficient in the future (rough estimate says 2030)\n- no animals are harmed (unless you count the minimal itch it takes to get some cells)\n- one cow = tons of meat (all they need is cells from it)\n- can be produced in a factory, does not need land \n- way smaller CO2 footprint\n- better food quality, no friggin hormones everywhere\n- potentially to be consumed by vegetarians and vegans too (vegans questionable I know)\n\nOne of the most promising companies currently is BlueNalu (https://www.bluenalu.com/) aiming for production later this year. Now almost none of the companies are publicly traded at the moment, but I found a good vehicle to get access: Agronomics\nhttps://agronomics.im/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Agronomics-Corporate-Presentation-.pdf\n\nIf you are interested, I recommend reading the book \"Moo's Law\" by one of the founders, Jim Mellon. Overall extremely interesting new sector and also one that hits the nerve of the current society I think (everyone is becoming more environmentally aware).",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that BLNK is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. BLNK has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

Finally, if Schwab is buying TD then wouldn't it make more sense to use Schwab instead if TD, or is TD better? Also open to other ideas, I really do not want to be switching around. I am hoping to settle on one broker and stick with them for the long term. I am leaning toward Fidelity at this point.

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",

        "selftext": "When I look at the front page of WSB these days all I see are a bunch of virgins collectively asking, \"daddy, when is GME going to moon?\" Or, \"daddy, is the squeeze szuoze yet?\" Looking for reassurance and constantly refreshing WSB to feed your confirmation bias is not as good thing for sentiment. If you are cock sure about GME hitting $42069 then you don't need to read every goddamn comment on the daily GME thread or read every crayon laden TA post that tells you GME will moon on X date. Why is there such a need to have constant reassurance about GME mooning? Is it a possible FUD strategy? Think about it; you're conditioned to log on to WSB and get an instant dopamine hit because you saw a post about how GME is gonna moon any second now. What happens if this stretches on for months or even years? People might lose interest and, God forbid, exit their positions. GME is shaping up to be a solid long term play regardless of the short squeeze potential. Quit needing constant reassurance, it makes us look unsure and insecure. \n\nTL;DR: Nobody knows when GME will moon. Quit circle jerking and wearing out your dopamine receptors. If you're cock sure about GME mooning then STFU and HODL!\n\nPositions: $CUM 420@69, $ASS 69@420.",

I began from scratch, and feeling like I\u2019m quite understanding the basics.\n\nI am currently 23 years and willing to learn the art of investing. I savely would like to use \u20ac10.000 to start.\n\nAs I am young and still have enough on the side, I would like to invest in growth stocks. Ideally I would choose 6 companies in different sectors, which I think have a big future.\n\nThe list I will be researching:\n- Draftkings\n- Nio\n- Square\n- Uber \n- Boeing\n- Disney\n- Beyond meat\n- Palantir\n- Alibaba\n- Amd \n- Nvidia\n- and a esports organisation \n\nIf you guys have any more suggestions for growth stocks to research i would love to hear them.\n\nHowever, when I finally made a selection of the companies I have faith in and would love to follow I would like to start investing.\n\nA lot of people are suggesting the DCA is the most efficient. However I don\u2019t know if this als counts for the growth stocks.\n\nMy plan of investing right now is to put the 10k right now in the companies I selected (through ratio) and add up 1k every month with the same ratios.\n\nI would love to hear your opinions on this way of investing.",

        "selftext": "I got in at $13 after reading of it on wallstreetbets but ended up selling it at around $17 because I thought it\u2019s amazing that something I got from wallstreetbets actually went up, time to take profit. I was a pussy basically. Then I saw it went up to $30s then $100s then $300s and as many I started reading more on it but decided not to chase it. Then saw it come back down to $40 but just thought to myself I dodged a bullet, even though I could have stayed in at $13 purchase and not sell but it could be worse and I could have gotten it and $300. Then I saw it going back up and while all of this was happening I went balls deep reading the DDs on wsb/gme and really understood what was going on but again decided to stay away cause I didn\u2019t want anything close to betting. But clearly it didn\u2019t stay that way and my whole plan changed when I took my mothers to doctors, we were sitting in the waiting area and I had some heart to heart with my mother (she recently lost her brother and got sick right after) She went to use the restroom and I opened wsb and saw DFV post his account update. That happened to be exactly at the time when $GME had gone back up from $40s back to above $100s, but that day it was red. It dipped below $100 and I set the limit for $88 to go all in and guess what $GME low was that day.. around $86.5. I got my shares and right after it started going up.\nAnd it was the last time $GME dipped below $100. I consider myself extremely lucky I got a good buy point even though I was nowhere in the earliest of people who deserve all the returns in this more then anyone cause they believed in the stock from the start but I am so glad I got in this cause at that moment it felt so right. It still feels right. This was about 40 days back and i have deleted my stock account from my phone so I don\u2019t even think of selling it, I want..need this to change my life around, had pretty much the worst time of my life since I lost everything in 2018 and this seemed like the best way to do it. I put whatever I have now In gme and honestly it doesn\u2019t matter if I got in at $88 or $200 when it\u2019s at +$10000. It\u2019s good to be in this journey with you guys. Thanks to you guys I got in this and got this opportunity to see the worth. I believe in this company and I HOLD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSorry for any English mistakes, not my first language.

A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n**TL;DR again** \\- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.\n\n**Positions** \\- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gb2taxvojq61.jpg?width=3480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb95029912abbf651f90edff2079c88361902d4b\n\nOpen: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160\n\nAs previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**\n\n**The new stuff:**\n\n* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing: [**https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html)\n   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new \"analyst\" price targets\n* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html)\n* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html)\n   * [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic)\n* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings: [https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf)\n\n**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**\n\n* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.\n   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS &gt; 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.\n   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases\n\nThe reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na\u00efve.** Reasons:\n\n* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.\n* **Political climate / stimulus** \\- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now \"recommending\" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.\n* **$$$$$$$** \\- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.\n\n**Price Expectations by EOY:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by Biden's tax policy, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2\n* Q1 Earnings 4/22\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME.",
