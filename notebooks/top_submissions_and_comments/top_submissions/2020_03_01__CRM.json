        "selftext": "I have some long term holdings. I've trimmed down a little and have some cash. But I'm wondering if, instead of selling more of my AMZN, AAPL, etc... if I short sold say a few tech stocks like ADBE, CRM, CRUS,  etc... if that would essentially act as a hedge for my longs with the reasoning that if my tech longs go down then most likely other tech stocks will as well and I'd make money by shorting them as I'm losing money on the longs. \n\n(I realize that I could buy puts as well, but I have never done that yet and am not familiar with that even though I did just get an options account. But I'm wondering if shorting can essentially accomplish a similar task as I don't know if I have the time to learn options.)",
