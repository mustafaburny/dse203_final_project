        "selftext": "I'm sorry if this post is beating a dead horse, I just haven't seen this really drilled down - just sorta glossed over with a 1-10 rating. \n\nI was on ThinkorSwim, got pissed with their customer service (long story) and took my ball to Fidelity. Their platform, Active Trader Pro, is total shit. It's prettier than TOS, but the functionality just isn't on par - which I could get used to - but the glitches man...glitches. Half of my attempted orders get error messages; moving a stop is an ordeal, stocks disappear from my portfolio for days; on and on. Just can't do it anymore. So I may have to go back with my tail between my legs to TDA, but I'm interested in Webull, mainly for the extensive extended hours possibilities. But as you can see, the platform is huge to me. Honest assessments please: how is the Webull platform? Glitchy? Quick? Smooth? Slow? Lacking functionality? \n\nI'm mostly swing trading, if it matters, but run the occasional day trades.",
