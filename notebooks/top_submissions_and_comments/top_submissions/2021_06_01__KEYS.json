That made it a little better when sifting through the scum of posts with ass DD to find that diamond in the rough of someone who posted something NEW or actually added info instead of repeating the same echo chamber of a false hope that \u201c___ is the next BIG SQUEEEEZE\u201d \n\nHow about you gamma squeeze these nuts, shut the fuck up, and read instead of posting more bullshit for the mods to wipe clean like a triple-ply once-over clandestine shit sweep. These mods are heroes for listening to this cringy begging ape shit for months now, so try to make their lives easier and learn something in the process. \n\nToday was a bloodbath for memes, so welcome to fucking Valhalla you shit for brains monkeys, the keys to get out are on the next play if you managed not to lose it all or have another aunt to short squeeze. \n\nEnd rant \n\nSorry for probably breaking the rules mods, you guys rock.",

        "selftext": "You'd have to be blind to have not seen the chatter on here and other subs about $CLNE and the potential \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15 gamma squeeze event on 6/18. While the event is a realistic possibility and I'm buying more shares constantly to push it forward, the stock is also a great hold too.\n\nThe setup has been explained many times, and is basically a liftoff ramp up to an absolute rocket launch at the $13 price level, where 2.5 million shares worth of calls will be exercisable. They two keys are (1) shares must be bought to drive the price up, and low daily volume makes this drive pretty easy and (2) the call wall is firmly situated on June 18th, the target date.\n\n# But, this post isn't about the squeeze opportunity:\n\nIf you want to learn about $CLNE, I would recommend reading  the original DD from several weeks ago. There have been a couple of other good ones on here this week too. Here are some basics about the company that doesn't include the cocaine laden rants that most DD's are filled with. I've been chipping away at buying shares for weeks during this $8 strangle hold.\n\nIN short, CLNE takes Methane from waste sources like the dairy industry and landfills, captures it and converts it into (RNG) renewable natural gas, stores it, and then sells it. Their market focus is on selling to heavy transport/trucking and they position their infrastructure accordingly. \n\n* **Majorly superior to EV for this application for a few reasons.... Namely because it's faster to fill with RNG than to charge (time is money), batteries for EV's are super heavy (weight is money), and maintenance is the same as a standard engine (money is money).**\n* CLNE already has huge partnership with the likes of Total, BP, Chevron, LA mass transit, and **Amazon.**\n* **Amazon, as a part of their deal with CLNE, has the right to purchase tons of shares at the $13 price level. The price being the same  as the squeeze is coincidence.**\n* CLNE has been building their infrastructure out (stations, etc) with this in mind, purposely constructing them near Amazon warehouse/shipping centers. \n* Other common carriers have already started purchasing/converting fleets to RNG\n* Recently, California ports have started offering programs/subsidies to trucks that run RNG - part of their efforts to reduce emissions at the ports, improve air quality, and help the environment.\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\nProduct, infrastructure, sales, partnerships.... What is it missing? Volume. Various shorts have been beating it down for months and some restructuring by Total as well (they still own almost 50 million shares, don't worry). Buy shares, hold shares, rake tendies.\n\nThe June gamma play is still in play, and very possible. Tons of posts about it and most of them are on point with their potential. Some hype, some cocaine mixed in, but most good hearted. Cow farts and all else aside, I like the stock and believe it to be a solid hold with a 2x - 3x price potential and an obvious call options run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n^(I am a 895 share holder before today, bought 105 more to even out 1,000. I will hold through the year at a minimum, probably longer.)\n\n^(Disclaimer - this is not financial advice. My mom feeds me fruity pebbles with a plastic spoon each morning. Do your own DD and stuff!)",

        "selftext": "I've seen a lot of people suggesting BB's time has come and gone after their rise and fall last week. I'm here to show you that BB is still massively undervalued. I **really** like this stock, so below I've consolidated some of my favorite DD, with links at the end if you'd like to read more.\n\n# Products &amp; Customers\n\n* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.\n* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.\n* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.\n* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.\n* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.\n* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.\n\n# Cybersecurity Leader\n\n* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.\n* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.\n* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.\n* According to Frost &amp; Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.\n\n[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)\n\n# Some Basics and Fundamentals\n\n* BlackBerry has an \\~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.\n* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.\n* BB owns \\~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.\n* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...\n* Blackberry has a strong customer base or critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.\n* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.\n* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)\n\n# TL;DR: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.\n\n# Positions:\n\n* 2000 shares @ $11.20\n* 50 1/20/23 $40c\n* 50 1/20/23 $25c\n* 10 1/20/23 $10c\n* 20 6/11/21 $30 covered calls\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sorry for the Robinhood screenshot, I'll be using Fidelity after closing this position.](https://preview.redd.it/q1m9r7vanp371.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5acddc6abc1f4ff3378a774cfe79c93ab17582b)\n\n# Important DD's and Threads:\n\n* [Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/) \\- by u/whatisgf\n* [9 Reasons Why BB is \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 from former BB employee](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) \\- by u/josh_moworld\n* [BlackBerry, Why you need it.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5sno2/blackberry_bb_why_you_need_it/) \\- by u/DevantLaMachine\n* [BlackBerry -- A Dormant Giant](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li0rpg/blackberry_a_dormant_giant/) \\- by u/UncleZiggy\n* [$BB King - The Blacker the Berry, the Sweeter the Juice](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/leohs2/bb_king_the_blacker_the_berry_the_sweeter_the/) \\- by u/Rotatos\n* [BB is not a phone company.

        "selftext": "I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.\n\nUnder the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.\n\nThat is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.\n\nEdit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.\n\nI first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA (EZA) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.\n\nMy new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the South African Rand's inflation was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",

        "selftext": "GBTC is in the news lately due to ARK\u2019s recent investment. I was looking into it, just out of curiosity - for those who aren\u2019t aware, GBTC is an ETF whose underlying trust has only one asset - Bitcoin - and as a result, its market price mirrors BTC pretty much perfectly.\n\nWhat appeals to me is not having to worry about additional accounts and security related to crypto keys. As of right now, I don\u2019t hold any digital offerings, but I\u2019d like to expose myself to BTC and other (admittedly volatile) assets in a long-term fund.\n\nArticles that mention Grayscale Trust reference its 2% fee and $50,000 minimum, which are extraordinarily high for any typical market offering right now (obviously, BTC and other digital currencies aren\u2019t \u201ctypical\u201d investments by any means, but the opportunity cost of whatever i may invest in GBTC is like a total market fund like FZROX). But from my Fidelity account, it doesn\u2019t appear there is a minimum investment nor a holding fee. Is anyone familiar with this trust, and is the ETF (GBTC) different than the trust itself? If so, why would anyone invest directly in the trust?",

        "selftext": "Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE)\n\nJP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose \"enormous competitive threats\" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d with \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of \u201ca $16 trillion market cap\u201d.\n\nIn this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommon bear arguments:\n\n\\#1 Old business\n\n\\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat\n\n\\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult\n\n\\#4 No growth\n\n\\#5 Slow growth\n\n\\#6 Not profitable\n\n\\#7 Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.\n\n\\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell\n\n\\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1) Old business. \n\nPaysafe\u2019s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nMuch of Paysafe\u2019s business is in back-end payment processing so most don\u2019t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.\n\nPaysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They\u2019ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service.\u00a0\n\nIn preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.\n\nAs Chairman Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab\u2026I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet\u2026 It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. \n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe\u2019s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,\u201ca fortress. It\u2019s got a moat\u2026 We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion \"unbanked\" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors\n\nFrom SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: \u201cTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a winner in this space, you\u2019re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That\u2019s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we\u2019ve entered.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. \n\nSynergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a key pillar of Paysafe\u2019s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d (2, 4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4) No growth. \n\nIt\u2019s true that Paysafe\u2019s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:\n\n2017: $864 million rev\n\n2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)\n\n2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).\n\n2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)\n\nUnlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, \u201cexited low value referral channels\u201d and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.\n\nLooking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:\n\n\u2014Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)\n\n\u2014 Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)\n\nNot claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5) Slow growth. \n\nGoing forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe\u2019s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d\n\nIn the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:\n\n1 \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n\n2 \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n\n3 New Hampshire: \"Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n\n4 \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n\n5 \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n\n6 \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n\n7 \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n\n8 \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n\n9 \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n\n10 \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n\n11 \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n\n12 \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n\n13 \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n\n14 \"Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization\"\n\n15 \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n\n16 \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n\n2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n\n3 As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n\n4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20% more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6) Not profitable. \n\nPaysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, \u201cPaysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company\u2019s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.\u201d\nThese fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:\n\nRepay: -0.67,\n\nAffirm : -2.18,\n\nNuvei : -1.08,\n\nPaysign : -0.19.\n\nBill : -0.62,\n\nShift4 : -0.43\n\nAverage EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69\nIf you read their transcripts and presentations, you\u2019ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They\u2019ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&amp;A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7) Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.   \nPaysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d\n\nTheir 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: \u201cDebt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.\u201d \n\nOf the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:\n\nSquare: 77.8X\n\nRepay : 8.7X\n\nFiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X\n\nGPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X\n\nShift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA\n\nAffirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA\n\nPaysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA\n\nBill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA\n\nDepending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe\u2019s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they\u2019ll be able to fund M&amp;A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. \n\nThe common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it\u2019s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.\n\nImportantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley\u2019s time-tested M&amp;A playbook.\n\nBlackstone itself says (9), \u201cThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.\u201d With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?\n\nBlackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview Foley said, private equity\u2019s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d\n\nThis trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: \u201cCommitment of Paysafe\u2019s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders\u2019 belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.\u201d\n\nThe PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand both his M&amp;A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the \u201cThe Foley Network\u201d (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity\u2019s massive transactional volume). \nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, \u201cThe thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBesides, just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off-market trades to avoid price slippage. Therefore, we probably wouldn\u2019t even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings. Paysafe\u2019s fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk, especially from current price levels. Given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square\u2019s), once audited numbers are available, many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. \n\nAccording to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.\n\nImportantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.\n\nTotal FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 %\u00a0\n\nBlackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 %\u00a0\n\nCVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 %\u00a0\n\nOther Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 %\u00a0\n\nCannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 %\u00a0\n\nPIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 %\u00a0\n\n723,734,536 100.0 %\u00a0\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements (25% to 100% upon ticker change without any prior notice), to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays (7+ trading days) in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of \u201cfake sell walls\u201d and HFS \u201cshort ladder attacks\u201d as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. \n\nI think Paysafe is currently undervalued and, as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition, it is very likely a 3X from here.

CPE, which also provides electric supply pricing for commercial customers, will additionally enable Ozop to offer customers competitive electric supply through CPE, in States where competitive electric choice is available. Through CPE\u2019s advanced energy storage technology, facilities can save on energy costs with zero capital construction cost. This opportunity is in addition to other programs that Ozop can provide to its customers though its various subsidiaries and strategic relationships.\n&gt; \n&gt; CPE\u2019s patented solution uses the thermal mass within a building\u2019s envelope and interior mass as energy storage. CPE takes advantage of cooler nighttime temperatures and air conditioning efficiency to store electricity, converted into cooled air, stored in the building\u2019s mass and available to reduce demand, consumption, and costs during more expensive peak energy consumption times. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/03/f34/qtr-2015-chapter5.pdf), more than 76% of all U.S. electricity use and more than 40% of all U.S. energy use and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are associated with providing comfortable, well-lit, residential and commercial buildings. Saving energy in buildings translates directly into saving money, which are keys to economic recovery as well as long-term sustainability.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWe are pleased to participate with Ozop Energy Systems to offer their customers and companies access to CPE\u2019s advanced energy storage and management technology and customer electricity supply programs,\u201d said Ed Levene, Clean Peak Energy Group, LLC CEO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Said Brian Conway, CEO of Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc, \u201cThis strategic relationship with CPE further reinforces Ozop\u2019s growing Neo-Grid system of clean technology products and services to help building owners and operators reduce operating costs with safe and energy-smart facilities to make a positive impact for our country\u2019s energy transition challenges. We have agreements and letters of intent for hundreds of properties that we look forward to introducing to CPE.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; For more information on OZSC please follow on the link, www.OzopEnergy.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please be aware that our social media accounts can be used from time to time for additional material events.\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/15/2247657/0/en/Ozop-Energy-OZSC-Signs-Agreement-with-Clean-Peak-Energy.html",

The two keys to triggering this squeeze are as follows\u2026 \n\n1: It can\u2019t just break $15, it has to CLOSE above $15. We need to see WISH close and hold above $15, and this includes after hours. In other words, if it dumps below $15 in after hours, we lose. \n\n2: It must close above $15 before 7/16, which is an extremely important date in terms of contract expirations. That\u2019s not to say that all is lost after 7/16 by any means, but the gamma squeeze would likely be out of play. \n\n$WISH is a great stock and a mid to long term hold regardless in my opinion, but if we want to see a squeeze, these conditions must be met.

The COVID crisis is receding, the economic reopening is proceeding apace \u2013 but there are inflationary worries. The Biden Administration is committed to a heavy spending program, including generous extended unemployment benefits \u2013 which in some cases can exceed wages. As a result, the labor market is apparently stuck, running in low gear and prompting some concern that the recovery may not gain traction.\n\nTaking a macro view of the economic situation, Patrick Spencer, vice-chair of equities at Baird, is bullish on stocks and sees positive long-term prospects on the jobs front.\n\n\u201cThe earnings yield of the S&amp;P\u2026 for the next two years, you get a 5% earnings yield\u2026 and you\u2019re getting 1.5% in bonds. So, equities still are the only place to be... We\u2019ll see the leadership change from value stocks \u2013 cyclical stocks \u2013 back to growth towards the end of this year,\u201d Spencer opined.\n\nTurning his attention to the job situation, Spencer acknowledges that the high benefits may be keeping workers at home, but goes on to add that \u201c\u2026COVID support finishes in September, and at that point\u2026 that will change, and you\u2019re going to get those people back into the workforce.\u201d\n\nTurning Spencer's outlook into concrete recommendations, Baird analyst [Joel Beatty](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/joel-beatty) is pounding the table on two stocks that look especially compelling. According to the analyst, each name is poised to surge over 60% in the 12 months ahead. Using [TipRanks\u2019 database](http://www.tipranks.com/), we found out that both tickers have gotten a thumbs up from analysts at other firms as well.\n\n **Atreca, Inc.** **(**[**BCEL**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bcel/forecast)**)** \n\nThe first of Beatty\u2019s picks we\u2019re looking at, Atreca, is an early-stage biopharmaceutical research company focusing on oncological immunotherapies \u2013 that is, developing novel drugs which will stimulate the patient\u2019s own immune system to attack tumor cells and tissues. Atreca uses a proprietary technology to profile the patient\u2019s immune response, identifying antibodies and T-cell receptors that are the keys to successful treatments.\n\nAtreca has multiple pipeline projects in development, the majority still in pre-clinical phases. The company\u2019s lead candidate, ATRC-101, is currently undergoing a Phase 1 study, with 20 patients enrolled, evaluating the drug against several different solid tumor malignancies. The company reported that all patients have completed the three-week dose limiting toxicity assessment period, without adverse effects. Atreca is looking to enroll an additional patient cohort to assess a higher dose, and expects to release the initial summary data in July of this year.\n\nIn his coverage of Atreca, Beatty writes, \u201c\u2026we see favorable risk/reward heading into early clinical data in July for ATRC-101 in solid tumors. While we view the readout as high risk, we believe downside is limited due to 1) the newly announced pipeline agent targeting EphA2 (a target that has had recent validation by Bicycle Therapeutics), 2) the partnership with Xencor, and 3) the relatively low \\~$100M enterprise value implied by the current stock price.\"\n\nThe analyst added \u201cWe believe Atreca\u2019s unique antibody library has the potential to support a robust pipeline with multiple mechanism (T cell engagers, directed killing and toxin conjugates)\u2026\u201d\n\nTo this end, Beatty sets a $27 price target on this stock, suggesting a robust upside of 203% for the year ahead. Unsurprisingly, the analyst rates BCEL an Outperform (i.e. Buy). (To watch Beatty\u2019s track record, [**click here**](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/joel-beatty))\n\nIt\u2019s not often that the analysts all agree on a stock, so when it does happen, take note. BCEL\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 4 Buys. The stock\u2019s $29 average price target suggests a 225% and a change from the current share price of $8.91. ([See BCEL stock analysis on TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bcel/forecast))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Atreca, Inc. \\(BCEL\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/peo2hx0xf2471.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bcfc68d2e860b55cc871c2ae9318a75f8565558)\n\n**Syndax Pharmaceuticals (**[**SNDX**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndx/forecast)**)**\n\nThe second Beatty pick we\u2019re looking at is Syndax, another biopharma company. This research-based firm is working on combination therapies for multiple cancer indications. The company\u2019s pipeline includes two main drug candidates, axatilimab and SNDX-5613.\n\nSyndax has two clinical trial programs ongoing. AGAVE 201 is a Phase 2 trial of axatilimab, testing the drug as a treatment for patients with \u2018recurrent or refractory active chronic graft versus host disease.\u2019 Axatilimab is a monoclonal antibody that act through blocking the colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor. The study is testing three different dosing levels. Results from earlier testing will be released later this year; the AGAVE study results are expected to be released in 2023. Axatilimab was granted an Orphan Drug designation by the FDA earlier this year.\n\nThe second clinical trial is for SNDX-5613. This trial, AUGMENT 101, is a Phase 1 study, testing the drug candidate against MLLr leukemias. In pre-clinical testing, the drug blocked the menin-MLL1 interaction, leading to tumor cell death. Early data from the AUGMENT 101 study showed 48% overall response rate among patients.\n\nBeatty sees three positive factors for Syndax going forward, including: \u201c1) \u2026 the potential for success for SNDX-5613 in NPM1 patients is underappreciated, 2) the company appears to be largely or completely funded through registrational data for both SNDX-5613 and axatilimab in 2023, and 3) we see potential for upside from business development, leverage SNDX\u2019s business development and clinical development strengths.\u201d\n\nIn line with these upbeat factors, Beatty rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $31 price target implies a 12-month upside of 65%. (To watch Beatty\u2019s track record, [**click here**](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/joel-beatty))\n\nOverall, SNDX has received5 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 4 Buys versus just 1 Hold and making the analyst consensus rating a Strong Buy. The 12-month average price target stands at $27.40, marking \\~46% upside potential from current levels.

Vanguard and Bogle are pioneers in finance and have helped more Americans achieve capital growth and social mobility than any government program could ever dream of. However this post is about the ridiculous circlejerk and cult-like behavior that has stemmed from it.  \n\nSo there is a thread right now with a guy asking how to generate income with six figures in cash he has. The entire thread is this: \n\n\"Throw it in VTI and call it a day\" \n\n\"Buy an index fund and hold. Don't look for the needle, buy the haystack!\" \n\n\"SPY and VOO\" \n\n\"PLTR 0DTE Calls!\" \n\n\"I have an aggressive portfolio\" - *has a quarter of their portfolio in government bonds and the rest in VTI* \n\nSo while all of this is good and dandy for investment advice, the ridiculous amount of Boglehead anti-risk circlejerking is getting on my nerves.

The right response would be something like a covered call strategy or a high dividend yield investment, not a \"set it and forget it\" portfolio from Vanguard. \n\nBogleheads in recent times have become the financial equivalent to Jehova's witness - going door to door about how the world is going to end and how all the stock pickers are peasants who will face the wrath of god when the rapture occurs. \n\nIf you don't want to actively pick stocks, thats ok. Nobody is forcing you too. But please stop telling everyone else that they should do the same. Everyone has a different risk profile and given the amount of teens and 20 years olds on here, their risk tolerance far exceeds anything propogated by the three funds portfolio, and they still have the time to take advantage of that fact. \n\nThis subreddit and every other sub about investing are naturally oriented towards actively managed portfolios. We discuss interesting companies, investment philosophies, and all the ways to manage a hands-on approach to portfolio management. This conversation is the antithesis of passive investment because with passive investing, all you do is buy some funds and that's it - no more discussion. Nothing else is necessary because the philosophy of passive investing is \"set it and forget it\" except Bogleheads forgot the second part, and they want everyone else to do the same apparently.",

This DD does not go into technical analysis or any conventional stock market information. I made this choice because AMC &amp; GME are not conventional. At all. The numbers, the graphs, the dips, short interest, the failure to deliver; none of it matters here. None of it. With the amount of manipulation here none of it fucking matters. The only thing that matters is them and us. It is a war whether you want to see it or not. And the only way they can win is to get into our heads and manipulate most of us to sell. Get us to sell so we no longer own the float. And they have all the resources and all the experience in the world to do just that. If you want to know more you\u2019re going to have to read this shit. Or you can just bye and hodl. But I\u2019d still read this because as a student of Psychology, I can tell you that EVERYONE believes they can\u2019t be manipulated and EVERYONE is wrong. The only way to protect yourself against it, is to understand it and to see it plainly for what it is. \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is extremely important so I will be posting this across various subs in case it is taken down, apes can still find it and I am going to try to make this as easy to follow as I possibly can.

What is Psychological Warfare?** \n\nPsychological Warfare or Psywar for short is the use of propaganda against an enemy. It can be supported by military, economic, or political measures as needed. Here is a link to Britannica that goes further into it. \n\n[https://www.britannica.com/topic/psychological-warfare](https://www.britannica.com/topic/psychological-warfare) \n\n\\- Here is a screenshot if you don\u2019t care for links. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tl7uv4apqn471.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e10f14f6ccc2f4b96ebb74ddffacedd293d0415b\n\nNow, this can be done even without propaganda. Our understanding of the human mind has greatly improved in the last few hundred years in a way that is and should be classified as terrifying. \n\nThe benefits of understanding the human mind are great and have allowed us to treat disorders and inner conflicts we never even knew existed Back then along with new disorders and inner conflicts arising everyday. You can bet your ass So many more will emerge Soon? As a result of the CoronaVirus Pandemic. \n\nThe official count of just the disorders that we have come to identify sit around 157 in the DSM-5 which is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This is the handbook used by healthcare professionals in the United States and there are many, many more disorders that we are discovering every single day and that are being discovered all over the world. \n\nI mention this to show you how far we are in understanding the complexities of the human mind. \n\nI will also go one step further to prove to you how easy it is to manipulate you. I am considered by some to be an expert in manipulation. It is part of my profession and my objective is to engage in delicate and extremely subtle manipulation in order to generate great profit for my Law Firm which I\u2019ve done so very successfully. I have in the span of 3 or so years made settlements totaling out to over 1 Billion dollars in profit by harnessing this technique effectively. \n\nI will now do that with you. If you have read this far then I have already implanted a thought in your head. I will reveal that thought to you in the end but until you get there I ask you to see if you can figure out exactly what I\u2019ve manipulated you to think of. It won\u2019t be obvious like \u201cbye and hodl\u201d and some of you might have already figured it out but I would heavily wager that very few of you have. \n\nThe idea of Psywar can be traced back thousands of years and was written about by the ancient Chinese military strategist, Sun Tzu. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o5sn28yqqn471.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f3716e7ca7afa444cd902d105162d8dc1adb3e\n\nSun Tzu said that \u201cOne need not destroy one's enemy. One need only destroy his willingness to engage.\u201d \n\nImagine that. Imagine not even needing to fight or risk your life to defeat your opponent. This is a human achievement like no other. This is power. If I can destroy you from my chair at my computer desk without having to step one foot outside of my house, well then, what chance does anyone have? \n\nHow can you defend against something you can\u2019t even see coming? \n\nThis is the art of true war. And whether you realize or not, you are in that very war every single day. And the beauty of it is that you don\u2019t even know it. This is Psychological Warfare. \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part B. The Application of Psywar in WW1 and WW2** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3voc8esqn471.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=615e5d2c7ca22bab5f18ee27bc44aa1284ac9742\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smnjslzsqn471.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=151020840af2d51944d88ab94326542e39552817\n\nThis part is important. If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cOh no, come on, just to get to the point. Why do I need the history lesson? I believe you, it\u2019s real. Just tell me what I need to know now\u201d, then you need to read this more than every other ape that didn\u2019t think that. If you do not know your history then you are doomed to repeat it. \n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this before. But do you know why? Do you understand why you are doomed to repeat the same mistakes so many human beings have already made? \n\nThe answer is simple. Because you are them. You are your ancestor. The people that came before you felt and thought a lot of things the same way you feel them now. Sometimes we imagine they were so different. Completely different. That we are smarter and more evolved. But we\u2019re not. Not really. Not without history. You can struggle to reinvent a wheel that has already been invented or you can look at the blueprints of the wheel that has already been built and build on that. That is power. \n\nYour parents and the parents of your parents made mistakes, so many mistakes. And you can either learn from their mistakes and by doing so make it so their sacrifices were not in vain, or you can make the same mistakes in an endless loop. \n\nSo, your options are simple. Be lazy and don\u2019t learn about history, then repeat mistakes others have already made and fall the same way. Or learn history. Learn from the mistakes and then do better. I am certain that this option is the one your ancestors would have hoped for. The reason I know this is because I am hoping that my children and their children are infinitely better than I was. \n\n1. **World War 1**\n\n* In WW1 they used leaflets, loudspeaker broadcasts and radio messages with the goal of destroying enemies with a pen over the use of a sword. \n* Persuasion is impossible to measure precisely but it is evident that through the means of Psywar, many lives were saved in WW1 and the War was shortened drastically. \n\nHere is a link for Wikipedia going into this. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological\\_warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare)\n\nHere is an excerpt for those who don\u2019t click links. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hz3tm4uqn471.png?width=1649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4388a57fb1739312489ef6e14adbbb8c5686078d\n\n1. **World War 2**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79yyfe1vqn471.png?width=1649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fb65802dbb6d48197f2faa42fd4a88dc5b481e1\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part C. Psychological Manipulation Today\u2026**\n\nNow, this recommendation is going to seem very silly. But it\u2019s not. If you think it is then once again, you need to watch it the most because chances are you are already wrapped around someone's finger and you don\u2019t even know it. Or maybe you do and you don\u2019t care because someone has manipulated you so that you wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nMost people think that to manipulate someone is to just lie to them. But the strongest manipulation and the way I influence others is with the TRUTH. I don\u2019t even have to lie to you. I can destroy you by being honest with you. The best comedian in my opinion out there in the world living today is 30 years old and he understands this perfectly. His name is Bo Burnham. \n\nHis new special touches heavily on this subject. In my honest opinion it\u2019s a fucking masterpeice. I would dare argue that it is the single greatest work of Art on Netflix.\n\nAnyway, in his special he dives into how the internet has essentially stolen your life from you by inviting you in constantly with all of the information all of the time. He shows you how companies manipulate you to buy their products by buying the \u201cbrand\u201d and how companies are capitalizing on the fact that you can just stay the fuck inside. You don\u2019t need to live life. For what? There\u2019s nothing more interesting out there that can possibly compete with the internet. The only reason you should ever exist outside of your screen is to make more content for your screen. \n\nI have children that are all very young and I along with my partner decided that it would be a strength to give them full access to the internet before they were even a year old. We thought that the sooner they were exposed, the stronger of a resilience they can build later in life. That they would know how to use it effectively unlike so many of us do today. In doing that, I studied my children to see how they responded to being exposed to technology at such an early age. And it frightens me. If I walk into their room with a phone or tablet, they will drop EVERYTHING and run to me to try to grab it. When using the technology they lose sense of time completely and will stay up for hours past their bedtime lost in whatever device they are using. They will ignore us, they will ignore food and even their favorite toys because technology is more interesting even to an infant, than anything else in the world. \n\nThis is dangerous. This is dark and horrifying. This is mass control of human beings on a grand scale and you don\u2019t even know that half of it. Or maybe you do. And you naively believe this gives you power over the influence. \n\nI\u2019ll tell you a secret. Specifically about my strategy. It works often. Most of the time I can manipulate just about anyone, but do you know who it works on all of the time? Do you know who I can always manipulate? Effortlessly. \n\nIt\u2019s the people who are certain that they can\u2019t be manipulated. The arrogant ones. Oh, I love those people. They are so easy I can manipulate them in my sleep. And the reason I can do it is because arrogance is a weapon for me, it\u2019s not their weapon or their shield. I\u2019ll say that again. Your confidence and your arrogance is my strongest weapon. The people who constantly doubt themselves and overanalyze everything are significantly more difficult to manipulate but those who think they know everything? They are the weakest link. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yst627vvqn471.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd09beac46fd4253adf20eab3fc3c59146fddba8\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part D. Psywar in The Stock Market**\n\nNow, for this section I have decided that I will not give you the keys to the kingdom. Not because I don\u2019t love you. But because I do love you. All of you Apes. You give me hope. So here is a link and some pictures to help you build your key. \n\nOnce you can mold your own key you can teach your children. Your family. And that, in my opinion, is the greatest gift I can give you. \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/02/110502.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/02/110502.asp)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ngiraywqn471.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7413d4c1dcdd3db0c1c3f441e78eefa8806eff26\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggkemdhxqn471.png?width=1245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f04ae716540498a89d082d93e707e5fdac628388\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtcfyh0yqn471.png?width=1252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ddaeffb419b61c4cb1263118fcfe6dc494805e\n\nThe Final Part: Goodbye until later \n\nMy name is Nova. It really is. I love my name because people always think it must be made up or it\u2019s an alias. But it\u2019s really my name. My parents are pretty clever so they decided to name me \u201cNew\u201d. And my reddit name is TheNovaTerrae. For those who don\u2019t already know, in Latin that means A New World. \n\nBelieve me or don\u2019t. I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t make a difference. And honestly, I don\u2019t think anything does. See, I believe that in the same way we have all become slaves to our technology, we have also merged with it somehow. We\u2019ve become technology. And that is in a fucked up way, our greatest strength in this War. \n\nThe Hedge Funds and the Banks and all of those assholes, they are going up against the internet. Anything and everything all of the time. Apes may be individual retail investors. But in a way we are one organism, learning faster than the speed of light. We know too much too fast and the premise is simple, bye &amp; hodl. So...I\u2019ve been struggling to figure out how to best play my part for the squeeze and in writing this really weird DD that I\u2019m sure many are going to argue doesn\u2019t even belong here since I barely even mention the only stocks that matter, GME and AMC, something dawned on me. \n\nI don\u2019t have anything more to contribute because I believe that we have already won. I have become arrogant. I am certain that we cannot lose without a shred of doubt. Therefore I feel there is nothing left to do, except to bye and hodl. I don\u2019t need to learn anything else. I don\u2019t need to have my guard up. I don\u2019t need to write anymore DD\u2019s. I don\u2019t need to go on YouTube or Reddit or Twitter. I don\u2019t even need this community anymore. I am all knowing and with my incredibly vast knowledge and experience, all I need to do is bye and hodl. \n\nDo you get it? \n\nBecause if you don\u2019t. \n\nIf you have no idea what I am trying to say. \n\nThen you lose. \n\nYou have already lost. \n\n* So I\u2019ll leave you with this. I was going to deconstruct Adam Aron\u2019s interview with Trey but I looked into it and it\u2019s beautiful. I would do it a disservice by breaking apart before the squeeze. I would be helping the hedgies. And I won\u2019t help you. If you\u2019re reading this, my beautiful enemy, know this. I will never help you. Fuck you. \n\nTo the beautiful Apes, you can win this war. Continue to learn from each other. Grow and mold your keys. Fill each other up with confidence and positivity. Have fun. Enjoy the journey. Love your families. Put down your phones for a moment and just play in the world. Be bored. It\u2019s okay. The world will not implode. Your phone isn\u2019t going anywhere. Your time is. Your life and the lives of those you love. Those will disappear someday. They are the most valuable thing you have. \n\nSo bye. Hodl. Hodl all the way until the end and even then. And bye. \n\nI will see you all, on the other side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64bgyu2zqn471.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54891c4c199889e0be977fc9fa045f91cea4c25b\n\nSo, now I\u2019ll tell you exactly how I manipulated you. \n\n**FINIS.**",

        "selftext": "I got out the crayons and did some DD on BB. Here is part of what I wrote and the charts are in the links as is the full commentary.\n\nWhat's next for BB? That is the question. One thing for certain is that Blackberry is becoming a volatile stock. That's a good thing! It means it is no longer a dead stock with a dying company. For all intent and purposes it was for years for the average investor. In my last DD (on [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BB/uqgZAZNT-The-next-move-for-BB-Up-down-sideways-or-the-moon/)), I made a bull case for Blackberry. I think that still stands. I'm personally more excited for BB! BB is a long favored stock to short sided traders and it continues to attract them. It also continues to attract long sided traders and it keeps making some impressive gains. It also keeps making wild moves up and down. That means it could go up and start making higher highs like it has twice this year and then making higher lows. The upper green line on the 4 hour and daily seem to be support and the trend seems to be making a new base around that higher green line. If this continues the yellow dotted lines are the next upward resistance levels.\n\nWhat would those prices look like? **The dotted yellow lines are upward resistance (29.31, 32.64, 42.54, 68.16, 85.17, 125.14, and 149.65) and some date back several years.** I used daily and 4 hour time frames to get a taste of recent trades going backwards. It is worth by the way looking at the monthly and yearly charts. BB has already made one amazing bounce back from stock oblivion. Day traders, algos, and professional traders will use those upward and lower levels as keys for both going long and for shorting. Honestly, we all invest in part because we want to make money.Does this mean BB is going to be a 100 stock this year? Nobody knows but it could hit it. It could hit and fall back to prior supports or fall completely out. My best guess is that it will hit really high levels mentioned above then fall back to the 20-30s.It depends in part on investors and the likelihood of expansion. \n\nSome other so called memestock like AMC will have a hard time expanding to new areas of business and justifying a sustained higher price. They are using their new found investments to grow their business and time will tell if Wallstreet will consider if their new price is sustainable in the long term. GME on the other hand is working on a new business model and expanding their current offerings. They used the memestock surge to rebuild their brand. BB can likewise do so and like GME it has over the last several years and especially the last two years created strategic monetizable growth in the Internet of Things and Cyber Security sector. BB much like F has gone from junk stock status to a highly tradable stock. BB has yet to get the Wallstreet endorsement like F. **If mainstreet turns in mass towards BB then it can continue to build a base that larger players can use to push higher prices and more importantly sustain higher highs.**\n\n**Should you buy and hold? Should you short because all this is a bunch of wishful thinking? I can't tell you. I'm not a financial advisor and this is purely for information and entertainment purposes. The question is do you like BB as a stock?** Personally, I have my suspecisions on what will happen. I like the stock. I don't know about BB to the moon, or 500K a share, but there are clear upward targets in my mind that seem like a pretty good investment for me. Check the chart on [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BB/uqgZAZNT-The-next-move-for-BB-Up-down-sideways-or-the-moon/) and make your own decision!\n\nTL:DR; Just read it or buy and hodl with no DD because some stranger challenged you too if you are into that sort of thing. Not investment advice seriously. Stay in school. Don't do drugs. Never invest more than you can lose. Be careful with Marge N, she's a fickle mistress. Always listen to the B side of the album first.",

        "selftext": "There is a game that is currently in beta for residents of US/Canada named **Coin Hunt**  that is a geo-location game, like Pokemon Go, except you get paid to  hunt and you are encouraged to grow your community! The founder of this  game is the CEO of a popular cryptocurrency exchange named Bittrex. The  game also gets updates/events frequently, usually every couple weeks.  What I really like about this game is that you aren't really pushed to  leave your house everyday unless you want to overachieve on your  earnings, it is perfectly fine to stay home because there is passive  income in this game! For example, you basically earn about atleast $1 a day for just checking in to your home base in the game. Tens of  thousands of users are currently playing, and the most dedicated people  have earned maybe a thousand a month. I recommend treating it as a  marathon rather than a sprint though!\n\n**Use this link if you are interested in playing:** [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)\n\n*Note: There is a Canada Day and July 4th event coming up with a free exclusive costume, don't miss it!*\n\n**What do you do in the game?**  Since this is a geo-location based game, you have to go outside and  move around and the app will follow your position on the map. The two  things you'll find on your map is either a blue key or a coloured vault.  The colour of the key/vault represents its rarity, with the order of  common to most rare being blue-green-yellow-red-purple. You can use 10  blue keys to craft a green key, or 10 green keys to craft a yellow key,  so on. Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.\n\nBlue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC/ETH  \nGreen keys reward  you with $1  \nYellow keys reward you with $10  \nRed keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  \nPurple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)\n\nThe passive income mainly comes from checking in to the game, which as  mentioned before gives $1 a day, or from vaults that you've placed  around the world. So every user can place a total of 10 vaults anywhere,  and when any other player opens your vault you are rewarded 5% of the  resource. This means every 20 people that open your vault, would be the  same as you going out and opening someones vault (or your own). This  means if you place your vaults in spots that have a lot of user traffic,  you will be rewarded well without even having to leave your house. User  vaults can only be placed in areas where there is something  interesting, which includes stores and businesses, just anything that  isn't your house. Other people cannot place their vaults within 100 metres of your vault. This is why it's important to start playing while  the game is in beta!\n\n**There  are also in-game costumes available in the game, with limited  quantities, which you will be able to sell in the future when the game  is out of beta.**\n\nThe game  is great, I really recommend starting as soon as you can! When you first  start the game, you start with 8 blue keys and you just need to find 2  blue keys to craft a green key and build your home base, and you will  unlock all of the essential features of the game.\n\n**For Android:**  The game is available on the google play store, just download the game  and then use the link to open the application and complete the signup with freebies.\n\n**For IOS:**   Apple does not approve beta applications on their store quickly, so  you must use TestFlight to download the application instead.\n\n* Download TestFlight ([https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664))\n* Download Coinhuntworld ([https://testflight.apple.com/join/2jlFVFVq](https://testflight.apple.com/join/2jlFVFVq)).\n* Once the app is downloaded, don\u2019t open it yet Click the following link to open the app. [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)\n\nBelow is the wiki and subreddit for this game, the wiki has all the information that you will need!  \nWiki: [https://coinhuntworldwiki.com/Main\\_Page](https://coinhuntworldwiki.com/Main_Page)  \nSubreddit: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CoinHuntWorld/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinHuntWorld/)",

        "selftext": "So a little bit of background on my portfolio, I've been investing since March of last year, and was on a great run until mid-February which got me thinking that I should probably diversify my portfolio a bit. As you can probably guess most of my stocks have been \"covid stocks\" and tech stocks. Below is the full breakdown:\n\nARKK 8% \n\nAAPL 6.9%\n\nQQQ 6%\n\nNET 5.5%\n\nSQ 4.8%\n\nCRWD 4%\n\nARKW 3.8%\n\nCRM 3.4%\n\nARKG 3.1%\n\nPD 3%\n\nTWLO 3%\n\nPYPL 2.86%\n\nAMD 2.8%\n\nBA 2.8%\n\nMSFT 2.7%\n\nROKU 2.5%\n\nNVDA 2.45%\n\nBABA 2.4%\n\nPTON 2.36%\n\nTAN 2.26%\n\nSPLK 2.2%\n\nTSM 2.2%\n\nDKNG 2.13%\n\nTSLA 2%\n\nREGN 1.85%\n\nFB 1.8%\n\nNIO 1.57%\n\nTWTR 1.5%\n\nJD 1.4%\n\nPLT 1.1%\n\nCOIN 1%\n\nGot these other stocks that are less than 1% of the portfolio, WKHS, SRPT, XL, QS, and APPS.\n\nI probably won't withdraw funds from my account for another 3 years. My thinking is to cut my portfolio down to 15-20 stocks/ETFS, and probably add in some value stocks such as JPM and DIS. Any suggestions on what stocks/ETFS I should get rid of or invest more in?

        "selftext": "Hey all, doing a bit more brainstorming on income ideas. I noticed some fairly large spreads on deep ITM verticals. This example isn't too deep in the money, but illustrates the point. This an $NVDA JUN 4 680/690p spread. Assuming it was bought at or about mid it would be about $8. Assuming that $NVDA is at or below $680 shortly before close (or when assigned) we should be able to execute the long leg and receive $10. This would give us a $2 profit on what we paid. \n\nThat sounds all well and good, but I did some backtesting with this idea. The curious part comes one expiration day when the spread is extremely further ITM or the short leg is slightly ITM. The pricing in the former you'd actually get much more than the cost-the difference in the spreads and the latter much less. Lack of sleep and these funny cigarettes is making me miss as to why.\n\nAnyone have info? Am I missing something big here? Experiences in cash flowing this way? Thanks again!",
