        "selftext": "[Position Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/6csObKs)\n\nLumber Liquidators (LL) stock has been beaten down for years but the company is actually making a turnaround. They had issues in the past with product quality, but they have 420 stores across the USA. These stores are small (like 5000sq.ft) and they only have 2 employees per store, but the average store does $2.6 million in revenue per year. It's one of the highest sales per sq.ft in all of retail.\n\nHere is where it gets interesting. The stock used to trade at over $100, but has since fallen to $7. Housing and renovation stocks took a bath in 2018 and 2019, but in 2020 housing is staging a huge turnaround due to tight supply and low interest rates. The housing and renovation indexes ITB and XHB are now at all time highs. LL has been lagging, but the same store sales comps going forward are super easy because the company had a terrible 2019. They should be able to post comps in 2020 of 5%.\n\nAlso, the company will receive $25 million from the government because they overpaid on tariffs last year. They are literally getting a check from the gov for $25 million. \n\nAnd in December, the company upped their guidance for 2019. And they will announce earning next week. This was their December [press release](http://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=114672187&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=LL&amp;companyName=Lumber+Liquidators+Holdings+Inc&amp;formType=8-K&amp;dateFiled=2019-12-12&amp;CK=1396033 ).\n\nI have 25,000 shares this morning and plan to buy more. I also have 140 calls for Jan 15, 2021. I really do believe in the company and I see it as a much safer bet than some of the tech stuff which it trading at massive valuations.\n\nThe best way to play this is with call options. The close term Feb 28, $8 calls are trading at $0.50. I think this stock will see a huge bump on earnings day (Feb 25) and these could easily be worth $2. (I plan to buy 100 of these calls). \n\nAlso, for a longer term play, the Jan 2021 $13 calls are trading at $0.60. I am thinking the stock should easily reach at least $15 by the end of the year, so these should be $2. It's a triple and you have a whole year to get there. And if it can get to $20, (it was at $26 less than 2 years ago) you will more than 10x your money. (I have 140 of these calls).\n\n*ALSO* The short interest in LL shares is almost 40%. When this stock starts running there will be an epic short squeeze, even worse than what happened with TSLA. It will go up by dollars at a time. And volume is pretty tight and just last week there were [filings](http://investors.lumberliquidators.com/sec-filings ) by Blackrock (owns 16%),  Vanguard (owns 6.4%),  Neil Gagnon (owns 4.8%) and  T. ROWE PRICE (owns 5.7%). So, over 30% is owned by these 4 firms, plus in total almost 80% is owned by [institutions]( https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ll/institutional-holdings ). The 40% short interest will be difficult for shorts to unwind given the light volume. Any covering will send shares much higher on any good news. \n\n*Remember, LL shares doubled in 2 weeks last August when the founder tried to buy back the company - This thing has legs*",

        "selftext": "I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don\u2019t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.\n\nChina today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).\n\nChinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&amp;name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that\u2019s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.\n\nIn December 2019, a Moody\u2019s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China\u2019s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.\n\nThis was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering \u201chigh yield products\u201d to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, \u201cbecause the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.\u201d This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.\n\nThis is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron\u2019s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:\n\n&gt;One area, in particular, is back at the forefront\u2014local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities\u2014China\u2019s top two schools\u2014found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.\n\n&gt;Put another way, 85% of China\u2019s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.\n\n[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China\u2019s exposure to the world economy. I\u2019m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:\n\n&gt;In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China\u2019s] total GDP growth.\n\n&gt;In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.\n\nWhile 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&amp;P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don\u2019t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon\u2019s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.\n\nAll of this comes on top of Boeing\u2019s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China\u2019s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. \n\nIn addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.\n\nTo summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing\u2019s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.\n\nTL;DR: China\u2019s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing\u2019s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.",

Recently, some pumpers have been able to leverage the size of this community to pump stocks. \n\n**The reason** u/closethefuckinglight **was banned:** \n\nFirst, though not a reason for the ban but an important fact, the user's post on $LL was his first on reddit although he had an account greater than 3 years of age. He used the platform for personal gain by moving markets. \n\nHere is how u/closethefuckinglight was able to move markets:\n\n* The user took a position on a highly shorted, small cap company ($LL has a short interest of 38%, $MIK at 49%)\n* The user posted DD on this sub on the name. Due to the low attention span of users, a post of greater than a paragraph was taken as genius thinking. Users and others that visit the forum then bought calls in large amounts (Call volume on $LL was 73x the 20d average; see: [https://imgur.com/a/iisk8fd](https://imgur.com/a/iisk8fd) taken at 1pm EST)\n   * Posting DD is a good thing. However, it was obvious this user had the intention of pumping. Inn the future, DD should be on stocks that are not penny stocks or small caps. \n      * To those that say this is no different than Citron posting a research piece, tough shit.\n* The large amount of call buying forces market makers to delta hedge their short delta positions by buying stock. When call buying is as widespread as it was yesterday, this causes moves (especially in the low float, penny stock names favored by the poster) \n* Naturally, this causes the underlying to rise and users (including the poster) profit. \n\n**Let's revisit a few rules now (specifically number 8):**\n\n* No penny stocks (stocks under &lt;$10 or market caps below $1bn); users who violate this, will be banned\n   * \"Ford is under $10 and it's not a penny stock\" \n      * \"Go take your shitty dividend and head to r/investing\"\n* No pumping. Period. \n\n**Other actionable items:**\n\n* Any posts or comments on $MIK will be banned. \n* Users seen commenting on posts of u/closethefuckinglight relating to markets in his personal subreddit will be permanently banned. \n\nr/wallstreetbets was created to allow users to discuss higher risk plays. Recent pumping is not in the spirit of this sub, is against the rules, and may be market manipulation.",

        "selftext": "Thought I would add something for a change, take this FWIW. Here is my strategy: \n\n1 - DCA\nI am buying this week. I will be buying next week and the week after. Catch a falling knife, wait for the bottom, blahs blahs blahs. I am buying. I am mostly in index funds, although I have positions in several large companies also. I have been around a while, possibly longer than many people here. I was also buying in 2008 when people were freaking out and I have done quite well\n\n2 - Unsubscribe from this sub\nSeriously. This place has become a fear mongering echo chamber lately. Last week people were asking if they should buy at all time highs. Now people are shitting themselves because everything is on sale. I am going to Unsubscribe and try to focus more on my side hustles to generate more cash for buying (see item #1). I am not saying this to be a dick. I am saying it because it is legit unhealthy to freak out and surround yourself with other people that are freaking out.\n\nTake a deep breath. New flu strains surface from time to time, it is very cyclical. Yes, things will get a little worse, but it will rebound and people who buy will be the beneficiaries (don't buy with your rent money obviously,  just be smart). Watch what happens when a vaccine is announced.\n\nJust my two cents. I am going to Unsubscribe now and go for a run. Because good mental &amp; physical health is key.\n\nDownvote away and peace out brothers.",

        "selftext": "Alright so here\u2019s a brief rundown while I wait to hear back from u/WSBgod for permission to post more details.  For now, this is what I\u2019m sharing.  \n\nLet me start by saying that during the mania today, my position was that the whole thing was a hoax.  Many comments were focusing on how options prices were nicely rounded 100.00 and shit like that.  While I didn\u2019t have time to really dive into those details, I was skeptical simply because he claimed to go from $4 million to $8 million.  Nicely doubling your bet is not something you typically do with options, that\u2019s what you do with roulette when betting on black.  It was just too clean.  Of course, it was also very lucky and extremely ballsy\u2014neither of which is uncommon on WSB.\n\nNevertheless, [I took the post down](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f006zu/wsbgod_post_removed_pending_indisputable_proof/) until there was indisputable proof.  Behind the scenes, this was roughly the exchange in modmail with timestamps.\n\n***\n\nHere's the timeline (all in central time)\n\n&gt;1:55pm u/ITradeBaconFutures stickies a comment on mega thread saying [\"Proof or ban\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezwbve/reports_of_my_death_have_been_greatly_exaggerated/fgq6q81/)\n\n&gt;3:32pm u/WSBgod messages mods and asks \"What do you recommend?\"\n\n&gt;3:34pm I reply \"idk but it better be good. I'm recommending a screen sharing session\"\n\n&gt;4:28pm u/WSBgod replies \"I'm happy to verify, have nothing to hide and my post history is the best evidence a person could ask for. But I won't do anything that reveals personal information, login credentials, or anything that could be used against me.\"\n\n&gt;4:53pm \"This should be all the evidence you need:\n\n&gt;&lt;link to imgur with his account summary&gt;\n\n&gt;PLEASE do not share this or pass it around and make me regret doing your verification. I know you need to verify to keep BSers off here, but please keep my privacy in mind. Thank you.\"\n\nThe picture was a screenshot of his account summary from his broker with many trades, including tesla\n\n&gt;4:55pm \"Not good enough sorry.\"\n\nThen there was bickering back and forth about what standard of proof meant, and what we could do about it until u/WSBgod capitulated.\n\nAt 5:18pm He accepted the screenshare which we did shortly after.\n\n***\n\nWe went on discord and he shared his screen, where he had a chrome window up with a couple of tabs open to vanguard, one of which was logged in and had a clearly visible **SSL** icon to the left of the address.  He scrolled around (without hitting the top of the screen where his name/account would show).  Once he was done showing me the numbers, I asked him to refresh the page.  He then took the discord window and carefully placed it such that it covered only the contents of the website to hide his name from showing up after the refresh.   The \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d was small enough so that I could see the address bar at all times, and most of the contents of the webpage.  There was no keyboard shortcuts\u2014everything was done by mouse.  He clicked the refresh button, and after a visible refresh of the site, he moved the \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d and showed me that all the numbers remained the same.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019ve taken the video and edited it such that it removes all personal information, but I can\u2019t in good conscience publish it without his consent.  Doing so would eliminate the possibility of anybody ever trusting me (or the mods) with any sort of proof again, and for that reason I will wait and hope to get permission to post it.  Otherwise this is the extent of what I\u2019m sharing.\n\nSo the question remains, could this be fake? Absofuckinglutely.  Could he fake the url, website, broker summary, ssl certificates and inspect/refresh? Yes.  Of course it can be faked.  For all the retard talk that\u2019s thrown around, you all are actually really fucking capable (you\u2019ve proved it time and time again).  I\u2019m not saying that u/WSBgod\u2019s claims are irrefutable, I\u2019m just laying out the proof he gave me.\n\nWhen people make huge ass claims, as mods, the best we can do is ask for \u201cproof.\u201d  Short of asking for his username and password, this was the closest thing that I could think of and I gave him a very short window of time.  Never in the history of WSB have I ever asked to log into somebody\u2019s computer to see their screen. There\u2019s no precedent for that and there\u2019s no reason for him to have anticipated that.  u/fscomeau faked a video but he filmed, edited it on his own time and uploaded it to youtube.  In today\u2019s case, I gave u/WSBgod less than 2 hours to let me on his computer and he did exactly what I asked him to do once I was watching his screen.  As a mod, that is as much proof as I can reasonably ask somebody to give me.  And as a mod, I'm sharing it with you.  If there\u2019s a better method of proof, I\u2019m open to ideas.  If he faked it, then congrats to him for doing a good job at faking and anticipating my response when asking for proof.  And if he made money then congrats to him for scoring big.\n\nThe last note I\u2019ll share is his account balance **did not show $8 million dollars**.  The total balance was slightly less, but it was pretty damn close.  \n\nI\u2019ll let you decide for yourselves based on this information and I hope to be able to post the video soon.",

Usually a pull back follows the 3rd day but what makes this tricky is there is big news coming this week and next. \n\nWhat\u2019s less obvious is my move. Do I sell all and go puts? Do I sell some and hedge with puts? Do I let it ride because I\u2019m all in leaps and my thesis still holds - 50 this year, aka 10B market cap minimum. I\u2019m leaning towards letting it ride. Then again, this is life changing loot. IV is in the stratosphere. \n\nAlso, please don\u2019t dm me asking my opinion on your moves. Just read my posts and you\u2019ll know what I\u2019ve done and what I\u2019m thinking. \n\nListen, by the time I post this it may be up even further. Hard to keep up with this rocket ship. Needless to say, I\u2019m feeling blessed, grateful and humbled by this move and my good fortune to have been in for the ride. Peace and love to all.

Paid my other loan shark back his 14k so now that that's taken care of my only debts are to this guy for 100k (20% interest due end of every month starting in March). \n\nHave around 70k in cash right now. Going to see my brother on Sunday to see if he will write me a cheque for it so I can deposit it in the bank and then fund my trading account by Tuesday-ish. \n\nIf not, just going to deposit the cash and say that I got it from a friend as a loan.

This kind of low quality post and misinformation should not be allowed on this sub. We didn't come here to read misinformation, or make posts that belong on /r/wallstreetbets. We didn't come here to look at memes or \"get rich\" schemes. We came here for high quality discussions on investing.\n\nI am really sad that this sub has started to turn into /r/wallstreetbets. I actually hate to say this, but the quality of this sub has declined so much that I sometimes find more useful advise on /r/wsb. \n\nMods, this is not an attack on the hard work you do, but we really need much stronger moderation in this sub. It is not about limiting free speech. It is about maintaining the integrity and quality of the sub.\n\nMore concretely, comments that are borderline low quality can be downvoted by the sub, comments that obviously fall below a certain quality bar should be removed via moderation, and egregiously low quality comments like above should result in temporary banning of the member.",

        "selftext": "I think because of the great recession in '08, when people hear about a coming 'recession' they think it will basically be a collapse like the last time. In reality, a recession is literally just 2 consecutive quarters of GDP growth.\n\nNow since we have to assume bull markets and awesome economies can't last forever, *something* will eventually have to cause a recession. Often times, such as the great recession and great depression, it's caused by unmitigated greed and delusion. Then delusional euphoria for 'no reason' followed by people shutting down (financially) because of fear. Things are great and then all of a sudden things collapse when delusion reaches a maximum. In this case, it's a self fulfilling prophecy.  When confidence returns, and all the nonsensical businesses are purged, things can return.\n\n**BUT**, say we get a recession because of this virus. Would that even be surprise at all? Obviously people are going to not want to go outside, or buy a new car for a trip they no longer want to go on, and suddenly people are more concerned with staying healthy than having the latest new dumb gadget or fancy clothes. It's a recession that has a **reason**. \n\nAnd I think it will be a lot easier to swallow for the general public. Like, \"of course we had a recession, no one was buying anything because of the virus!\" But once things cool off\n\nBut I'd argue the result is the same. The crappy unnecessary businesses and products will fail, and the higher quality stuff remains. But once things cool down, like if we get a vaccine after a year, it's possible we'll come out of the other end with the benefits of having the fat cut, but way less uncertainty, and dare I say optimism. There will be a light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.\n\nI don't know if I really have a point, I was just wondering what thoughts everyone else had and it might make a good discussion.",

        "selftext": "So first of I'm a german, and I've been a perma bull up until today.\n\nThe first 16 infections with the coronavirus Germany had were all people that worked at \"Webasto\", a car part supplier from bavaria. These infections happened because a woman from china came to webasto to take part in a seminar. Webasto even closed their Headquarters and people that came in contact with infected people were closely monitored and had to stay at home. This way there weren't any new infections.\n\nNow we got an issue tho. First there was a new infection in Baden-Wuerttemberg that was related to the infections in Italy. But even worse, yesterday we got headlines that a new infection in North Rhine-Westphalia (A state in germany that isn't close to bavaria or the company Webasto) was diagnosed and the person is being treated in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nSo what's the big deal? Well this last week we had carnival in Germany. People who know carnival know it's fucking wild. A ton of drunk people partying and dancing together, hugging, making out whatever, you get the deal, it's basically the perfect place to infect a billion people in 3 seconds. And the guy I just talked about? Well, he reportedly took place in carnival celebrations... oh and by the way his wife works as a Kindergartener.\nLike 30 minutes ago the news were saying there are five new cases, now there are apparently 7 and it's unclear how many people might walk around infected without noticing.\n\nTo top it off our health minister Jens Spahn just said that we're at the beginning of an epidemic in Germany.\n\nI think Germany might be fucked, not sure yet... but potentially pretty fucked. And I know people said nobody cares about italy when somebody said \"GuYs ItS rEaLlY bAd In ItAlY\". But I do feel like germany might have a bigger influence on the global economy than Italy. \n\nTL;DR: Some dude went partying to celebrate carnival without knowing he had the coronavirus. Germanys coronavirus infections might potentially skyrocket over the next couple of days.",

At all. And at the risk of sounding alarmist, I am going to put my neck out there and say that this thing is the inevitable shock that always seems to kick off a recession. With that said, it's going to take a little bit of time before markets digest the supply shocks that are going to come through from China's shutdown. And past that point, I really don't think anybody is pricing in the fact that this is going to start to mandate shutdowns elsewhere. \n\nThe funny thing, is that from a data perspective, we actually were starting to get a mild recovery in the macro regime, suggesting the Fed may have actually engineered a sort of soft landing, at least for a short bit. Given, that soft landing would be heavily stimulus and debt fueled, but, the means don't matter in the short term.  But this item is coming at a very very very bad time, and the economy just is not prepared to handle this even slightly. The markets obviously are not reflecting this right now, but markets are not efficient, and there are a variety of reasons for this.\n\nI will say, we likely will see some sort of massive wave of additional stimulus, or at least an attempt at it. But the transmission mechanisms of getting said stimulus to the people who need it is going to cause this to falter when it's needed most.",

Needless to say after finding this community last week, I pulled some money from my personal savings that I was using to put towards fixing up my basement a bit to try to invest and get some extra capital to help out back home. Worst case if I lost it all, it was for my basement, no big deal.\n\nI watched probably 30 hours of video around options, read nearly every discussion on here, and observed the discord for a while. I started trading around the Ally / AMD spam, was up 2k on my way to work and down 1700 by the time i got there.

        "selftext": "I see so many comments on here anytime the market drops like \"stocks are on sale\" or \"if you loved stocks last week, then you should love them even more this week,\" which seem to focus only on the price, without understanding what the price of a stock or the market consists of: future earnings expectations. \n\nJust because the price of a stock was X last week doesn't mean that price has any relevance to the price this week. And just because a stock rose 100% last year, doesn't mean that the stock is any more or less attractive today based on its past history, at least from a fundamental perspective. \n\nWhen you are only factoring in past prices (without analyzing new, forward-looking information) you are engaging in **anchoring,** a psychological concept that overweights initial information you are presented with. \n\nHere is a relatively concise analysis of the current market's outlook from Frank Curzio, who like every analyst, has had his hits and misses, but is usually quite bullish that actually displays analysis based on new information related to earnings. I would link, but this came from an email update.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAccording to Capital IQ, S&amp;P's research division, companies in the S&amp;P 500 are expected to generate a combined $181 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2020. That's 14% higher than the $159 in combined EPS the S&amp;P 500 generated in 2019.\u00a0\n\nNow that the coronavirus has spread... there's no way earnings are growing 14% this year. In fact, Goldman Sachs\u2014which once called the virus a \u201dshort-term problem\"\u2014just published a report saying earnings will not grow in 2020.\u00a0\n\nI think this is conservative, given the number of companies that have lowered earnings over the past two weeks (including Apple and Microsoft, two of the biggest names in the S&amp;P 500). But it's important that investors understand these numbers.\u00a0\n\nIf we see no earnings growth in 2020... that means 2020 earnings will come in at $159 a share, at most. But if we divide the current price of the S&amp;P 500 (about $3,050) by the $159 in combined earnings... we can see that **the S&amp;P 500 is** **already** **trading at 19x forward earnings.**\n\nIn other words, even though the market pulled back more than 10%... the S&amp;P 500 is still trading like there's no coronavirus. (Remember, earnings are falling alongside the markets... that's why the market is still expensive despite its 10% correction).\u00a0\n\nAt 19x forward earnings, the markets are still pricing in significant growth. Yet, earnings probably won't grow at all in 2020...\u00a0\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n**There's likely another 20% downside from here.**\n\nWith no actual growth forecast for 2020, the market should be trading closer to 15x\u2014the 10-year average... and more than 20% lower than current levels.\n\nOf course, this downside could be limited if we find a vaccine for the coronavirus in the short term... or if we see massive government intervention to help backstop the markets. (Things like lowering interest rates, preventing short selling, or injecting cash directly into the markets.)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo anytime someone says stocks are on sale, or cheap, or a good time to buy, you should ask them, \"what are you basing that information on?\" The fact that the price is cheaper than it was last week/month/year means nothing without understanding the earnings picture.",

        "selftext": "Yo fuckers, listen up!\n\nI see a lot of people just YOLO'ing their life savings on the next meme stock here. Yes, it's more fun than buying a lottery ticket and your chances of success are higher. Wait, are they?\n\nAs a physicist and mathematician, I feel the need to at least tell my fellow autists how to bet properly.\n\nThere's something called the [Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion), which tells you whether a bet is favorable or not. I'm not boring you with the details, so just read the article if you're smart. But at its core it's a really simple formula:\n\n    f* = p - q/b\n\n, where f\\* is the Kelly criterion, p is the probability of success, q is the probability of going tits up and b is the profit-risk-ratio.\n\nTrading software like TWS and many others give you the probability of success, when you create an order. So p and q are known. f\\* needs to be positive, the bigger the better. b is what we want to know.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n    p - q/b &gt; 1\n    p &gt; q/b\n    b &gt; q/p\n    b &gt; (1-p)/p , because q = 1-p\n    b &gt; 1/p - 1\n\nI wrote out every step, so even the biggest idiot can understand it. So if your probability of success is 70%, your profit-risk-ratio needs to be `1/70% - 1 = 42.9%`. That means if you risk $100, you need to potentially earn at least $43.\n\nBut those numbers are only interesting for the theta gang and them losers in r/investing.\n\nMy strong handed r/wallstreetbets friends, with balls made out of steel, need an example that better suits their need for the ultimate thrill.\n\nSo let's say you buy a call that is 20% OTM at 280% IV. For example a Feb'28 40c on $SPCE. The underlying is currently at $33 and the call costs $3.50.\n\nThis will give you a 27% chance of success, so the profit-risk-ratio needs to be `1/27% - 1 = 270%`. If you exit these trades at less profit than an average 270% on your investment, math clearly states that you'll definitely go tits up. \n\nIf you bought this Feb'28 40c on $SPCE for $350, you need to sell it for at least $947 (on average over all your trades). It's even a bit more, because of commissions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow listen, this is the optimal way of betting, but there's still a risk of going bankrupt. If you do an evolution on the Kelly bet, more than 90% of them diverge (go to infinity), but 10% still converge (go tits up). So people like Warren Buffet only do 20%-50% of the Kelly criterium.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you retards actually learned something.",

        "selftext": "In my city there's a big bank that offers trading courses with the idea that you will know what you're doing when you open a trading account with them. So far so good, as what I've been learning is mainly from shitposts on the internet and fundamentals in investor books have not been of much help making quick tendies which is just how I like them - what I do is pretty much the opposite as I'm getting richer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I sign up, start going, guy talking is professional but still you can tell he's not dead inside, pretty cool. He's talking about doing analysis, volatility, figures and so on. He's always repeating himself saying how important risk management is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe shows a graph tracking his first 10 months of trading when he started some years ago, he turned 2k into 180k.... and then to 1k in 2 trades. Of course I start laughing a little bit, thinking yeah well that's life, other people in the course are very concerned, they seem to be r/inv\\*sting kind of people. He says to never put more than 10% of your portfolio into 1 thing and not allow yourself to lose more than 2% in a trade. Emphasizes that we need to follow the current trend as it's likely to keep going but never go overboard and blah blah\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo later at one point he's once again saying how important it is to keep in mind some boring real numbers, people ask him about currency trading and he's explaining the boring figures. I ask him what he thinks of $TSLA, he stops for a moment and says that this is just some hype and not sustainable. Then another guy on the course asks how we should trade during the China virus, guy says basically that we should be extra careful. He implies Trump tweets have an important role in market movements. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen he says that if you're having any emotions while trading, you're doing it wrong. I feel personally attacked as trading has become a big source of entertainment, despair and anger, often all at the same time. Ask him how he's trading during a market that's at an all time high. He says he has sold all his positions rn because it's not sustainable and shit will hit the fan any moment now even though he admits it probably won't happen before the end of summer. Ask him why he's not making tendies until then, he says it's beyond his personal risk tolerance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what I learned is that I'm doing trading totally technically wrong but still making more tendies than this professional guy is. Turns out we are smarter even though perhaps more retarded than professional traders. Buy all the dips and market can't go down, stonks only go up. If you read this far you should know MSFT is boring, what the hell is that slow rise pffft, going 90% of portfolio in SPCE. Make money while you can and good luck bulls",

Past outbreaks over 20 years have seen SP 500 down from 6-13% (we are in the middle of that range)\n2. We see recovery fairly quickly historically- in months (exact data linked below)\n3. With points one and two in mind I would expect a little more pain though is possible because a) we have a hit to a manufacturing sector b) retail leverage and stock marker prices are at an all time high\n4. Media outlets only care about the \"dramatic\" - the will say \"worst drop ever\"  \"1,000 points\" etc. They will start to reference \"points\" vs percentage in headlines for the dramatic effect (a 1,000 point now is not as significant as a 1,000 drop a decade ago)\n5. Expect wild swings due to retail investors who never saw a drop and leverage being used - especially in the afternoons as people get margin called.  \n6. Dramatic increases in volume will also be a sign of a bottom (The Bottom) as people finally \"give up\" and go back to their fast good job\n7. The hit to China is UNDER estimated while the hit to the USA is OVER estimated.  We are not China. I spent a lot of time there... Friends and Family from China travel to the US for products and health care.  China has almost no healthcare and shit sanitation.  If they are not all dead the virus cannot be that bad.  The USA is one of the cleanest countries with the best hygiene. We consume most the worlds deodorant. Any thought of a germ freaks us out. We will be fine.\n8.

        "selftext": "I am by no means an expert or a veteran in this sport, but I have seen these sudden drops enough times to have learned something (mostly from personal experience).\n\n1. Take a breath and think rationally about what is happening right now that is causing the drop. Flu has been around since the dawn of men, and it's a consistent annual killer of about 50000 people around the world. Corona is just a type of flu that was given a name and some media attention. With a death toll of under 3000 so far and symptoms, infection rates and death rates similar to the \"regular\" flu, there is nothing special about it to warrant any kind of panic behavior. For comparison 500 000 people die of malaria annually. Do markets drop because of malaria?\n2. Figure out if the market is acting irrationally. Best indicator is if all the stocks are dropping at the same rate no matter the industry or the potential impact from the corona virus. is DAL going to be affected by the virus? Well people are going to be traveling less, so it's a safe bet that their revenue will drop. Will MSFT be infected by the virus at the same rate as DAL? A company selling PC software and cloud platforms? Probably not. Then why are they dropping at the same rate? IRRATIONAL MARKET\n3. Don't be a part of the herd. The market is moved by the average of all trading activity. An average investor is just that - average. Be better than average. Look at what the best of the best (buffet, icahn) are doing. Are they panic selling? No\n4. NEVER PANIC SELL! Are you invested in quality companies that you can see being healthy in 10 years? Then why would you sell now?? Take any of those companies and look at their stock price for the past 10 years. Did they go through dips of 20% or more? Most likely yes. Imagine the people that sold back then. Fools, right? If you sell now, you will probably end up reentering the position at a higher price when you figure out \"thing are going back to normal\"\n5. Don't short stocks. Are you a professional trader looking to squeeze every cent out of the market? No? Then NEVER SHORT STOCKS! It's simple math. Max potential gain of an unleveraged stock short is 100% (if the stock goes to 0 - highly unlikely!). Potential loss is unlimited (because the stock can go up indefinitely). Even the best of the best have lost fortunes on shorting (famous bill ackman herbalife short)\n6. If you have the cash - buy the dips, if not - hold. The virus will fade, markets will rebound. They always do. Worse things have happened. World wars, debt crises... Markets always rebound.\n7. Don't look at your portfolio every 5 minutes and don't try to time the bottom. It's just bad for mental health.",

If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSo, now you get the picture, that every day **at the open lately, folks are grabbing call options quickly and driving the stocks/indexes higher,\u201d** writes Scott Murray of Volatility Analytics. \u201cIt is much easier for this kind of market to be unhinged, as long call holders\u2019 corresponding dealer position is long the underlying.\u201d\n\nSo /r/wsb thinks it discovered the holy grail, because it learned that sellers of options hedge their delta. \n\nu/SuXs, managed to distinguish himself from the imbecile masses of the subreddit, by appearing to truly believe that if he manages to convince some people to buy $200 MSFT calls, the dealers will buy enough shares to offset their delta to make a $1tn stock rally. \n\nJust check out his recent submission history - reads like a strong CV for a position of a full retard: [https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png](https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png) \n\nNews flash - delta hedging becomes a factor when a stock goes up 20% in a day. Or 100% in a month.  Not when you place a $100k (let's be generous) order for $200 MSFT calls. Also, while TSLA can conceivably go to $1000 or $1200 or $700 over the next week, those kinds of moves are not in cards for MSFT - hence even less need to aggressively delta hedge.\n\nMSFT is a solid company. But today, I sincerely hope it totally shits the bed or else you dumb motherfuckers will really believe that by having 20 guys spend $300 each on an OTM call you can make the share price of a $1tn company go up.\n\nBTW buying OTM calls at the open has nothing to do with HFT spoofing of orders that Navinder Sarao got busted for. That guy was just flashing a huge order on the bid side to move the market marginally up (and opposite for ask side). He never intended for those orders to be filled, so he was quickly cancelling them after getting the desired effect.\n\nSometimes you make me ashamed to be part of this subreddit.\n\ntl;dr; the post is not about advocating selling of MSFT (I have no view on the stock), the title is a clickbait.",

Long-term thinking has been rewarded in the past and unless you think the world or innovation is coming to an end it should be rewarded in the future. As Winston Churchill once said, \u201cI am an optimist.  It does not seem too much use being anything else.\u201d\n\n\n\nLosses are part of the deal when investing in stocks.  How you react to those losses is one of the biggest determinants of your investment performance.\n\n\n\nSaving more, thinking long-term and allowing compound interest to work in your favor are your biggest accelerants for building wealth. These factors have nothing to do with picking stocks or a complex investment strategy. Get these big things right and any disciplined investment strategy should do the trick.",

        "selftext": "Let's break it down based on some research I did while the market was closed yesterday:\n\nLet\u2019s look at profitability: with a current Operating Margin for Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\] sitting at +33.96 and its Gross Margin at +65.81, this company\u2019s Net Margin is now 31.70%. These measurements indicate that Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\] is generating considerably more profit, after expenses are accounted for, compared to its market peers.\n\nThis company\u2019s Return on Total Capital is 23.74, and its Return on Invested Capital has reached 19.90%. Its Return on Equity is 42.41, and its Return on Assets is 14.39. These metrics all suggest that Microsoft Corporation is doing well at using the money it earns to generate returns.\n\nTurning to investigate this organization\u2019s capital structure, Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\] has generated a Total Debt to Total Equity ratio of 84.49. Similarly, its Total Debt to Total Capital is 42.52, while its Total Debt to Total Assets stands at 30.17. Looking toward the future, this publicly-traded company\u2019s Long-Term Debt to Equity is 15.87, and its Long-Term Debt to Total Capital is 77.31.\n\nYou're not still reading this, you're commenting something about \"TL:DR which strike\" and I actually copied the above paragraphs from an outdated article. This is not real DD and while I'm sure 90% of you have stopped reading -- oh who am I kidding, 99% of you have stopped reading up until this point that literally nothing I type here matters. \n\nThe only substantial point you should take away from this is you need to buy MSFT calls and pump up the price this week because while my calls are expiring in April, I have no intention whatsoever in letting Theta trap me in losses until then and I really need to get out of this position to make money in other places this week and next. Okay, back to the con.\n\nShares of Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\], overall, appear to be a solid investment option, with Wall Street analysts expecting its price to rise considerably in the next 12 months. This company generates high value from the labor resources and other capital it has available, and while it has heavy Long-Term Debt to Equity, the majority of the metrics point to this investment being highly attractive. \n\n**As you can see, it's the perfect time to buy MSFT calls.**",

They\u2019re the market leader in diabetes monitoring technology. They monitor your blood sugar levels via non-invasive techniques (basically no needles or blood involved) and you can track your blood sugar anytime, anywhere through your phone or smart watch. Pretty revolution stuff, they\u2019re first to do it too. If you\u2019re blood sugar is outta wack it notifies you so you can get your insulin pump and get it back to normal.\n\nNot convinced yet? Well here\u2019s the low. I\u2019m a med student, I\u2019ve seen patients with diabetes, every type 1 diabetic patient is buying one of these monitoring kits if they haven\u2019t already. Hell even Karens are buying them for their kids just to make sure their precious angel\u2019s blood sugar are in normal range.\n\nThe number of diabetics is only increasing, so the market for this monitoring device is only gonna go up with it. What\u2019s better is these will be life long customers since the disease can\u2019t be cured. This is reflected on the stock, up 12% in the last day, 18% last week, 21% last month, 40% in the last 3 months.\n\nSo what the fuck are you fucking autists waiting for? Get your sugar rush now and get some god damn calls. The more people buying this stock, the more publicity this stock gets, the more people with diabetes hear about it and buy it.

If you were scared a week ago, then fine. I would understand that. Let me show you autists some numbers to show you what I am talking about here.\n\nAt the beginning of february, the average amount of new confirmed cases was around \\~3000 per day. This was also at a time where we did not really know the recovery rates yet, and the KD ratio of Coronavirus was 3 recovered, 1 died. The recovery rate was at about 200 per day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo at the beginning of february we have 3k per day getting sick, and 200 per day getting healthy, with a KDA of 3 to 1. And you autists are out there wearing your party hats and doing cocaine off of strippers bootycheeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that was 20 days ago so let's look at what has been happening with the coronavirus now! \n\nThe KDA of Coronavirus has dropped down to 21,2k recovered vs 2,3k deaths, which would make the coronavirus kicked out of any halo lobby. The daily increase of sick people has been sinking from a high of 2k to a low of 400, orbiting around an average of \\~700. The amount of recoveries are at this time outpacing the amount of newly infected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats why I say, if you were worried about this virus one or two weeks ago, I would totally understand BUT what is actually happening is that this virus is turning out to be not so bad after all (just like all the viruses end up, basically)..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease give me your autistic viewpoint of this if you are a market trader who is alpha like me. Here you can see the numbers on your own neatly displayed\n\n[http://gisandata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR0-DnNscnz4bJm6GPmq5q1NWBjBEapwHKt-s6H3OiEzgMSRzf5G9jtqwik#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](http://gisandata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR0-DnNscnz4bJm6GPmq5q1NWBjBEapwHKt-s6H3OiEzgMSRzf5G9jtqwik#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short: Bull gang bull gang bull gang, spent 3 rax on calls man, my bitch love do cocaine",

        "selftext": "Whew. I am shaking typing this. I tried to look for posting rules or suggestions, and honestly I might not be in the right spot for this particular question. Five years ago I met a man and we had a whirlwind romance. He\u2019s always been a gambler. That was his reputation among everyone before I even met him. I was the last to know. Shooting dice, cards, sports bets, going to the casino, stock trading you name it. We lived together, he worked hard to get away from everyone he knew who did that stuff, got himself into GA, and gave me all the money. \n\nFast forward. Now I\u2019m back home with my parents raising our 2 1/2 year-old and our six month old alone. We lost everything. He emptied out every account, would pretend that he was going to self exclude by having me handle everything, and then get pretty upset or find a way to get around me. He emptied out everything. \n\nI work two jobs now to pay for everything for the kids. He doesn\u2019t contribute at all. Since last year began, he has seen his children once. He doesn\u2019t contribute money, and I speak to his mother and sister who tell me that despite him coming home around 6AM to sleep, he wakes up, goes to work (Cash job, paid daily), and that\u2019s his routine. \n\nStarting last year he's been emptying his account into Robinhood. In the beginning he was very proud of his trades and showed me his profits. I was happy and we were happy, he treated me well and bought me expensive bags. But recently he went all in on one trade and lost everything.\n\nI speak to him. It\u2019s the usual stuff. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I hate myself. I\u2019m going to ban myself in the casinos. I\u2019m going to get back into the program. I\u2019m going to give you all the money every night.\u201d He even shares his location with me through iPhone (his suggestion) in a stunt to give me some reassurance (phone turns off every night at 3AM and comes back on when he\u2019s out of money). We sat down last year and had a super long super emotional talk when I told him that it\u2019s not even his sickness it hurts me so much- I\u2019ve been with him and seen him though it for what feels like forever and I understand it\u2019s very deeply rooted. What kills me is that he lies to me and excludes me when he gets the itch. It feels like I\u2019m being stabbed in the back. He loves our kids and he loves me. But when he gets on these streaks, and he\u2019s asking me for money for gas to get to work, and he\u2019s missing the kids growing up... I feel scared for the future. How long do I keep trying? What happens when he keeps emptying the accounts and I\u2019ve got two mouths to feed? I am posting here for advice. \n\nDo I give up? Is there hope? I still love him so much. I\u2019ve lost good friends to heroin, I\u2019ve seen so many addictions in my life. This is the most intense and recurring thing I\u2019ve ever dealt with. I just wanted to ask you guys who have experience and have the mind to truly understand what he is thinking and why this is happening, and if there\u2019s a way to be a family? Or do I walk? Thank you. I\u2019m sorry to be such a lame bummer",

        "selftext": "Since it's a holiday and we're all bored anyway I'm going to give you some *very* basic things to think about before you open a position. Who am I? I'm just a random dude with some business and finance education. I have had limited success and failures (over the past two years I've been up 90% and down 60%), but the key is that I *haven't cashed out of the game yet*. So, if you're looking for ways to justify your gambling addiction, read on. If you want to be the one retard who learns something today and not the 9 retards posting stupid shit in the comments, read on.\n\nToday I've picked a nice mix of glaring WSB faults and interesting things:\n\n1. Risk and reward expectations\n2. Stock and Options packages (ETFs and multilegs)\n3. Research aka Due diligence (DD)\n\nLet's dive in friendos!\n\n**Risk and reward expectations** \\- Generally investment managers, financiers, and traders gauge their performance for a quarter or year based on how they did **relative to the market**. So if the S&amp;P 500 only grows 6% in a year, a trader is successful if they made 9% gain that year. If the S%P 500 grows 20% like in 2019, you could literally just park your money in stocks and sell a year later for 20% gain, no skill involved. **Historically, the market has grown 10%** ***a year.*** I mention this in bold because most newcomers here really need to have their risk/reward expectations reframed. Usually the rewards are directly related to the risk that you lose everything. Doubling your money with a yolo call position is *incredibly risky and you are likely to lose all of your money*. This isn't a bear/bull thing (which is fucking stupid anyway. Imagine gambling/investing based on a fucking animal mascot). Pouring your money into shares of an S&amp;P 500 index is much more safe and likely to preserve your money. I think there is a big contingent of big brained smarties on this board who want much more risk and reward than buying shares, but don't want to fuck in the dark on WSB meme options. If you are ok making 5-10% a week instead of 5-10% a year, read on.\n\n**Stock and options packages** \\- Stocks get packaged up by companies and resold to you in two ways: mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are pretty much the same thing - a bundle of stocks that you buy into - except ETFs are... exchange-traded aka sold as shares. Why do companies do this? To hedge against the risk we talked about before!\n\nWe need to digress for a second into different kinds of risk. If you had 0 toleration for risk, if you wanted a virtual guarantee of not losing money, how can you invest? You can buy **US Treasury bonds.** The rate of return on US treasury bonds is literally called *the risk-free rate* in finance and is about 1.6%/year or something right now. Pitiful. In our desire to see bigger returns *we must take on bigger risks.* There is **firm specific risk** related to the operations and financing of a specific firm ($BABA, $MSFT, $ADI). Let's say we didn't want to deal with this risk. We just want to take advantage of their growth of an industry, sector, or the market as a whole, without getting burned by the mistakes of any one individual firm. Then we can *diversify away* *firm-specific risk* and deal only with **market risk** by purchasing shares of every company in an industry, sector, or market. So State Street Global Advisors purchases a weighted average of the S&amp;P 500 and sells that package to you as $SPY. Any one success or failure in the S&amp;P 500 doesn't make SPY move much; it moves the way the market moves in general.\n\nOk, so, there are indexes/ETFs for everything. Whole market, biotech, manufacturing, industrial power, you name it. These are incredibly successful products - $SPY, $TQQQ, $PEY - because they are less risky and move slower than the individual stocks in the funds. What's the deal with options packages? **Options packages hedge risk in exchange for lower returns and are available on Robinhood (but never take the pre-built offered packages)**. Take a second at this point to go to investopedia and get a handle on spreads - you'll see things like Bull/Bear Put/Call credit/debit spread.\n\nSo let's say you have a belief that $MSFT is going up, but you don't want to *risk* everything on straight calls that could expire worthless in a week. You have some *options* (pun intended). You can reduce your risk by changing the rules - open a *bull put (credit) spread* so that you don't need $MSFT to go up, you just need it to not go down. Or you can lower the cost of your calls (and the reward) by opening a *bull call (debit) spread.* What I love about these is that the only cost/collateral RH requires is that difference between strikes in a spread. For instance, I have a SPY bull put spread right now with strikes at 330 and 329 - RH required $100 in collateral and gave me 12 dollars credit when I opened it (the difference between selling to open the 330 put and buying to open the 329 put), and I think I can close it out this week for a cost of 5 dollars, netting me 7$ on my 100. That doesn't sound flashy except that *7% a week is literally rich people insaneo gains on a relatively safe bet.* If you've read this far, my secret volatility play this week is opening a condor tomorrow on $ADI and closing it after earnings. EPS is estimated to be pretty low, but the firm's operating cycle is absolutely solid, so I think it'll move sideways on the news and we're going to make money on the IV crush. $1 spreads on the low and high ends, with strikes roughly 6% out of the money. Open it for 30 bucks credit tomorrow, close it for 15 bucks debit on Thursday.\n\n**Due Diligence** \\- DD is more art than science, and it's going to look different for stocks than for options, but in either case often the only difference between sweating nervously for a week while you look for a way to not lose so much, and relaxing confidently in your purchase, is 15 minutes of research. **The price of a share is related to the performance of the firm, even in 2020.** If you're trying to do DD on a specific firm as an amatuer, you want to look at 3 things - Quarterly/annual reports of earnings, analyst opinions, and the sector as a whole. Let's take $MSFT for example: Big revenue growth each year for the past decade, analysts say that Azure and Teams are solid products, and the tech sector is growing, so there's room for $MSFT to go up without having to take market share from competitors. That info took me 5 minutes to find, and with it I'm very confident that purchasing shares of $MSFT is a good idea. You can usually go to a company's website to find their financial information in a government tax filing form called a 10-k, but that can be pretty dense. You're looking for a page called the Balance Sheet.\n\nAnyway, hope you had a good read and learned something. If not, fuck off and lose all your money and disappear unnoticed in a few weeks like 99% of the people on this board.",

To see the previous month  [https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/eik3l5/life\\_after\\_fire\\_december\\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/eik3l5/life_after_fire_december_update/) \n\nto see this month's real estate specific post [https://www.reddit.com/r/RentalInvesting/comments/exefp1/january\\_rental\\_business\\_numbers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RentalInvesting/comments/exefp1/january_rental_business_numbers/)\n\nI officially retired somewhere between 2011 and 2013. The time is not specific because I fazed out my previous business and was still handling my real estate management myself...so if you count from the time I hired a full time property manager and was completely finished will all previous businesses it would be later date. If your definition is more lenient, then it would be the earlier date.\n\nOkay, now for the numbers.\n\nMy net real estate income from existing rentals for the month was $9,243 . (The low number this month is because I had to repair 4 AC units that were damaged in a lightening strike... in addition to the usual minor repairs and property management expenses) If you are interested in the full details of the business numbers, please see the real estate specific update from the link above..\n\nEstimated real estate portfolio value $1.35M This is an increase of $30K over last month.\n\nTotal Acquisition Costs of real estate (including initial renovations) $418,000\n\nMy total investments/cash outside of real estate totaled $266,096 This is a combination of stock, Fundrise, money market, and cash. This is an increase of $1,549 over last month.\n\nMy personal spending was $800 (everything not business related)...details can be seen at my post on [r/Frugal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/eiji4c/december\\_spending\\_breakdown\\_how\\_i\\_live\\_on\\_800\\_per/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/eiji4c/december_spending_breakdown_how_i_live_on_800_per/)\n\n As always, feel free to ask any questions!\n\nFor those interested in my yearly numbers of income and spending, I made about $125K net in 2019 from the rentals (haven't finished taxes, so this is an estimate), my investments outside of the rental business made about $50K (all of that was reinvested) and my personal spending was about $10K.",

        "selftext": "Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.\n\nFounded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988.\n\nWith an average net return of 39.1% after fees.\n\nThe Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.\n\nSince, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.\n\nNow, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).\n\nMedallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.\n\nNotice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.\n\nIn 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%\n\n**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.\n\nThat certainly beats inflation...\n\nSo, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?\n\n**PART 1: The Early Stages**\n\nEarly on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.\n\nRemember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,\u201d Simons said. \u201cA pure system without humans interfering.\u201d\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus\u2019 was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&amp;P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator\u2019s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman\u2019s calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\n\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\n\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\n\nThe mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**\n\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**",

        "selftext": "**$GILD** is set to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. Ride the Coronavirus fear\n\nYesterday,  [u/condensedOJ](https://www.reddit.com/user/condensedOJ/) made a post arguing to buy $GILD for 2/27 Market Open. I made the argument that $GILD was overbought and was likely to crash soon, and our time to buy would be within the next 2 weeks as the market calmed down from Coronavirus fears.\n\nIMPORTANT DEETS:\n\n1. $GILD leading coronavirus treatment progress overall. (Remdesivir) [https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/investing/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-who-remdesivir/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/investing/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-who-remdesivir/index.html)   \n**\"There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that's remdesivir,\"** Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said at a press conference in Beijing.\n2. $GILD has been testing the vaccine/treatment in China and are on PHASE 3 already. They've been hyped over Phase 1 trial news in the US so far. Every Phase they pass will be a huge $$$ boost  \n[https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/2/gilead-sciences-initiates-two-phase-3-studies-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/2/gilead-sciences-initiates-two-phase-3-studies-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19)\n3. \\*\\*\\*\\*Most other overhyped companies are just starting PHASE 1, and they havent even passed it yet.\n\nNow check the graph below. Top to bottom we have 3 indicators for the last 5 days. For those in need of a refresher, we're looking at Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index, and the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63o7zzjsjkj41.png?width=1915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=811e6ec95bca9e3faa1693a3c73d8c53edf9e16e\n\nTogether, this confirms some previous beliefs, and establishes the basis for several more conclusions. \n\n1.  Prior to market open on 2/27, we see from the RSI that the security is likely to be overbought with an RSI \\~70, indicating that we should prepare for a return to \\~RSI 50 (our equilibrium).\n2. At 2/27 Market Open, Investors scramble to buy $GILD and the price skyrockets, bringing us to the next indicator we will analyze, being the Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands show the 2 standard deviations above 2 below the SMA. We see that the Bollinger Band breakthrough causes Wall St Algorithmic Trading bots to instantly sell, driving price down and further triggering private trading bots to instantly sell and secure % gains. Thus, the hype finally crashes due to OVERhype and botting reaction to it. (70% of trading in US is algorithmic, you are not just playing with people, but also machines)\n3. WSB users still autistic and bought high and going to sell low on 2/27.\n\n\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\n\nHOWEVER, this provides us with the opportunity now to buy in on 2/28 to prepare for the weekend as the evidence below will show.\n\n1. Look at the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator. We see over the last 5 days, there has been a gradual increase of people BUYING $GILD. The indicator is as it sounds. It's cumulative, meaning that a rise means more people are buying, and a fall means more people are selling. \n2. This overall uptrend of the Accum/Dist Indicator gives us the confidence to BUY IN. But we need to get the timing right to avoid the Autistic \u2122  fall of those following [u/condensedOJ](https://www.reddit.com/user/condensedOJ/) yesterday (probably seeing a 30% fall in put premiums after they purchased at market open AKA losing 1/3 their money in 10 minutes). \n3. Now follow the RSI line and note how it falls to \\~40. This in combination with the Bollinger Bands beginning to tighten and the $GILD price evening out indicates to us that a short squeeze may be imminent (with prices shooting up likely Monday or Tuesday). \n\nPREDICTIONS:\n\n1. FRIDAY 2/28 $GILD goes up from Market Open and if you buy Calls, you'll be winning right out the gates.\n2. If $GILD goes down after Market Open but you bought Calls already, you'll temporarily be losing money. HOWEVER, after the weekend, with the buildup of coronavirus news, California potential OUTBREAK, and DJIA going down, $GILD will be set to skyrocket anyways and you'll be rolling in the tendies \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\nTLDR;\n\nBuy $GILD $80-$90 Calls for 3/20 - 4/17. If you're rich, or just \ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08 then buy them out further at higher premium. \n\n**$GILD $85 Call 3/20 or 4/27** to the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don\u2019t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.\n\nChina today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).\n\nChinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&amp;name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that\u2019s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.\n\nIn December 2019, a Moody\u2019s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China\u2019s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.\n\nThis was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering \u201chigh yield products\u201d to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, \u201cbecause the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.\u201d This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.\n\nThis is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron\u2019s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:\n\n&gt;One area, in particular, is back at the forefront\u2014local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities\u2014China\u2019s top two schools\u2014found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.\n\n&gt;Put another way, 85% of China\u2019s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.\n\n[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China\u2019s exposure to the world economy. I\u2019m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:\n\n&gt;In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China\u2019s] total GDP growth.\n\n&gt;In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.\n\nWhile 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&amp;P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don\u2019t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon\u2019s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.\n\nAll of this comes on top of Boeing\u2019s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China\u2019s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. \n\nIn addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.\n\nTo summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing\u2019s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.\n\nTL;DR: China\u2019s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing\u2019s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.",

Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on two companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0obj5ffxyh41.png?width=2338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb986fbced13dc0118b0af6ae24c209004810c6\n\nGlobal Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US and for IBM (and those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes not for consumers). They mostly focus on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the worlds largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earning on April 16th and option prices are ripe. Go get them tendies boiz.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks expected to rise even as virus creates volatility: \u2018The market thinks the worst is over\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/stocks-expected-to-rise-even-as-virus-creates-volatility-the-market-thinks-the-worst-is-over.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to remain hostage to developments involving the coronavirus in the week ahead, and even so, the market could continue to hit new highs.\n*****\n&gt; Economists have been reducing China\u2019s growth outlook for the quarter, with some seeing little or no growth and then a bounce back in the high single digits next quarter. The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there\u2019s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can\u2019t believe what\u2019s coming out of China.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. \u201cThe market didn\u2019t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There\u2019s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday\u2019s Empire State and Thursday\u2019s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n*****\n&gt; # Profit warnings\n&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains\u201d and exporters, said Keon. \u201cIt will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn\u2019t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,\u201d Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.\n*****\n&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.\n*****\n&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. \u201cCould we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. \u201cIt trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,\u201d he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.\n*****\n&gt; # Resilient market\n&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there\u2019s more clarity on the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we\u2019re there,\u201d said Sluymer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a year-end target but I think it\u2019s higher. I think we\u2019re in a sloppy range. I think it\u2019s range bound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. \u201cStocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he\u2019s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year. But that\u2019s the way we have our portfolios positioned \u2014 the market will work its way higher this year,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGXae0P.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZsVPAZO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DE2dIMR.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/iGBF28x.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rMe9946.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ps9FL8g.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C48fTcF.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lJgq8up.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKn6MfJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/A3rPbpC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QLBnp9J.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SfzBNHl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 12 of Last 14\n\n&gt; February\u2019s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 26 years with an average loss of 0.20% for S&amp;P 500.

DJIA and NASDAQ have similar patterns over the same timeframe.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72543f9b28ca268bee1f7dde79af6759/d9f94c53e26f1367-0f/s500x750/53f9e9a38b23b8c2481554e6f56238283009fb98.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1af227b4449cde52fe1100be5cc8fff2/d9f94c53e26f1367-84/s500x750/1701058d1cd50c8f1568e98537f0bb69053f45be.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8da900c074796667d88849ff6e47c46/d9f94c53e26f1367-32/s500x750/7449549dcd57b5281333fdd73c9066b813280fa1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Trading After Presidents\u2019 Day Weekend Still Weak\n\n&gt; Yesterday\u2019s post, showed improvement the two days before Presidents\u2019 Day Weekend the past 10 years. But the two days after still display a lot of red.

But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.\n\n&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn\u2019t be a total surprise? \u201cYes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.\u201d In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October\u2019s gain of 2.29%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/february-is-usually-weak-but-has-been-the-best-month-the-past-10-years.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Record Pace of Records\n\n&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap\n\n&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.\n\n&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**\n\n&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/China-Percent.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Things Are Looking Up\n\n&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.\n\n&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER\n&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren\u2019t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.\n\n&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don\u2019t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n\n&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS\n&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/WMC_02102020_1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another \"Delay\" in the Value Trade\n\n&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of \"The time for value stocks to outperform is now.\" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**\n\n&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.\n\n&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.\n\n&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 14th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.16.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP2aL-EGRQg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$ENPH** \n&gt; * **$INMD** \n&gt; * **$TRU** \n&gt; * **$WAB** \n&gt; * **$AEIS** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$BHC** \n&gt; * **$VMC** \n&gt; * **$GRMN** \n&gt; * **$LDOS** \n&gt; * **$TSEM** \n&gt; * **$ECL** \n&gt; * **$ALLE** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$OLED** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$NXRT** \n&gt; * **$BLMN** \n&gt; * **$ATH** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$FANG** \n&gt; * **$CEQP** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$FLR** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$VG** \n&gt; * **$SIX** \n&gt; * **$A** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$NVTA** \n&gt; * **$IMAX** \n&gt; * **$AG** \n&gt; * **$EXPD** \n&gt; * **$FSLR** \n&gt; * **$STNG** \n&gt; * **$AKS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/siAY14P.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

        "selftext": "* Okay. Let's get some shit out in the clear first. The way forward for gaming is **game streaming** by game streaming I mean cloud gaming services like Googles Stadia.\n* First of all **Why?**\n* Hardware is expensive in gaming. Like very expensive consider your gaming pc a goos high end gaming pc can easily be worth in excess of several *thousand* dollars which is often an upfront cost most casual gamers *cannot afford to cough up* andd most importantly if the latest games keep getting more intensive on ram and cpu you will need to upgrade it eventually anyway. This means that any cloud gaming service like Nvidia's GEFORCE NOW which is free for an hour of gaming before you need to relog or for roughly 5 pounds a month you can play with decent fps on almost any steam game (something which stadia doesn't allow you to do and is more expensive with an even smaller game pool to play on). Even if you have a MAC you can play steam games which is huge for the gaming market in general.\n* **What does this mean for my AMD tendies?**\nBasically AMD doesn't have a streaming service able to compete with Geforce Now. Geforce now has been in apply only beta for **3 fucking years already** and has accumulated 1 million users  before it went free for everyone to access use provided they queue for available slots on the service (if they have a free account that is (you starting to see the hook and draw tactic Nvidia is playing here?)). Amd is literally stuck in the past making hardware plays whilst Nvidia storms ahead in the game streaming market. Who cares is AMD is hooking up with Apple for a swanky new Mac if people wouldn't need to upgrade to said swanky new Mac cuz their getting their gaming and other capabilities on their old Mac's using Geforce Now. \n\n* **Okay I hear you, most people don't buy Mac's for gaming anyway**\nBut... amd is fundamentally a graphics card company and if you look at it in the perspective of a games streaming service such as Nvidias which already had a massive user base BEFORE it went public and easy to access. The growth potential on Nvidia rn is crazy. \n**So now that Geforce NOW has gone free and easily accessible how are the average consumers reacting?**\nOkay firstly there isn't a lot of statistics for this out yet considering Nvidia has only just fully released it from beta two weeks ago. However, whilst playing recently it has been impossible to miss a **sharp rise in people talking about and using geforce now in game** the ability to play any game regardless of your pc and only requiring a good internet speed (see starlink for any doubters that this will hold geforce now back) is too amazing to pass up on. The average user if they get the 5pound subscription will only spend like 60 bucks a year on Geforce Now compared to the 1000 they would have to spend to upgrade their pc. Also the versatility of geforce now is frankly scary. Consider playing games on ur phone,  TV, or anything for that matter. All u need is a good internet speed.\n**In summary** for this section is suspect geforce now is going through a period of **rocket** growth **you heard it here first** keep an eye on Q2 and Q3 NVDA to see whether or not they start talking about the potential there. Amd is legit getting slept on here I'm telling u\n\n* **TLDR** NVDA is developing a Netflix of game streaming that AMD is sleeping on and is UNDERCUTTING and OUTPERFORMING and quite honestly probably out selling google stadia. With 1 million beta users before going publicly available the growth potential is huge. **BUY NVDA longs at NVDA bottom and hold for YEAR END.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks expected to rise even as virus creates volatility: \u2018The market thinks the worst is over\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/stocks-expected-to-rise-even-as-virus-creates-volatility-the-market-thinks-the-worst-is-over.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to remain hostage to developments involving the coronavirus in the week ahead, and even so, the market could continue to hit new highs.\n*****\n&gt; Economists have been reducing China\u2019s growth outlook for the quarter, with some seeing little or no growth and then a bounce back in the high single digits next quarter. The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there\u2019s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can\u2019t believe what\u2019s coming out of China.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. \u201cThe market didn\u2019t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There\u2019s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday\u2019s Empire State and Thursday\u2019s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n*****\n&gt; # Profit warnings\n&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains\u201d and exporters, said Keon. \u201cIt will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn\u2019t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,\u201d Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.\n*****\n&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.\n*****\n&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. \u201cCould we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. \u201cIt trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,\u201d he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.\n*****\n&gt; # Resilient market\n&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there\u2019s more clarity on the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we\u2019re there,\u201d said Sluymer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a year-end target but I think it\u2019s higher.

But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.\n\n&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn\u2019t be a total surprise? \u201cYes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.\u201d In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October\u2019s gain of 2.29%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/february-is-usually-weak-but-has-been-the-best-month-the-past-10-years.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Record Pace of Records\n\n&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap\n\n&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.\n\n&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**\n\n&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/China-Percent.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Things Are Looking Up\n\n&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.\n\n&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER\n&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren\u2019t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.\n\n&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don\u2019t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n\n&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS\n&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/WMC_02102020_1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another \"Delay\" in the Value Trade\n\n&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of \"The time for value stocks to outperform is now.\" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**\n\n&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.\n\n&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.\n\n&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 14th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.16.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$ENPH** \n&gt; * **$INMD** \n&gt; * **$TRU** \n&gt; * **$WAB** \n&gt; * **$AEIS** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$BHC** \n&gt; * **$VMC** \n&gt; * **$GRMN** \n&gt; * **$LDOS** \n&gt; * **$TSEM** \n&gt; * **$ECL** \n&gt; * **$ALLE** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$OLED** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$NXRT** \n&gt; * **$BLMN** \n&gt; * **$ATH** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$FANG** \n&gt; * **$CEQP** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$FLR** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$VG** \n&gt; * **$SIX** \n&gt; * **$A** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$NVTA** \n&gt; * **$IMAX** \n&gt; * **$AG** \n&gt; * **$EXPD** \n&gt; * **$FSLR** \n&gt; * **$STNG** \n&gt; * **$AKS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/siAY14P.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu\u2019s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so.\n\nNVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably. Not sure what NVDA would then do in this space, especially since cloud gaming may dislodge their GPU sales in consumer devices.\n\nLeaning towards AMD at the moment but would welcome any thoughts.",

        "selftext": "I believe that video game business will continue to grow in the future. I think the gamkng industry will outperform the general market,and want to invest. \n\nPure developers are rarely (if any) publicly traded and would probably be too volatile revenue wise anyway for a halfways safe investment.\n\nA number of large publishers are publically traded, but I find it difficult to make a smart decision that's not purely based on my taste. In particular, as the huge and fast growing Asian market appears to like games I would never even consider buying. \n\nAnother issue is that some stocks where I'd take the risk to put (not all but some) eggs in the same basket are traded in stock exchanges my broker doesn't offer (specifically CD Project Red with their upcoming Cyberpunk 2077, Polish stock exchange). \n\nFurthermore, unfortunately my broker charges quite high commissions per trade (I am Swiss and want to continue to use a Swiss broker at this point). This means if I do diversification on my own it becomes expensive rather quickly (it doesn't make sense to buy stocks for less than let's say 2-3K USD per trade).\n\nSo I checked out two (maybe: the two) existing gaming ETFs: GAMR and ESPO. They appear to track the same gaming &amp; eSports index. The index has a history of beating other industry indices in the past, which would confirm the thesis that gaming is an interesting markwt to invest in. On the surface, these ETFs look rather solid. \n\nNow my problem is the following: If I look at the individual companies tracked by this index and held by these ETFs there are some great companies I certainly would love to see in a the basket, like the large US publishers, some Japanese companies, NVidia &amp; AMD (don't forget the hardware), and even CD Project Red. However, there are also a large number of companies I'd never buy and which just look very bad to me if I check them out. Mainly Asian companies that may have had some big MMO or mobile game hit a couple of years in the past (hence maybe slipped into the index), but seem to struggle to repeat this success in the last couple of years or appear to be focused on completely different businesses nowadays (like mobile payment, webhosting, obscure asian social media stuff, etc.). Some with websites that look like 2002 instead of 2020 (eg. nc soft), some with financials &amp; investor information that scream bancruptcy if they don't manage to land a big hit in the next year or so (eg. sea inc). \n\nHas anyone found a smart way to invest in gaming? I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on my problem.",

        "selftext": "So unlike most other companies that post their earnings only every quarter, $TSM posts for every month. They'll be posting their January numbers on Feb 10th(from what I've heard). \n\nDuring their last earnings call, they said their guidance for this quarter was around a 50% increase in sales. What got them down Jan 16, was their earnings to revunue ratio which was not as good as last year, and because of that it suffered the same fate as Facebook for their earnings.\n\nNow this up to 50% increase in earnings is honestly beyond expectations. $TSM has factory production in China but said that they wouldn't be effected by the virus. So, although I have a high amount of calls in $TSM, I would like to say that this is not only something to buy calls for. But serves as a indicator. If Apple, Hauwei, and others cancelled orders from $TSM then it shows truly how bad the virus is and that we should be buying puts for Apple's likely dissapointing sales for this upcoming quarter. This should be reflected on $TSM's numbers. And if they truly hit a 50% increase in comparison to last year, hella buy calls for Apple, AMD, NVDA, and AMAT. But if it doesn't even come close be prepared for a rough first quarter.",

Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu\u2019s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so.\n\nNVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably. Not sure what NVDA would then do in this space, especially since cloud gaming may dislodge their GPU sales in consumer devices.\n\nLeaning towards AMD at the moment but would welcome any thoughts.",

I saw that it may cause some damage for the AirPods production.\n\n\nMSFT, my concern on this is that it is in a huge spike right now, so maybe should I wait for the first dip and buy then?\n\n\nNVDA, I like its efforts in the self-deiving cars development, edge computing, all trends that will be huge int he future imo, but I\u2019m not too sure about it, also because I own AMD and I think i should maybe get something different.\n\n\nINTC, I think that they\u2019ll have a big part in the 5G world, and also the Olympics eSport is a project I think will be a success for them.  Same thoguht about owning AMD.\n\n\nTSM, I don\u2019t know much about this company, but the semiconductor need in the future can only get higher, so seem a good investment\n\n\nLSCC, same as TSM.\n\n\n\nAlso another question is: do you think I should sell RACE to buy some of these, or keep it?\n\n\n\nAny advice and criticism is appreciated, am new to this world and wanna learn as much as possible.\n\nThanks to anyone who made it this far, have a good day!",

NVDA dropped some just like everything else today but has since recovered and even punched through that $271.98 with a high of $272.30 however my option contract did not breach or even meet the $2.37 it hit at the $271.98 open from this morning.  Is this due to changes in IV or other factors im just not thinking about?  \n\nI\u2019ve seen this a few times where the underlying starts off high, and bounces a bit with some higher peaks later in the day while the option contract does not necessarily correlate with its own daily session highs.",

Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, February 10th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/futures-steady-trump-new-budget-and-coronavirus-deaths-exceed-sars.html)\n\n* With coronavirus concerns still very much in the mix, U.S. stock futures point to more losses for Wall Street following a Friday sell-off. The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq\u2019s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February\u2019s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high. (CNBC)\n* The Trump administration will release its fiscal 2021 budget today, which will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years. It\u2019s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump\u2019s promised \u201cTax Cuts 2.0.\u201d (CNBC)\n* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump\u2019s 2021 budget (CNBC)\n* No economic releases are on today\u2019s calendar. Two Fed officials have public speaking engagements today, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman making a morning appearance in Florida and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker speaking this afternoon in Delaware. (CNBC)\n* Allergan (AGN), Edgewell Personal Care (EPC), and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) are among the companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning. Callaway Golf (ELY) and XPO Logistics (XPO) issue numbers after the closing bell.\n* Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 9% in the premarket this morning after a tumultuous week, which saw the stock move more than $100 per share in either direction in three of five sessions. Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)\n* China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country. The U.K. has confirmed four further cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight. (CNBC)\n* Factories in China remain shuttered as some regions extend shutdowns (CNBC)\n* As virus deaths top SARS, survivor tells of treatment (WSJ)\n* Sen. Bernie Sanders remains at the top of the Democratic field in a new NBC News/Marist poll of tomorrow\u2019s New Hampshire primary. Sanders gets 25% of likely Democratic primary voters in the poll, while former Mayor Pete Buttigieg receives support from 21%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, comes in at 13%. (CNBC)\n* Biden predicts he will \u2018take a hit\u2019 in New Hampshire primary after \u2018gut punch\u2019 in Iowa (CNBC)\n* Mike Bloomberg is the only Democrat to top Trump in Gallup poll of small business owners (CNBC)\n* The Iowa Democratic Party allocated delegates based on the results of last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses, giving Buttigieg the largest delegate count, followed closely by Sanders, though many news outlets remained unable to declare a winner. Sanders\u2019 campaign plans to ask for a \u201cpartial recanvass\u201d of the results of last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses. (NBC News &amp; AP)\n* Sen. Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr\u2019s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)\n* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)\n* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria\u2019s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It\u2019s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he\u2019s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. (CNBC)\n* The federally appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico\u2019s ongoing record debt restructuring saga announced they have come to terms with bondholders of around $35 billion, which accounts for nearly 50% of the bankrupt island\u2019s total debt load.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks expected to rise even as virus creates volatility: \u2018The market thinks the worst is over\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/stocks-expected-to-rise-even-as-virus-creates-volatility-the-market-thinks-the-worst-is-over.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to remain hostage to developments involving the coronavirus in the week ahead, and even so, the market could continue to hit new highs.\n*****\n&gt; Economists have been reducing China\u2019s growth outlook for the quarter, with some seeing little or no growth and then a bounce back in the high single digits next quarter. The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there\u2019s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can\u2019t believe what\u2019s coming out of China.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. \u201cThe market didn\u2019t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There\u2019s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday\u2019s Empire State and Thursday\u2019s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n*****\n&gt; # Profit warnings\n&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains\u201d and exporters, said Keon. \u201cIt will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn\u2019t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,\u201d Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.\n*****\n&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.\n*****\n&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. \u201cCould we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. \u201cIt trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,\u201d he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.\n*****\n&gt; # Resilient market\n&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there\u2019s more clarity on the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we\u2019re there,\u201d said Sluymer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a year-end target but I think it\u2019s higher. I think we\u2019re in a sloppy range. I think it\u2019s range bound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. \u201cStocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he\u2019s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year. But that\u2019s the way we have our portfolios positioned \u2014 the market will work its way higher this year,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGXae0P.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZsVPAZO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DE2dIMR.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/iGBF28x.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rMe9946.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ps9FL8g.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C48fTcF.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lJgq8up.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKn6MfJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/A3rPbpC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QLBnp9J.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SfzBNHl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 12 of Last 14\n\n&gt; February\u2019s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 26 years with an average loss of 0.20% for S&amp;P 500. Despite a bumpy finish, expiration week as a whole has fared better, but nets an average gain of just 0.47% on the S&amp;P 500 since 1994 with 17 of 26 winning weeks. More recently, S&amp;P 500 has advanced in twelve of the last fourteen options expiration weeks. The week after, has been down 13 of the last 26 years. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar patterns over the same timeframe.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72543f9b28ca268bee1f7dde79af6759/d9f94c53e26f1367-0f/s500x750/53f9e9a38b23b8c2481554e6f56238283009fb98.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1af227b4449cde52fe1100be5cc8fff2/d9f94c53e26f1367-84/s500x750/1701058d1cd50c8f1568e98537f0bb69053f45be.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8da900c074796667d88849ff6e47c46/d9f94c53e26f1367-32/s500x750/7449549dcd57b5281333fdd73c9066b813280fa1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Trading After Presidents\u2019 Day Weekend Still Weak\n\n&gt; Yesterday\u2019s post, showed improvement the two days before Presidents\u2019 Day Weekend the past 10 years. But the two days after still display a lot of red. Since 1990 Tuesday after Presidents\u2019 Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 12 losses for median gain of 0.14% and an average loss of \u20130.22%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is net loser down 18 of 30 years with and average loss of \u20130.50% and a median loss of \u20130.21%.\n\n&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has greater magnitude of decline. On the Wednesday after the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 30 with an average loss of \u20130.08% and a median decline of \u20130.16%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 30, average \u20130.04%, median \u20130.11% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 30, average \u20130.04%, median \u20130.14%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7361619e7cab4e66e7b763004f9ece08/171366798232cbac-89/s500x750/150244b6c1313f56a10c2f665ae84006aa531790.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Closer Look At February\n\n&gt; A late month selloff in January saw the S&amp;P 500 Index close marginally lower for the month. But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.\n\n&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn\u2019t be a total surprise? \u201cYes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.\u201d In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October\u2019s gain of 2.29%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/february-is-usually-weak-but-has-been-the-best-month-the-past-10-years.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Record Pace of Records\n\n&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap\n\n&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.\n\n&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**\n\n&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/China-Percent.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Things Are Looking Up\n\n&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.\n\n&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER\n&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren\u2019t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.\n\n&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don\u2019t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n\n&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS\n&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/WMC_02102020_1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another \"Delay\" in the Value Trade\n\n&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of \"The time for value stocks to outperform is now.\" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**\n\n&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.\n\n&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.\n\n&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed\u2019s neutral stand on interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus\u2019 progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created \u2014 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data has been very positive, but it\u2019s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn\u2019t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week \u2014 Tesla.\n*****\n&gt; The electric car maker\u2019s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,\u201d said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. \u201cI really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it\u2019s not as crazy as it was in 1999.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Maley said now that the stock has \u201cwashed out\u201d on the upside, there\u2019s likely more downside ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that\u2019s usually a sign of a top as well,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Brakes on growth\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China\u2019s economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,\u201d he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s consumer price index and Friday\u2019s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.\n*****\n&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing\u2019s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,\u201d said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. \u201cMost of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith the strong jobs, I think it\u2019s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,\u201d said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThey mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they\u2019re thinking about that. That\u2019s the main thing we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf we\u2019re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,\u201d the economists wrote in a note. \u201cWe assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings Bonanza\n&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market\u2019s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.\n*****\n&gt; # Playing Politics\n&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa\u2019s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire\u2019s primary Tuesday will also be important.\n*****\n&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,\u201d said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. \u201d[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he\u2019s more that could be a market negative development.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qOqI74J.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/n8uJhuY.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/qSPsa54.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yKvMhID.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qFnHyJw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Zwtq6za.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Crf7CiP.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSa5dB3.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8e4snrC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O4BbZMh.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4df33Zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YwquWUG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nJe64uF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Week Before Presidents\u2019 Day Bullish since 1990\n\n&gt; Page 100 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents\u2019 Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87d4499ef13ff59956f4c6343e3c411e/5b2bbadb398d5a54-f0/s500x750/24f2f57a33d656e400f05e96ccd367ce42aa6af8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020\n\n&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.\n\n&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December\u2019s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December\u2019s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market\u2019s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.\n\n&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. \u201cToday\u2019s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cBut the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.\u201d\n\n&gt; The one slight blip in today\u2019s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.\n\n*****\n\n# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls\n\n&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market\u2019s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07db71096c88ddf9778d29d0bdb69e60/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-86/s500x750/e6f5479d3cea9759bc52d0c99fff7704947ff575.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb9b967be268f1fcb154d09dfa8553b/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-2c/s500x750/4f3021be20791991f739de9273300f798a7cbf31.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In the above charts, the market\u2019s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market\u2019s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January\u2019s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally\n\n&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February\u2019s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10b0e0be07d6824e6a082e13a26bc1d9/e1ddcea381248255-b9/s500x750/a2b1e806df3ec07b5e77c69efd297e5802fa1208.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed\u2019s neutral stand on interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus\u2019 progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created \u2014 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data has been very positive, but it\u2019s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn\u2019t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week \u2014 Tesla.\n*****\n&gt; The electric car maker\u2019s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,\u201d said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. \u201cI really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it\u2019s not as crazy as it was in 1999.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Maley said now that the stock has \u201cwashed out\u201d on the upside, there\u2019s likely more downside ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that\u2019s usually a sign of a top as well,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Brakes on growth\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China\u2019s economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,\u201d he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s consumer price index and Friday\u2019s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.\n*****\n&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing\u2019s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,\u201d said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. \u201cMost of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith the strong jobs, I think it\u2019s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,\u201d said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThey mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they\u2019re thinking about that. That\u2019s the main thing we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf we\u2019re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,\u201d the economists wrote in a note. \u201cWe assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings Bonanza\n&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market\u2019s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.\n*****\n&gt; # Playing Politics\n&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa\u2019s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire\u2019s primary Tuesday will also be important.\n*****\n&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,\u201d said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. \u201d[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he\u2019s more that could be a market negative development.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qOqI74J.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/n8uJhuY.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/qSPsa54.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yKvMhID.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qFnHyJw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Zwtq6za.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Crf7CiP.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSa5dB3.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8e4snrC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O4BbZMh.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4df33Zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YwquWUG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nJe64uF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Week Before Presidents\u2019 Day Bullish since 1990\n\n&gt; Page 100 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents\u2019 Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87d4499ef13ff59956f4c6343e3c411e/5b2bbadb398d5a54-f0/s500x750/24f2f57a33d656e400f05e96ccd367ce42aa6af8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020\n\n&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.\n\n&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December\u2019s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December\u2019s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market\u2019s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.\n\n&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. \u201cToday\u2019s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cBut the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.\u201d\n\n&gt; The one slight blip in today\u2019s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.\n\n*****\n\n# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls\n\n&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market\u2019s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07db71096c88ddf9778d29d0bdb69e60/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-86/s500x750/e6f5479d3cea9759bc52d0c99fff7704947ff575.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb9b967be268f1fcb154d09dfa8553b/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-2c/s500x750/4f3021be20791991f739de9273300f798a7cbf31.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In the above charts, the market\u2019s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market\u2019s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January\u2019s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally\n\n&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February\u2019s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10b0e0be07d6824e6a082e13a26bc1d9/e1ddcea381248255-b9/s500x750/a2b1e806df3ec07b5e77c69efd297e5802fa1208.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gdnoSkR_Hk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kQxYZ5sv6E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

        "selftext": "Just curious to hear what some people use as stop-losses for naked far OTM puts.  I usually use about 25% from entry.  However, that obviously has its drawbacks especially during mini-flash crashes like today's.  NVDA caught me during its rug-pull.  It was enough to cause some hairy moves and fight-or-flight kicked in.   \n\nJust looking for some other POVs.  Thx",
