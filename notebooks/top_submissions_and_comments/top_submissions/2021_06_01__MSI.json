        "selftext": "tl;dr: Katapult Holdings (KPLT) is one of the best former SPACs in the market today. It has a dirt cheap valuation vs. its peers, and the growth runway is massive. Long shares.\n\nKatapult Holdings (KPLT) recently went public through a reverse merger with the SPAC Finserv Acquisition (FSRV). Katapult is a leading \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) player that provides financing options for non-prime customers. The newly merged company had its first quarterly earnings this week, and execution was solid. Katapult is still caught in a pool of negative SPAC sentiment, but it's no longer a SPAC. KPLT is profitable, growing quickly, and trading at a huge discount to other players in this field. I believe Katapult is a $25 stock trading for $11.30. Keep reading if you want to know why.\n\n## What Is Katapult?\n\nKatapult\u00a0provides BNPL options for non-prime Ecommerce customers. Katapult is the only pure-play financing platform dedicated to Ecommerce, as shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgow6tippo571.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec0894080a04d8772cc96f083047c545ca74709f\n\n*Source: Initial Investor Presentation*\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 38% of US consumers are considered nonprime, making it difficult for these consumers to access financing options. Additionally, 67% of consumers with a FICO score below 700 need a BNPL option for large purchases. Katapult provides this solution for online customers. Katapult's platform integrates seamlessly to merchant sites, so customers can choose the financing option as they check out.\u00a0\n\nConsumers are given three payment options through Katapult:\n\n* **First 90 Days**\n   * Customers only pay the cash price + a 5% fee.\n* **After 90 Days**\n   * Customers can complete the purchase at a significant discount to the full lease-to-own cost.\n* **Full Lease Term**\n   * Payment is \\~2x the lease origination amount over the life of the lease.\n\nKatapult is partnered with merchants such as Wayfair, Lenovo, Purple, and Motorola. The company also has partner integrations with Ecommerce platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, and OpenCart. Katapult gives online platforms access to larger customer bases and higher repeat purchase rates (45%).\u00a0\n\nKatapult also uses a \"waterfall\" method to gain customers that failed prime lending applications. When consumers fail to get financing from prime lenders like Affirm, they are passed on to Katapult.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e1vkntqrpo571.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84b10776e62145d0ba7ec86ae1c99ec2e5c83a20\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nAs you can see from the graph above, Katapult approves \\~60% of consumers who failed prime lender applications. These \"waterfall\" applicants generate $117M incremental originations per 1M applications.\n\nKatapult's risk model reviews over 100 attributes, including lease history, prior payment behavior, and behavioral biometrics, to approve or deny applicants in under five seconds. The company has a sub-3% fraud rate across its portfolio, and it recovers 80- 90% of lease costs of charge offs.\n\nKatapult has also gotten more efficient as its platform has grown.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zqux65tpo571.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2517c17311104765f4f5e6d3e115ccd0b0b23c5f\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nIndexed return on leases have increased each year as Katapult's customer base has expanded.\n\n## Q1 Performance\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Katapult went public through a SPAC. SPACs are notorious for providing and falling short of aggressive revenue projections. Here are Katapult's projections from December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwicqjfupo571.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11af0770fa0cd0c8caca333a9aa775b04a19bea3\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nNow let's see how the company performed. Katapult released Q1 earnings yesterday. The company did $82M in revenue, up 88% year over year. Net income was $8.1M, or a 120% increase from Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.7M, good for a 122% increase over last year too.\n\nHow about forward guidance?\u00a0\n\n* Gross Originations: $375-$425 million\n* Revenue: $425-$475 million\n* Adjusted EBITDA: $50-$60 million\n\nWhile the EBITDA target dropped slightly, revenue and originations are in line with December's projections.\n\n### Relationship with Wayfair\n\nOne metric that stood out to me was the acceleration of originations from non-Wayfair merchants. 58% of Katapult's revenue came from Wayfair in 2020. However, in Q1 2021, Non-Wayfair originations were up 87.4%. This is compared to a 66% increase in Q4 2020 and 46.1% for FY 2020. Meanwhile, Wayfair originations were up 57.7%. Recent execution suggests that Katapult is making great strides to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest source of income, Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas is not concerned. In a recent interview, he said this about their parternship with Wayfair:\n\n\"*I\u2019m not worried about it because if you\u2019re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we\u2019re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We\u2019re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. \\[\u2026.\\] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it\u2019s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.*\"\n\nWith Katapult hinting at a deeper partnership with the furniture retailer, and the company showing accelerated growth in its non-Wayfair base, I am not too concerned with the heavy revenue concentration.\n\n## Valuation Gap\n\nValuation is the driving factor in my Katapult bull thesis. The stock is dirt cheap. While several SPACs have priced deals at sky-high valuations, FSRV took KPLT public at a $1B valuation with $450M in 2021 revenue.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdo6f56wpo571.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3caf59027610ec14f7399f15a5c11377dedc2e0\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nThe graphic above comes from the December investor presentation. 14x EBITDA for a company growing sales, net income, and EBITDA at \\~100% for the last three years is great value by itself. When you compare this to other companies in the sector, Katapult looks criminally undervalued.\u00a0\n\nLet's look at the valuation gap now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rumeltjxpo571.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23caf2299e138627232893b5dda1b33d68dc0f62\n\nAt Tuesday's $11.37 price, Katapult was trading at 2.7x sales and 22.3x EBITDA. That's less than 1/3 of PayPal's (PYPL) revenue multiple and 1/2 of Paypal's EBITDA multiple, despite growing revenue 3x faster. When compared to Affirm (AFRM), a more direct competitor, the valuation gap is even larger.\n\n22.4x revenue for an unprofitable company growing at 40%, vs. 2.7x revenue for a profitable company growing at 65%. If Katapult went public through a traditional IPO, it would be worth over $2B right now. Because it used a SPAC, sentiment around the stock has been poor.\n\n## Growth Prospects\n\nA study from Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from $226B in 2021 to $995B by 2026. 55% of Americans used a BNPL option as of March 2021, vs. just 37% in July 2020. There will be room for a lot of winners in this market, and Katapult will be one of them.\n\nKatapult is forecasting over $1B in revenue by 2023, and the company could beat this number if it keeps aggressively expanding to include new merchants. Katapult added 26 new retail partners in Q1 alone. Additionally, Katapult will benefit from the growth of its current partners like Wayfair.\n\n## Risks\n\nLike any investment, Katapult has its fair share of risks. The primary risk factors are:\n\n* Customer concentration\n* Credit risk from nonprime consumers\n* Competitors entering the nonprime market\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest customer, Katapult has been growing its non-Wayfair revenue base at an accelerating rate. Management assured investors that Wayfair would be a partner for a long time, so I don't foresee this risk causing any issues with business in the short term. Katapult has also been able to post consistent profits while dealing with nonprime customers, and its risk model has proven to be more accurate as the customer base expands. Finally, I don't see Affirm or another competitor taking market share from Katapult. KPLT has a multi-year head start in this market niche, and it has been able to scale its operations profitably. While other companies could enter this sector in the future, the total addressable market is large enough to accommodate multiple players.\u00a0\n\n## Conclusion\n\nKatapult is a criminally undervalued stock given its growth rate and competitors' valuations, and I think it should be trading around $25 per share. As we move further away from the SPAC merger, Katapult will trade on its own merit, and I think the stock will appreciate accordingly. Assuming Katapult continues to scale its revenue and expand its customer base, I think the stock has a massive growth runway. I'm long shares, and I plan to hold them for a while.",

Afterpay (64.23 P/S, no earnings, $23.57b MC USD)\n\n**What Separates Katapult from it's Peers?**\n\nLike Affirm, Klarna, Sezzle, and Afterpay - Katapult is a buy now pay later company; however, Katapult recognizes competition is for retards, so they focus on non-prime consumers that are primarily online. As a degenerate myself, I had to look up what a non-prime consumer is. A non-prime consumer has a credit score between subprime and prime. About 38% of consumers are under served by prime credit products, so the market Katapult targets is large with little competition and plenty of room to grow. E-commerce itself will continue to grow, and Katapult will continue to partner with more mid to large cap retailers. Katapult is partnered and integrated with some fantastic companies and platforms already, such as Wayfair, Motorola, Lenovo, Affirm, and Shopify.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TrustPilot Reviews](https://preview.redd.it/q4fp76827h571.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=237e1143907762d89cc298bbfb2ae821d6db2aa3)\n\n**Why is Katapult being Neglected?**\n\nTruth be told Katapult isn't being neglected, at least not by institutions. Plenty of institutions have a $12.80+ average, which is well above the current price. The PIPE was led by Tiger Global. Tiger Global returned more than ANY OTHER fund in 2020, so smart money is certainly in on Katapult. During the SPACopalypse in February, retail traders completely lost interest in SPACs, regardless of whether the target companies we're dogs, frauds, or legitimate unicorns. Now that it has fully merged, I believe were ready to make a move up.\n\n**Positions**\n\n2600 shares at $12.56 average\n\n30 June 18 12.5c at $1.05 average purchased Friday.

        "selftext": "Below is a breakdown of a recent WSJ article about 5G in the US. I added some bullets throughout the article  based on some research.  Even though I disagree with a few of the author's points, I think it's a solid article and helped me understand 5G a bit more. \n\nAt the end, I included some of my own opinions. Hopefully this helps everyone better understand what is going on right now. I have a large position in one of these companies. I have decided to keep it out of this sub, but if you check my post history I am sure you can figure it out. \n\n**The U.S. Is Back in the 5G Game**\n\n*By* Stu Woo*,* May 26, 2021 12:00 pm ET\n\nThe U.S. government has upended the **$35 billion-a-year cellular-equipment industry**, ushering in a new era of competition and giving U.S. companies a shot at re-entering a sector they vacated years ago.\n\n\u00b7 The $35 billion number they reference here only refers to the US. 2020 estimates the industry in the mid $400 billion range and most projections see this industry growing to the mid $500 billion range by 2023 and mid $700 billion range by 2027. \n\nIn the past five years, only China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co., Sweden\u2019s Ericsson and Finland\u2019s Nokia Corp. captured more than a 20% share of revenue in the wireless-equipment market, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group, a research firm. **No other competitor consistently cracked even 10%.**\n\n\u00b7 Huawei: 2020 revenue was $136.7 billion, not publicly traded so no market cap, 180,000+ employees\n\n\u00b7 Ericsson (ERIC): 2020 revenue of $25.3 billion, market cap of $44.4 billion, valuation of 1.75X, 100K employees\n\n\u00b7 Nokia (NOK): 2020 revenue of $24.96 billion, market cap of $29.8 billion, valuation of 1.19X, 92k employees\n\nNow that landscape is [changing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-loses-cellular-gear-market-share-outside-china-11615118400?mod=article_inline). Pushed by Washington\u2019s campaign to cripple Huawei over cybersecurity concerns, **countries representing more than 60% of the world\u2019s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against Huawei**, says Dell\u2019Oro Group. And to take advantage of that opening, the U.S. government\u2014as well as governments in the U.K. and European Union\u2014are considering financial support and other measures to boost domestic cellular-equipment makers trying to crack the three incumbents\u2019 stranglehold on the market.\n\nThe result is a newly competitive market that is reminiscent of the 1990s, when bygone industry giants such as Lucent, Motorola, Nortel, Siemens and Alcatel fought for a piece of a growing telecom-equipment pie.\n\n\u00b7 Lucent merged with Alcatel in 2006 to form Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia absorbed Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. \n\n\u00b7 Motorola split into Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions in 2011. Google acquired Motorola Mobility which, focuses on phones, in 2012 which was then sold to Lenovo in 2015. Motorola Solutions (MSI) 2020 revenue of $7.4 billion, market cap of $35.2 billion, valuation of 4.76X, 18K employees.\n\no MSI appears to focus on smaller, private networks especially in public safety. \n\n\u00b7 Nortel: Went bankrupt in 2009 and Ericsson purchased most of its telecommunication assets over the next few years. \n\n\u00b7 Siemens (SIEGY): 2020 revenue of $69.4 billion, market cap of $140.6 billion, valuation of 2.03X, 293k employees (manufactures switchboards and 5G routers)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a Wild West feel to it,\u201d says Bill Plummer, a former Nokia and Huawei executive now working at JMA Wireless, a Syracuse, N.Y., 5G company. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this since probably the eve of the dot-com bust\u2014this dynamic and thriving competitive environment in wireless.\u201d\n\nThat new environment could benefit everyone\u2014other than, of course, Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. It will give a host of competitors a chance to win business that only a couple of years ago seemed out of reach. And the new competitive fervor should increase innovation and lower costs for wireless carriers, which could pass on savings\u2014and the fruits of those innovations\u2014to customers.\n\nAmerican officials further say the new competitive landscape is crucial to U.S. efforts to counter China\u2019s influence in developing 5G technology, **the next generation of wireless technology that will serve as the building blocks for all sorts of future technologies\u2014whether in robot-run factories, heart-rate monitors, or any number of industries and products. The country that dominates 5G will be well-positioned to lead the technology industry in terms of profits and talent in the years ahead.**\n\n**The 3G days**\n\nAfter a vibrant start to the 3G era in the 2000s, when manufacturers throughout North America, Europe and Asia competed, equipment manufacturers started consolidating amid pressure from Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE Corp. which were both selling increasingly competitive hardware at lower prices. In 2016, Nokia\u2019s acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, itself a merger of French and American companies, created today\u2019s three-giant oligopoly.\n\nThe Trump administration began loosening the trio\u2019s grip on the market in 2018 when it started urging allies to blacklist industry leader Huawei over national-security concerns. **The campaign worked: Huawei lost market share outside China to both Ericsson and Nokia last year**, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group, as governments enacted or considered restrictions on Huawei\u2019s equipment.\n\n\u201cThe big change over the past couple of years is pressure on Huawei,\u201d says James Barford, a telecom analyst for Enders Analysis. \u201cEven in countries where there is no formal ban, you\u2019re going to be thinking twice\u201d about using equipment from the Chinese company.\n\nThe stranglehold of the big three was further weakened by Nokia\u2019s blunder in procuring expensive chips for its 5G equipment\u2014a mistake that resulted in its equipment costing more upfront, as well as consuming more power. That\u2019s an issue for wireless carriers, which can spend roughly 20% of operating expenses on energy. Nokia says it has since moved to cheaper, power-efficient chips, but damage was done: Some carriers looked elsewhere for supplies.\n\n\u00b7 This appears to still be up in the air, but Pekka Lundmark, Nokia\u2019s CEO, seemed adamant in an interview after Q1 that chips are no longer an issue for Nokia. We shall see. \n\nWith both Huawei and Nokia under pressure, that left Ericsson as the market leader outside China. But that, in turn, made wireless carriers\u2019 executives wary. They say they want more competition to increase innovation and reduce costs.\n\nThe result has been an opening for a whole new generation of competitors\u2014and the Wild West environment.\n\n**The open gambit**\n\nSome carriers are turning to Samsung Electronics Co. , the South Korean smartphone giant that is a relative newcomer to the wireless-infrastructure industry. It ranked fifth behind the three giants and China\u2019s ZTE in 2020, but won a major victory last year when Verizon Communications Inc. switched suppliers from Nokia to Samsung.\n\n\u00b7 ZTE: 2020 revenue of $15.86 billion, market cap of $21.84 billion, valuation of 1.38X, 74k employees (traded on Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges)\n\n\u00b7 Samsung: 2020 revenue of $212 billion, market cap of $500 billion, valuation of 2.36X, 109k or 284K employees (traded on Korean Stock Market)\n\nBut it\u2019s the possibility of buying 5G equipment using open-standards software that has the most potential for roiling the competitive order.\n\nTo understand why, consider that the cellular equipment that transmits signals to phones consists of three parts: the antenna, hardware that sits on a pole directly under the antenna, and more hardware at the pole\u2019s base. **Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia currently sell all three parts in a bundle, and they aren\u2019t interoperable**. For instance, a Huawei antenna doesn\u2019t work with Ericsson electronics under the antenna.\n\nIt would be like buying a Dell laptop that works with only a Dell monitor and Dell printer. And it means customers have limited options on price, quality and features.\n\nEnter a new technology based on open standards, dubbed **Open RAN**, or radio access network. Companies making equipment based on these standards **allow wireless carriers to mix and match the antennas with different under-antenna hardware and centralized electronics**. That gives carriers more options for cost and quality.\n\n\u00b7 Huawei: Does not believe in the use of Open RAN.\n\n\u00b7 Ericsson: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 Nokia: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 ZTE: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 Samsung: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\nThe U.S. government is a major backer of the open-software efforts, which officials say could boost both U.S. national security and business. It potentially can help U.S. businesses by creating openings for new players, and because these new efforts rely less on hardware (where the U.S. has fallen behind) and more on software (where companies such as [**Microsoft**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) **Corp**. and [**International Business Machines**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IBM) **Corp**. can potentially play a role).\n\n\u00b7 Microsoft: Partnership with Ericsson focuses on the auto industry. Partnership with Nokia focuses on cloud solutions for enterprise. Dealings with Huawei appear to be smartphone based, not 5G. \n\n\u00b7 IBM: Has partnered with Ericsson in the past, but appears to be working more closely with Nokia and Samsung recently. \n\n\u201cWe may be able to increase security, reduce our exposure to any single foreign vendor, lower costs and push the equipment market to where the United States is uniquely skilled\u2014in software,\u201d Federal Communications Commission Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in March.\n\nIf U.S. companies do indeed become major players in 5G equipment, then they can also play a bigger role in setting global standards for telecom equipment. That\u2019s an arena where China has made great strides. U.S. officials prefer that companies in the U.S. and allied democracies set wireless standards, which they believe would lead to greater, less hackable security.\n\nPresident Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide last month agreed that the U.S. and Japan would collaborate to advance open 5G networks \u201cby fostering innovation and by promoting trustworthy vendors and diverse markets,\u201d the White House said. Congress this year enacted a law to establish a Commerce Department fund that would award grants to support the use of such open-standards equipment in the U.S. A bipartisan group of lawmakers backing the bill requested $750 million for the fund in fiscal year 2022.\n\nIn the U.K., a government-appointed task force to help British wireless carriers transition away from Huawei equipment recommended that new equipment makers, or those using open-standards software, represent 25% of the country\u2019s wireless infrastructure by the mid-2020s. The task force recommended government incentives for wireless carriers buying such equipment, and for suppliers to locate research facilities in the U.K. The European Union this year started examining similar options.\n\n**The focus of newcomers**\n\nSeveral smaller U.S. companies\u2014such as [Airspan Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AIRO), Altiostar, Mavenir, JMA and Parallel Wireless\u2014are focused on 5G equipment using open software. Ericsson and Nokia are also shifting to using some open-standard software.\n\nThe new challengers have signed deals with some big carriers. [AT&amp;T](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) Inc. is testing open-standards equipment and plans to gradually introduce it, while newcomer wireless-carrier [Dish Network](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DISH) Corp. has said its entire network would rely on such infrastructure.\n\n\u00b7 [Airspan Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AIRO) (AIRO): 2020 revenue was $54.7 million, market cap of 11.9 million, valuation of 0.22X, 900 employees\n\n\u00b7 Altiostar: 2020 revenue was $10-50 million, not publicly traded so no market cap, 359 employees, they are pre IPO and Qualcomm is an investor\n\n\u00b7 Mavenir (MVNR): 2020 revenue was $462 million, market cap of $1.72 billion, valuation of 3.72X, 4,200employees\n\n\u00b7 JMA: 2020 revenue was $369 million, not publicly traded so no market cap, 1,000 employees\n\n\u00b7 Parallel Wireless: 2020 revenue was $75 million , not publicly traded so no market cap, 450 employees\n\n\u00b7 Dish Network Corp: Rumored to be trying to become the 4th major US network behind Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile. Partnered with Nokia on 5G software. Has worked with Ericsson in the past, but has been working closer with Mavenir and Qualcomm lately. \n\n\u00b7 AT&amp;T: Has 5 year deal with Nokia for 5G services. Also has a deal with Nokia on 5G software. Partners with Ericsson on Private 5G Networks. Appears to be trying to move away from Huawei, but still works with them outside of US. \n\nDell\u2019Oro Group predicts that equipment using open standards, from both newcomers and incumbents transitioning into the new market, **will capture 10% of the market by 2025**.\n\n\u201cThe operators say, \u2018We need choice, we need a strong ecosystem,\u2019 \u201d says Thierry Maupil\u00e9, a former Motorola and [Cisco Systems](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CSCO) Inc. executive who now works at Altiostar, which provides software for open-standards 5G equipment. **\u201cYou have a playing field that has been reduced to a few companies.\u201d**\n\nStill, **open-standards equipment remains in its early stages**, and it is too soon to know whether it will be a major player. Wireless carriers say their tests of open-standards equipment show some drawbacks. The new technology can be less energy-efficient than today\u2019s conventional systems. And while the open-standards equipment can be used in rural areas, its performance isn\u2019t yet up to snuff in densely populated urban areas.\n\n**But wireless carriers expect the open-standards equipment to be on par with Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia equipment in three or four years.**\n\n\u201cFor us, it is critical to maintain competition in our vendor system,\u201d says Michael Trabbia, chief technology officer at French carrier Orange SA. **\u201cWe cannot end up with only two players.\u201d**\n\n\u00b7 The two players are of course Nokia and Ericsson with Huawei more and more out of the picture with more than 60% of the world\u2019s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against them. Similar bans are being placed on ZTE so Nokia and Ericsson should continue to gain market share. This could also help Samsung, but I feel like their focus is elsewhere as a company. \n\n\u00b7 I\u2019ve kept things fact based up until now and will close with an opinion. Nokia and Ericsson appear to have an establishing duopoly in an industry that the US government has now twice admitted is massively important to the future technological success of all countries. \n\n\u00b7 So much so that they are looking to spend money to try to help US based competitors of Nokia and Ericsson. The new competitors this article mentions are all small and well behind what the tech giants provide. Even with US funding they are not too worrisome. Mavenir seems like the most legitimate threat, but they already have a valuation multiple higher than Nokia and Ericsson. I don\u2019t really see a fund of $750 million dollars split across 5 companies making much of a difference at the end of the day either. \n\n\u00b7 Open RAN may be the future, but that is long ways away. This article suggests that a move to Open RAN in the US will hurt Nokia and Ericsson and help the smaller guys. I do not believe that will be the case. The tech giants will stay ahead of the smaller guys the same way they have done with hardware. And even if they do not the article states that it should make up only 10% of the market by 2021.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Why KPLT is undervalued and overlooked?**\n\nKatapult Holdings (KPLT) is a financing platform that focuses on non-prime, online customers. KPLT is the leading \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service with dirt cheap evaluation and potential to grow. KPLT is very profitable, has quick growth potential, and is trading for much less than its peers.\n\n**Why will KPLT grow?**\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York states that 38% of US consumers are non-prime. That\u2019s a huge market Katapult to grow off of. With Katapult being partnered with merchants like Wayfair, Motorola, Purple, Nectar, and Lenovo, Katapult already has their foot in the door to sell to non-prime consumers.\n\nWhen a consumer fails a prime lending application from companies like Affirm or PayPal, they are passed on to Katapult. Katapult offers them different kinds of payment options depending on what they can afford.\n\n*Katapult is the only nonprime consumer POS lease financing platform focused on e-commerce.*\n\nCurrently, Katapult is the only major non-prime financing platform that is focused primarily online. With Katapult integrated into merchant sites, having very little competition, and open to a large market, it has lots of growth potential.\n\n**KPLT financials**\n\nKatapult approves around 60% of consumers who failed prime lender applications. There is higher risk when dealing with non-prime customers. Fortunately, the company has less than a 3% fraud rate and recovers around 90% of lease costs and charge-offs.\n\n**Earnings**\n\nIn 2019, KPLT earned $92M in revenue. In 2020 they had $250M in revenue. Analysts project more gains in the upcoming years:\n\n\\-2021: $455M\n\n\\-2022: $799M\n\n\\-2023: $1,133M\n\nKPLT earnings seem underwhelming for 2019, but we see lots of growth in 2020 and good projected growth for the upcoming years.\n\nAnother good factor contributing to KPLT growth is the indexed return on leases. In 2019, Katapult lease return improved from 28% to 35%. In 2020, it rose to 40%. Katapult\u2019s earnings will keep growing due to its increased return on leases. The more they squeeze out of their leases, is the more profits and income they\u2019ll net.\n\n**Growth**\n\n\u201cBuy now, Pay later\u201d transactions are gaining much more popularity. Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from $226B in 2021 to $995B by 2026. More than 50% of Americans use BNPL transactions as of March 2021. The BNPL market is growing at a rapid rate. With little competition among non-prime financing platforms, Katapult will skyrocket.\n\nKPLT is expecting $1B in revenue by 2023, and is aggressively expanding its retail partners. KPLT added 26 new retail partners in Q1 and will keep growing its market.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nKPLT is very, very undervalued at a little over $10. Its projected earnings are growing at a rapid rate. With KPLT greatly increasing the amount of retail partners and with the growing BNPL market, Katapult is a great investment that will have lots of return.\n\nI think KPLT should be trading at around $20 or more. Don\u2019t take my word on it, I\u2019m not a financial advisor and you should definitely do some of your own DD. I hope this can bring some awareness to a criminally undervalued stock that hold lots of short and long term profits.",

        "selftext": "Hello degenerates. \n\nI've been looking into the EV market and everyone always says you late to the party or missed the train when buying EV shares (Missing the boat with TESLA etc). Its like the California gold rush in the old times! People rushed out to make money and find gold but the real entrepreneurs made money selling them their shovels, buckets, food and clothes. Electric Vehicles need charging bays, its a  no brainier?!? SO how on gods green earth can BLNK Shares be heavily shorted to 30% and \"Experts\" say this sector should see nothing but growth! \n\nI've done some very basic DD on BLNK. I've always been quite optimistic in this space for electric vehicles and for those that dont know BLNK provides charging solutions for Electric Vehicles. As of December 2020 they had 16, 617 charging stations around the USA but they are one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NYSE. Over 30% short interest. I would hate to know what the outstanding naked short value is. \n\nNow when you look at expected Electric vehicle sales forecasts below:\n\n*\"The US electric vehicles market is expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020\"*\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\nDeloitte even say this sector will continue to boom for the next 10 years.  \"Our global *EV forecast* is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years\"\n\n[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)\n\nAND EVEN FORBES SAYS IT!!! I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging! \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f) \n\n*\u201cWith the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,\u201d the UBS report said.*\n\n*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain\u2019s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .\"*\n\n They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.\n\n## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information\n\nBlink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year.

With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted. I would love to know how many Naked shorts have been placed against a company like this. \n\nI'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions. And just to clarify I am holding shares in BLNK and have been for some time.",

        "selftext": "Hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of theScore's BIGGEST catalyst.\n\nPosition: 1K shares at an avg of $CAD 12.18.\n\nThe stock is traded on the NASDAQ &amp; TSX under ticker: SCR\n\n**Some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.\n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.\n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.\n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore, like all other sports betting companies is currently sitting at a negative EBITDA. They reported a loss of (17.5 M) in the last quarter. This is because we are still in the early days of a high-growth industry. Companies have to get passed all of the free promotions and incentives that are offered, Market entry costs, etc and then they have to retain their users to start seeing profits. They reported a handle of 81,6 million, a 491% YoY increase, with Net gaming revenue being ($2.4M) and a media revenue of $8.0 M, a 17% increase.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**\n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.\n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144).\n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.\n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.\n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** PEOPLE LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories.\n\nLegalization of Canadian Sports betting is expected in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80",

Ultimately, please do your own research. ***Do not take my word for it, you are responsible for your own gains and losses after all.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does Acelarin do?**\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a more effective cancer treatment. It\u2019s based off current chemotherapy treatments, but it has an easier time delivering the anti cancer metabolites. This leads to higher concentrations of it in Tumor cells. I'm not a scientist, so you will need to go to their website to better understand this. Nucana.com\n\n**Notes about Acelarin:**\n\nIt's in a Phase III trial. \n\nIn its Phase I trial it achieved a whopping 217x higher intracellular level of dFdCTP(the anti cancer metabolite) than gemcitabine(the current standard).\n\nIt also stayed in the cells significantly longer. They report 139x greater intracellular AUC of dFdCTP. \n\n**The CEO:**\n\nHugh Griffith (Founder, CEO &amp; Board Member): \n\n28 years in biopharmaceuticals. Chief operating officer of a company bought by Genzyme, now Sanofi. Graduated honours. Inventor of 80 patents, 135 patents pending. Plus held senior positions at AbbVie and Pfizer.\n\n**Other drugs in pipeline:**\n\nI wont go to far into these as these are just icing for longer term potential. You're realistically investing in Acelerin at the moment. \n\nNUC-3373: In Phase 1. Cancer treatment intended to replace 5-FU\n\nNUC-7738 In Phase 1. Another cancer treament in pipeline.\n\nBoth have had results worth looking deeper into. But as I said, I'm currently investing in the potential of Acelerin.\n\n**PRICE:**\n\nAt a 5 year low. $2.93 is it's low point, it is currently 3.06 as I type this.\n\n**Analysts:**\n\n57% Strong Buy\n\n43% Buy\n\nHigh: $22.05, Average: 16.03, Low, 8.02\n\n**Institutions:**\n\nOn the high side. 78.75% ownership, increased 4.60%\n\n**Why is it so low?**\n\nThere was a big share dilution in sept 2020 is my best guess. \n\nCash: 78.6m with a net income of around -35 mil last year.\n\n**Bull Argument:**\n\nIn Phase 3 of a potential game changer for chemotherapy. Had good results in Phase 2.\n\nExcellent, proven leadership.\n\nOther drugs in pipeline are in the same wheelhouse as their current flagship drug Acelerin, so if Acelerin becomes a winner, you may have 2 more winners on your hands.\n\nCost is way down. Perhaps a 5 year low.\n\nHigh institutional ownership.\n\nHigh analyist ratings.\n\nI think that further dilution(if it happens) will easily be offset by general gains, because of the significant improvement it promises over current treatments.\n\nHuge market. 150 billion spent on cancer a year.\n\nVery little short interest.\n\nNot a meme stock, yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear Argument:**\n\nDiluted shares by around 50% recently.\n\nNo revenue yet\n\nMax 2 years of cash. May need to do share dilutions again.\n\nCancer treatment is a common market for bio companies. Lot of competition.\n\nIf Acelerin fails, the company will be in a really bad spot, with low cash on hand and no solid prospects.",

All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.\n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** APES &amp; DEGENERATES LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories. Legalization of Canadian Sports betting in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80",

Share-price declines and a ticking clock to take companies public are ratcheting up the pressure.\n\nThe new challenges for creators of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, result in part from the abundance of the deals that raised money early in 2021. Looming over these firms is a two-year deadline to do a deal or hand back cash to investors. \n\nNow that shares of many SPAC-related companies have fallen, fewer startups are interested in going public through a SPAC. That mismatch is intensifying competition between some blank-check firms for the same private firms, known by some on Wall Street as a \u201cSPAC-off.\u201d\n\nSPACs are shell companies that raise money and list on an exchange with the sole intent of merging with a private firm to take it public. The private company, often a startup, then gets the SPAC\u2019s place in the stock market. Blank-check mergers let companies going public make future business projections\u2014which aren\u2019t allowed in regular IPOs\u2014one reason they took Wall Street by storm this winter and have raised a record $105 billion this year, according to SPAC Research. \n\nBut with SPAC shares in retreat, many blank-check firms now trade below their debut price. Many companies in recent months have said that several different SPACs have asked them about mergers, a trend that contributed to the frenzy in the sector.\n\nThe pressure to execute deals at realistic valuations could get even more intense in the months ahead because nearly 260 blank-check companies with about $87 billion on hand face merger deadlines in the first three months of 2023, according to a Methuselah Advisors analysis of SPAC Research figures. \n\nWhile such deadlines can be extended, they can pressure SPAC teams that often need several months to finish deals and now face turbulent market conditions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is an awful lot of capital sitting there that has to find a home,\u201d said John Chachas, co-managing principal at Methuselah, a boutique investment bank. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a fair number of less-than-desirable deals done just because they have to get done.\u201d\n\nPrivate companies open to SPAC mergers should focus on their business, then begin exploring blank-check options next year, Mr. Chachas said. By then, many SPAC teams could be desperate to finish deals before their deadlines and make generous offers.\u00a0\n\nWith investors retreating in recent weeks from early-stage investments, shares of many companies tied to SPACs\u2014including those taking genetic-testing firm 23andMe Inc., electric-vehicle battery maker Microvast Inc. and flying-taxi startup Joby Aviation public\u2014have fallen about 30% or more since mid-February.  \n\nSigns that regulators are taking a stricter stance on the once-hot sector also have pressured the stocks. Regulatory questions have slowed the timeline for finishing mergers and cut new issuance of blank-check companies to a fraction of the record levels from earlier this year. Just two of the 23 SPACs that announced deals in May are trading above their initial public offering price, figures from data provider SPAC Research show.  \n\nIf no deal is done by the final date\u2014after any extensions\u2014the SPAC creators have to return money to investors and lose what they put in up front to create the shell companies, typically several million dollars for underwriting fees and other expenses. In that scenario, they also don\u2019t get the deeply discounted shares that let them make several times their initial investment, on average.\n\nThose incentives explain why many blank-check mergers will still get done in the months ahead\u2014even if they are completed at lower valuations or the SPAC teams have to give away some of the discounted shares to complete the deals. \n\nBecause of the market reversal, some analysts now expect private companies and investors in SPAC mergers to have more leverage when negotiating deal terms with blank-check firms. The shift shows how many on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are grappling with the unprecedented market environment created by SPACs, which were a rarely used alternative to traditional initial public offerings before late 2020 and are now evolving quickly. \n\n\u201cPeople are getting a lot more choosy,\u201d said Kristi Marvin, founder of data and research provider SPACInsider.\n\nMany investors say smaller SPACs will likely face the most pressure, while the most well known backers such as venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya continue to churn out deals.\n\nBecause investors can typically withdraw at that low IPO price per share, plus a tiny bit of interest, before SPAC mergers are completed, low share prices mean many are likely to do so to eliminate the possibility of taking a loss. That can leave the SPAC with much less money, potentially forcing executives to find other sources of cash or renegotiate some terms of the deal.\n\n\u201cThey are going to have to be more careful with what the valuation is and what they are agreeing to,\u201d said Patrick Galley, a SPAC investor and CEO of RiverNorth Capital Management.\n\nInvestors who put money into SPAC mergers through a fundraising round called a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, could particularly benefit. Large PIPE investors include funds managed by asset management giants BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments Inc. Their money is critical to deals and is added to the cash held by the blank-check company to complete a merger several times as large as the SPAC itself. \n\nIn one sign that PIPE investors could now get better terms, mobile entertainment firm Jam City recently said PIPE investors bought into the company at $8.42 a share in its roughly $1.2 billion SPAC merger, including debt. That is a discounted price unavailable to other investors. \n\nStill, some analysts say momentum in the market could quickly change once again, particularly if some strong deals draw investors back into the space.  \n\n\u201cThree months from now, the market could look very different,\u201d Ms. Marvin said. \u201cIt could be game on again.\u201d",

        "selftext": " Recent IPO for Alfi (ALF) Providing AI Assisted Brand Building and a Marketing SaaS Platform for the Internet and Out of Home Applications  \n   \n**The technology to help brands grow will always be in-demand.

The IPO consisted of 3,731,344 common shares and warrants. The common shares were sold at $4.15 each and the warrants are exercisable at $4.57 each for up to five years.  \n   \nALF shares are trading at a 49% discount from the IPO price. While it\u2019s not unusual for IPO shares to contract after the event, there usually comes an inflection point where the shares begin to gain. We believe ALF shares have reached that point and with a tiny float, these shares could move quickly.  \n   \n**The scope of the AI driven Alfi SaaS product is awe inspiring and may have you saying, \u201cwhat the heck? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\u201d**  \n   \nAlfi is developing an AI enterprise SaaS platform powering computer vision with machine learning models, and deep learning to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time. When a consumer interacts with an ALFI Tablet, Kiosk, or internet content, the software begins a sophisticated AI assisted data capture. The digital device then displays content/advertising relevant to its analysis of the viewer.  \n   \nThe company has provided a\u00a0[brief overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7XTQqUEN2U)\u00a0of the firm's SaaS platform. This video may be a critical part of your due diligence.  \n   \nDigital advertising isn\u2019t new, but Digital out of Home (DOOH) advertising, utilizing AI to generate and report data from consumer interactions is still in its infancy. This niche in advertising is where ALF lives right now.  \n   \nThe market for tracking and reporting on DOOH advertising activity is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2023. Imagine getting into a taxi or a ride share vehicle and there\u2019s an interactive pad on the back of the headrest or going to a mall and interacting with kiosk. This kind of technology will become ubiquitous in the near term, and ALF is one of the leaders and innovators in the sector.  \n   \n**The overall market for digital advertising is $614 billion.**  \n   \nAlf is already reporting positive results in more than 12 separate pilot programs deploying over 1,000 devices and expects to start generating revenues in Q2 and be profitable by Q421. The company plans to have tablets installed in 100,000 ride share vehicles within 4-5 years.  \n   \nThese are the applications ALF wants to deploy both to brands and to businesses to generate revenues:  \n   \nAirports and Malls \u2013 Kiosks  \nTaxis and Rideshares \u2013 Tablets  \nEnterprise Software \u2013 SaaS  \nData Analytics \u2013 Subscriptions  \n   \nAlfi plans to woo ride share drivers and taxis and others with participation in the revenues generated by placing a tablet in their vehicles or locations.  \n   \nUnderstanding the sophistication of the Alfi software may best be understood by their disclaimer statements:  \n   \nALF is compliant with all GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA standards. Alfi\u2019s proprietary Ai algorithm understands small facial cues and perceptual details. The automation works in a way that respects user privacy; without tracking, storing cookies, or using identifiable personal information. The company states it will not store facial images.  \n   \nWe look at ALF as a rare opportunity to get involved in a new IPO with the technology of the future, a future that is starting right now. There may be the potential for a triple digit increase in value here.  \n   \nStay tuned for our full report on ALF.  \n[Disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/recent-ipo-providing-ai-assisted-brand-building?e=[UNIQID])\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Catch me if you can!](https://preview.redd.it/6agncoisqn271.jpg?width=203&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ecbc53ac8b28d3596f164085001d6c2fd877cd)",

        "selftext": " \n\n80% in own of retail investors Currently,\n\nall real stocks (not naked shorts) are counted, and on June 2nd you will know how many naked shorts are in roughly real terms.\n\nRumor has it in the US that it should be between 1 and 2 billion pieces, which would be an empty catastrophe for the hedge funds. If the retail traders keep buying and do not let themselves be unsettled by the massive \"negative\" interference from media such as CNBC, Motley Fool, Fox News as well as moderators such as Jim Cramer or hedge fund manager Rich Greenfield and hold their shares (HODL) , it is possible that the share, as in the VW Shortqueeze 2008 ($ 1,000 per share), will also skyrocket. This is because the hedgies have to cover their short positions.\n\n!!The longer the retail traders hold their shares instead of selling them during the squeeze, the higher the price can rise. At Reddit, where the \"Apes\" exchange ideas, the mood was such that a few months ago they spoke of a possible floor of $ 1,000.!! ((this floor is rly possibre? xD))\n\nDue to the many phenomenal reports from brilliant analysts in the forum, there is now talk of a floor of 10,000 or even 100,000 dollars per share.\n\nThis all sounds completely crazy, but it is not impossible if the investors do not sell too early during a short squeeze. This is exactly what the Hedgies in the USA are terrified of. For a few weeks now, bots have been flooding in, which are intended to unsettle investors and encourage them to sell - via Reddit, Twitter and Youtube.\n\nHardly ever seen on this scale. The trouble is that this doesn't work because the community sticks together so well that the numerous \"ladder attacks\" have no consequences. Now the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) comes into play with its new chairman, Gary Gensler, who had closely observed the game stop process and is now introducing the first changes to the rules of the game for the hedgies, which are supposed to make shorting a lot more difficult . At the recent conference hearing, Gensler mentioned that he wanted to create more fairness and transparency for small investors.\n\nThis is roughly the opposite of what the hedge funds want.\n\nCopied from [https://insideparadeplatz.ch/](https://insideparadeplatz.ch/)",

        "selftext": "Hello there like minded village folk. ;)\n\nI've been looking into the EV market and everyone always says you late to the party or missed the train when buying EV shares (Missing the boat with TESLA etc). Its like the California gold rush in the old times! People rushed out to make money and find gold but the real entrepreneurs made money selling them their shovels, buckets, food and clothes. Electric Vehicles need charging bays, its a  no brainier?!? SO how on gods green earth can BLNK Shares be heavily shorted to 30% and \"Experts\" say this sector should see nothing but growth! \n\nI've done some very basic DD on BLNK. I've always been quite optimistic in this space for electric vehicles and for those that dont know BLNK provides charging solutions for Electric Vehicles. As of December 2020 they had 16, 617 charging stations around the USA but they are one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NYSE. Over 30% short interest. I would hate to know what the outstanding naked short value is. \n\nNow when you look at expected Electric vehicle sales forecasts below:\n\n*\"The US electric vehicles market is expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020\"*\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\nDeloitte even say this sector will continue to boom for the next 10 years.  \"Our global *EV forecast* is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years\"\n\n[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)\n\nAND EVEN FORBES SAYS IT!!! I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging! \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f) \n\n*\u201cWith the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,\u201d the UBS report said.*\n\n*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain\u2019s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .\"*\n\n They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.\n\n## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information\n\nBlink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year. Blink Charging has not formally confirmed its next earnings  publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday,  August 12th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates.\n\nSo in ending for now I cant help but wonder what the hell is going on in the EV charging scene. With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted. I would love to know how many Naked shorts have been placed against a company like this. \n\nI'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust want to see if anyone else can give better insight than me on why this stock is so heavily shorted.",

        "selftext": " Recent IPO for Alfi (ALF) Providing AI Assisted Brand Building and a Marketing SaaS Platform for the Internet and Out of Home Applications  \n   \n**The technology to help brands grow will always be in-demand. This tiny float, newly NASDAQ listed stock could be our next runner.**  \n   \nGood day everyone,  \n   \nWe are initiating coverage of\u00a0**Alfi, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALF),**\u00a0a provider of interactive intelligent artificial intelligence and machine learning software solutions.  \n   \nCurrent price\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $2.83/share  \nOutstanding (est.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12.36M shares  \n**Float (est.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.83M shares**  \n   \nALF\u00a0[closed on its IPO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alfi-inc-announces-closing-initial-163500986.html)\u00a0and began trading on the NASDAQ May 4, 2021. The IPO consisted of 3,731,344 common shares and warrants. The common shares were sold at $4.15 each and the warrants are exercisable at $4.57 each for up to five years.  \n   \nALF shares are trading at a 49% discount from the IPO price. While it\u2019s not unusual for IPO shares to contract after the event, there usually comes an inflection point where the shares begin to gain. We believe ALF shares have reached that point and with a tiny float, these shares could move quickly.  \n   \n**The scope of the AI driven Alfi SaaS product is awe inspiring and may have you saying, \u201cwhat the heck? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\u201d**  \n   \nAlfi is developing an AI enterprise SaaS platform powering computer vision with machine learning models, and deep learning to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time. When a consumer interacts with an ALFI Tablet, Kiosk, or internet content, the software begins a sophisticated AI assisted data capture. The digital device then displays content/advertising relevant to its analysis of the viewer.  \n   \nThe company has provided a\u00a0[brief overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7XTQqUEN2U)\u00a0of the firm's SaaS platform. This video may be a critical part of your due diligence.  \n   \nDigital advertising isn\u2019t new, but Digital out of Home (DOOH) advertising, utilizing AI to generate and report data from consumer interactions is still in its infancy. This niche in advertising is where ALF lives right now.  \n   \nThe market for tracking and reporting on DOOH advertising activity is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2023. Imagine getting into a taxi or a ride share vehicle and there\u2019s an interactive pad on the back of the headrest or going to a mall and interacting with kiosk. This kind of technology will become ubiquitous in the near term, and ALF is one of the leaders and innovators in the sector.  \n   \n**The overall market for digital advertising is $614 billion.**  \n   \nAlf is already reporting positive results in more than 12 separate pilot programs deploying over 1,000 devices and expects to start generating revenues in Q2 and be profitable by Q421. The company plans to have tablets installed in 100,000 ride share vehicles within 4-5 years.  \n   \nThese are the applications ALF wants to deploy both to brands and to businesses to generate revenues:  \n   \nAirports and Malls \u2013 Kiosks  \nTaxis and Rideshares \u2013 Tablets  \nEnterprise Software \u2013 SaaS  \nData Analytics \u2013 Subscriptions  \n   \nAlfi plans to woo ride share drivers and taxis and others with participation in the revenues generated by placing a tablet in their vehicles or locations.  \n   \nUnderstanding the sophistication of the Alfi software may best be understood by their disclaimer statements:  \n   \nALF is compliant with all GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA standards. Alfi\u2019s proprietary Ai algorithm understands small facial cues and perceptual details. The automation works in a way that respects user privacy; without tracking, storing cookies, or using identifiable personal information. The company states it will not store facial images.  \n   \nWe look at ALF as a rare opportunity to get involved in a new IPO with the technology of the future, a future that is starting right now. There may be the potential for a triple digit increase in value here.  \n   \nStay tuned for our full report on ALF.  \n  \n\n[Disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/recent-ipo-providing-ai-assisted-brand-building?e=[UNIQID])",

        "selftext": " Recent IPO for Alfi (ALF) Providing AI Assisted Brand Building and a Marketing SaaS Platform for the Internet and Out of Home Applications  \n   \n**The technology to help brands grow will always be in-demand. This tiny float, newly NASDAQ listed stock could be our next runner.**  \n   \nGood day everyone,  \n   \nWe are initiating coverage of\u00a0**Alfi, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALF),**\u00a0a provider of interactive intelligent artificial intelligence and machine learning software solutions.  \n   \nCurrent price\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $2.83/share  \nOutstanding (est.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12.36M shares  \n**Float (est.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.83M shares**  \n   \nALF\u00a0[closed on its IPO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alfi-inc-announces-closing-initial-163500986.html)\u00a0and began trading on the NASDAQ May 4, 2021. The IPO consisted of 3,731,344 common shares and warrants. The common shares were sold at $4.15 each and the warrants are exercisable at $4.57 each for up to five years.  \n   \nALF shares are trading at a 49% discount from the IPO price. While it\u2019s not unusual for IPO shares to contract after the event, there usually comes an inflection point where the shares begin to gain. We believe ALF shares have reached that point and with a tiny float, these shares could move quickly.  \n   \n**The scope of the AI driven Alfi SaaS product is awe inspiring and may have you saying, \u201cwhat the heck? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\u201d**  \n   \nAlfi is developing an AI enterprise SaaS platform powering computer vision with machine learning models, and deep learning to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time. When a consumer interacts with an ALFI Tablet, Kiosk, or internet content, the software begins a sophisticated AI assisted data capture. The digital device then displays content/advertising relevant to its analysis of the viewer.  \n   \nThe company has provided a\u00a0[brief overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7XTQqUEN2U)\u00a0of the firm's SaaS platform. This video may be a critical part of your due diligence.  \n   \nDigital advertising isn\u2019t new, but Digital out of Home (DOOH) advertising, utilizing AI to generate and report data from consumer interactions is still in its infancy. This niche in advertising is where ALF lives right now.  \n   \nThe market for tracking and reporting on DOOH advertising activity is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2023. Imagine getting into a taxi or a ride share vehicle and there\u2019s an interactive pad on the back of the headrest or going to a mall and interacting with kiosk. This kind of technology will become ubiquitous in the near term, and ALF is one of the leaders and innovators in the sector.  \n   \n**The overall market for digital advertising is $614 billion.**  \n   \nAlf is already reporting positive results in more than 12 separate pilot programs deploying over 1,000 devices and expects to start generating revenues in Q2 and be profitable by Q421. The company plans to have tablets installed in 100,000 ride share vehicles within 4-5 years.  \n   \nThese are the applications ALF wants to deploy both to brands and to businesses to generate revenues:  \n   \nAirports and Malls \u2013 Kiosks  \nTaxis and Rideshares \u2013 Tablets  \nEnterprise Software \u2013 SaaS  \nData Analytics \u2013 Subscriptions  \n   \nAlfi plans to woo ride share drivers and taxis and others with participation in the revenues generated by placing a tablet in their vehicles or locations.  \n   \nUnderstanding the sophistication of the Alfi software may best be understood by their disclaimer statements:  \n   \nALF is compliant with all GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA standards. Alfi\u2019s proprietary Ai algorithm understands small facial cues and perceptual details. The automation works in a way that respects user privacy; without tracking, storing cookies, or using identifiable personal information. The company states it will not store facial images.  \n   \nWe look at ALF as a rare opportunity to get involved in a new IPO with the technology of the future, a future that is starting right now. There may be the potential for a triple digit increase in value here.  \n   \nStay tuned for our full report on ALF.\n\n[Disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/recent-ipo-providing-ai-assisted-brand-building?e=[UNIQID])\n\n  \n  \n\n[NASDAQ: ALF](https://preview.redd.it/9yuq4rpbqn271.jpg?width=203&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2618e20db56127653251b8a600e601f92b163741)",

        "selftext": "Hello community,  \n\n\nEnlivex Therapeutics (ENLV) is a Israeli pharmaceutical company that is targeting the Sepsis market (33B of untapped potential). They have been developing the drug since 2019 and it turned that the pandemic was the perfect storm for them. Because COVID-19, governments were willing to give emergency approval to drugs that were able to help COVID patients. Well, Enlivex's drug Allocetra, which delivers immune rebalancing therapy, turns out to also aid critical patients that have COVID-19. The company has received patients from three of the biggest Sepsis markets (US,Japan, and today Canada) while simultaneously (and silently) partnering with Brazil, India, and the UK for Enlivex clinical trials. Their past trials got amazing grades and I believe that this is the beginning of a long and amazing rollercoaster ride.  \n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/enlv](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/enlv)  \n\n\nYour Welcome Boys.  \nNOW FEAST!",

        "selftext": "Pembina Pipeline Corp. has struck a  friendly deal to acquire Inter Pipeline Ltd. for $8.3 billion in an  all-share deal after the midstream company was put in play earlier this  year.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, shareholders of Inter Pipeline will  receive half a share of Pembina for each share held, valuing the deal at  $19.45 per share based on the most recent closing price. That trumps  the unsolicited $16.50 offer from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP  that Inter Pipeline rebuffed earlier this year. According to the release  issued Tuesday, Pembina\u2019s executive team will lead the combined entity,  while Inter Pipeline will have representation on the board of  directors.\n\nInter Pipeline Chair Margaret McKenzie said the deal with Pembina  represented the best value for shareholders after the company launched a  strategic review in February.\n\n\u201cIt was evident that a combination with Pembina offered compelling  value for Inter Pipeline shareholders in the short-term, as well as the  opportunity to participate in the upside of \\[the Heartland Petrochemical  Complex\\] and the combined business longer-term,\u201d she said in the  release.\n\n\u201cThe creation of a more highly integrated business across the energy  infrastructure value chain results in a combined entity that is greater  than the sum of its parts.\u201d\n\nThat Heartland Petrochemical Complex has been key to Inter Pipeline\u2019s  path forward, with the project outside Edmonton slated to produce  525,000 tonnes of polypropylene per year upon completion. However, it  has been dogged by contruction delays and cost overruns, and is now  expected to commence production in early 2022.\n\nThe two companies said their friendly transaction is expected to  close in the fourth quarter of this year, pending all necessary  approvals.\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pembina-strikes-8-3b-all-stock-deal-for-inter-pipeline-1.1611131](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pembina-strikes-8-3b-all-stock-deal-for-inter-pipeline-1.1611131)",

        "selftext": "Analysis on AMC:\n\nI will probably get downvoted for this, however I still feel the need to write this as most people here dont understand what is really going on with AMC and most of the DD that I have seen are basically just hype train or regurgitated information they got from a youtube or a reddit post, who also got their information this way, creating a cycle of misleading analysis .  \n\n1.  AMC is not a short squeeze but a gamma squeeze.  You can tell easily who has option experience and who is brand new to the scene, just from this statement alone.  A gamma squeeze is triggered when there are so alot of call options being bought, which forces the market makers to hedge by buying shares of amc.  Which then moves the price of the stock up.  However once the stock price reaches a certain price, market makers do not have to hedge by buying the stock as they now have enough shares.  What they normally do at this point is to sell more call optoins using a covered call.  A covered call is when you sell option contracts using the shares you have.  This basically means that market makers are not losing money, but in fact making bank.  A covered call is basically a hack, where you short delta, but you come out ahead financially, unless the stock price moves below where you bought it from, minus the premiums you collected.  The other critical point regarding market makers and gamma squeezes, is that once the Iv spikes, they can sell very very far otm call options and DO NOT HAVE TO HEDGE.  As those OTM (out of the money) options becoming ITM (in the money) are basically mathmaticlaly so low, market makers will not hedge those $60 strike call options.  No matter how many you buy.\n2. Wall street is not losing money on AMC as many of you seem to think.  Some of the hedge funds who shorted early will temporarilly lose money on UNREALISED GAINS.  This is not the same thing as taking actual losses.  There is a huge difference between the two.\n3. Most of the shorts came in at much higher strike prices (most shorted from $18-$20 back in march).  The same as most of you probably came in at the higher stock price and not the $2 it was trading at.  The new shorts are also shorting from a higher level due to the run up and the old shorts can cost average thier short position. Cost average is when you buy a stock at either a higher or lower price to average down your cost.\n4. AMC is different then GME.  AMC has a much bigger float and the chance of a short squeeze is much lower compared to GME. GME you could logically make a case for it due to the smaller float size and also new leadership turning GME into a winner.\n5. The media reports what will get it clicks and views.  The same as youtube.  Which is why they are running with headlines such as \"AMC short sellers dealt massive 1.2 billion dollar losses\".  Most youtubers, including the stock market channels do not have much experience or knowledge.  There are some very legit ones, but most of the channels are trash.  The blind leading the blind.\n6. On a fundamentals perspective AMC is not worth more then $2-$5 dollars, even with the re-opening.  AMC was managed poorly and in bad financial shape PRE PANDEMIC.  Now those financial are even worse as they are still liable for the debt from leases.  Which also brings me to another point.  AMC does not own most of thier locations.  Which means they dont even have any assets of value besides the brand \"AMC\".\n7. The value of AMC will be tied to what another buyer is willing to pay for AMC.  As long as the hype train is there, you can find a buyer, but the last guys holding the bag will be looking at a long career behind wendy's giving blowjobs and not as a side hustle to invest more into amc. If you are new, this is known as a pump and dump.  This is not something new to the stock market.  It has been going on for decades.  Normally this is done on low float stocks such as penny stocks. \n\nThis is a long read, but I hope you got the hard truth about AMC.  Im not saying dont invest in amc, all im saying is know the truth before making any plays.  BTW for full disclosure.  I do make plays on AMC and other meme stocks on the call side. So I've definitley made money playing amc and other meme stocks but I also locked in my gains and only make plays when its breaking resistance or have big buy volume comming in for a momentum play.",

They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.   \n \n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month. \n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs, while increasing bettor retention rates in an industry that is renowned for not having user loyalty. \n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?** \n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier. \n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.   \n\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.  \n \n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144). \n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.   \n \n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million  \n 15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million  \n 20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.  \n \n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** APES LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS**.** SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories. Legalization of Canadian Sports betting in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
