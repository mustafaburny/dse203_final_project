        "selftext": "Robinhood is lending your shares to shorters. Don't believe me? \n\nHow's about this, from Reuters, yesterday: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-robinhood-securitiesle-idUSKCN2AU2EP\n\nBut you have margin turned off! But you have a sell limit set for $69,420.69! IT DOESN'T MATTER. \n\nINSTANT SETTLEMENTS is what needs to be TURNED OFF. They even hide it away, under profile&gt;menu&gt;investing&gt;DAY TRADE SETTINGS. \n\nOn top of that, THEY DO NOT LET YOU TURN IT OFF IF YOU HAVE ANY PENDING DEPOSITS OR HAVE TRADED IN THE LAST 3 DAYS. \n\nThat's the cost of instant settlements. Sure, you get to trade quicker, but you also allow them to trade AGAINST you, and WITH YOUR OWN SHARES.\n\nCan't turn off instant settlements, don't want to be stuck in limbo for a full brokerage transfer, and determined to escape? What can be done?\n\nWell, my fellow smooth-brained ape, I'll tell you what I'm doing:\n\nThe following steps assume you are invested primarily in shares of a company, not options. EACH OF THESE STEPS WILL TAKE TIME TO PROCESS, SO PLAN ACCORDINGLY.\n\nFirst, open an account at a different brokerage. Make sure it's a cash-account (for some brokerages, like WeBull, etc., YOU MUST OPT-OUT OF SHARE LENDING). With a cash-account, you'll have to sit patiently for settlement of funds from selling shares before you can withdraw those funds or reinvest (but, let's be honest, you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't already patient). I use Fidelity, which is a cash-account by default with several opt-in programs to take advantage of down the line. \n\nSecond, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, transfer/deposit money into your new brokerage from your bank (or wherever else you usually get your money to trade with). If GME is your sole play, and you can afford it, try to deposit around the same amount your GME shares in Robinhood are currently worth. \n\nOnce your deposit is completed (no longer \"pending\"), wait for a small dip in the price and buy in with your new broker. \n\nWhen the purchase is complete, you can go into Robinhood and sell your shares (ideally, at the same or slightly higher price than you just bought them for at your new brokerage).\n\nWait out the next few trading days of your Robinhood account and DO NOT TRADE VIA ROBINHOOD. If you trade, you risk resetting the clock on your Withdrawable Cash. You do your trading with your new brokerage from now on. Withdraw your cash from Robinhood ASAP and put it back in your bank account, pay back your wife's boyfriend, or whatever.\n\nNow, if Robinhood wants to keep any short deals they had on your shares, THEY have to hold onto the shares, themselves. Every 1 share you were holding away from shorters (ineffectively), has now become 2 shares (1 effectively, 1 ineffectively). That, or Robinhood actually does sell the shares, which increases the length of the short chain and the costs associated with holding that position.. Thus, shorting attempts are made more expensive and less sustainable. \n\nMeanwhile, you'll be back to holding your shares without your broker selling them behind your back. \n\nTLDR: Don't let your diamond hands be sold by the pawn shop that's storing them. Getting out of Robinhood not only helps you, but also hinders the shorts. Two birds with one stone. Power to the players.\n\nObligatory, not financial advice, not an adviser or professional, do your own research, yadayada. \n\nIf I'm wrong about anything in the above, do not be surprised, but please let me know what it might be. If my foundation is rotted, please kick my case over before anyone even considers moving in. Thanks.",

[This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. \"China\u2019s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth\u201481 percent said they trade at least once a month\" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)\n\n*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:\n\nA graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)\n\nThe above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. &amp; if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|5|730k shares|\n|1|10|1.46m shares|\n|5|5|3.65m shares|\n|5|10|7.3m shares|\n|10|5|7.3m shares|\n|10|10|14.6m shares|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.\n\n\"The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.nasdaq.com\\/articles\\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https://preview.redd.it/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)\n\nIt appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*\n\nSo why does retail \"not control the market\" ?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.\n\n1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.\n2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for \"power\" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.\n\nI know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.",

        "selftext": "The last year was tough. I've got a kid to feed, you know. So I've been here looking to make some money alongside the rest of you apes, and I was willing to take the risk. When GME dropped to less than 50 only a week after record highs, I knew things were not over. So I bought in and have been happily watching the gains these past few weeks.\n\nThing is, I wanted more. With the price so high, I was looking at Options. I was looking at GME a week ago. It was trading at 138. I went to buy a Call Option at 40 with a strike price of 140. Let's say I sold it at a price of 280. That option would have been 10k in the money! Unfortunately I have to say \"would have been\" because I did not buy that option. Not because I didn't want to, but because I wasn't ALLOWED to do so. What gives? The little guy can't get access to real trading strategies? Wall Street has to screw us over like that?\n\nI mean hey, I understand having to ask for approval first. Accept the risks and all that. So fine, I did that. Robinhood gave me a big FU. Fidelity, which has been my brokerage app, said I needed to wait a few days. On Friday I was told I got approved. Awesome. All good now, right? OF COURSE NOT! I'm a little guy, so the only position I am entitled to is being screwed.\n\nThis week I decided to start small, grab a Call on AMC with a strike price of 12. The price just hit 14, so that option was about 2k in the money. Nice start. Needless to say, I went to buy the option and was denied. Oh sure, I had been approved for options trading. Buy only at Level 1, which paradoxically doesn't allow you to actually buy options. Does that make sense to anyone? Don't ask me for experience, assholes. You're creating a Catch-22. How can I ever get experience if you won't let me try?\n\nIs it fair to say Wall Street has been quite literally taking food out of my kid's mouth? Because I think that's fair to say. Maybe you agree that it should be difficult to get approved for options trading. That opinion is incompatible with a YOLO play, so get out of here. If anyone knows a place with enough integrity to give the little guy a chance, I would love to know. I deserve a chance to learn.",

        "selftext": " **Understanding the SPAC Market**\n\nIn the long run, markets are efficient. In the short run, there are massive dislocations in markets caused by structural changes, behavioral effects, and positioning that cause short term inefficiencies. The SPAC market has shown a considerable amount of inefficiency for the past 12 months which has allowed investors to generate tremendous profits on a nearly \u201crisk free\u201d basis (or more accurately, an abnormally high level of profits with exceptionally low levels of risk).\n\nSpecifically, investors could buy pre-merger SPACs at, near, or below their $10 NAV levels, and then generate 50%+ profits when those companies announced a pending deal (definitive agreement). The holding periods of these investments would range from weeks to months, leading to annual returns in excess of 100%.\n\nThis short run inefficiency no longer exists and will not return in any substantial way. To understand why, you need to understand and examine the circumstances leading up to the past twelve months that created the inefficiency, and the market reaction that has occurred in order to correct this inefficiency.\n\n**The \u201cold\u201d SPAC market**\n\nPrior to 2020, the SPAC market was a tiny part of the overall equity issuance world. The first reason for this is signaling- SPACs were viewed as a \u201cshady\u201d way of going public. Institutional investors would typically see a company going public via SPAC as damaged goods \u201cIf the company was any good, it would do a traditional IPO\u201d- at least that\u2019s the message all of Goldman, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley bankers kept parroting. This resulted in SPAC companies being ignored by institutional investors, which makes it hard for a company to attract capital, build an investor and liquidity base, etc. To add insult to injury, bankers write sell-side research (Goldman Sachs initiatives coverage on XYZ Company with $45 price target) as a quid-pro-quo for investment banking business (read: IPO and other issuance fees). If you go public via SPAC, most of the big banks won\u2019t publish research about you, institutional investors will shun you, and you\u2019re going to have a hard time. As a self-fulfilling prophecy, good companies were steered away from SPAC deals, so only a handful of \u201cless good\u201d companies went public via SPAC, and those companies inevitably didn\u2019t perform well on public markets, cementing the past 10 years of data showing \u201cSPAC companies generate poor returns on public markets.\u201d\n\n**The \u201cold\u201d SPAC trade**\n\nDespite this, there was a bit of a funny \u201cglitch\u201d in the SPAC market. The idea that investors could redeem their shares for the original NAV value, plus accrued interest (held in risk free treasury bills), and also get a free warrant (or partial warrant).\n\nTo astute institutional investors, they could buy SPAC IPO units at $10, get a warrant (which they could turn around and sell), and then redeem their $10 share for \\~10.40 after two years (assuming 2% interest rates). For these same investors, who regularly hold billions of dollars of treasuries, re-allocating some of their treasury-allocation to SPACs provides a basically strictly-dominant return (with a liquidity trade-off, you can\u2019t sell blocks of pre-DA SPACs very easily).\n\nLarge pension funds and other institutional investors had incredibly simple strategies. Blindly buy SPACs at $10, sell the warrant for whatever price you can, redeem the stock for $10 and you\u2019re ahead. What\u2019s interesting is that the \u201calpha\u201d in this trade came from the liquidity in the warrant and desperately trying to sell it. Consider that for the last decade, many SPAC deals never traded above $11. Not before the DA, not after the DESPAC, literally never. Trying to sell 2 Million warrants at 80 cents each into a market that trades 5000 warrants a day, is a non-trivial problem (especially when there\u2019s four other funds also trying to sell 2M warrants). \u201cWhat do we do if the stock goes up to $15 or $20 pre-DA\u201d wasn\u2019t a question, because it essentially never happened. That\u2019s also why pre 2020, the average amount of redemptions was around 50% of all capital invested.\n\n[Here\u2019s a graph from spacresearch.com](https://i.imgur.com/KDEEld5.png) that shows deals from 2015-2018 and you can see that only 1 deal was trading above $15.\n\nOkay, to summarize the most important point of this section, it\u2019s the fact that SPAC IPO investors (the ones buying units at $10.00), are interested in selling the warrants whenever they can, at any price, and their primary plan is to hold the stock to the deal and redeem it. Selling the stock before the DA isn\u2019t a major concern of theirs. I stress that this is all pre-2020 (many readers are unaware of the SPAC market before 2020, so this all sounds very unintuitive to them).\n\n**DraftKings changed everything**\n\nThe exact reason why Draftkings went public via SPAC isn\u2019t officially stated (most speculate it\u2019s because they operate in a fuzzy legal area with respect to sports betting and fantasy sports), but ultimately they announced/leaked the deal on Dec 23, 2019. On that date, original SPAC investors laughed all the way to the bank, and they sold as many shares as they could, for a whopping $10.80 representing an 8% return over NAV. This was \u201ca big DA pop\u201d back in those days. On that same first day of trading, 10M shares traded- which at the time was also a ton of shares to trade for a SPAC announcement (in 2021, we regularly see 50M shares trade on the DA day).\n\nWhat happened in the ensuing weeks, has basically never happened in the history of SPACs. A torrent of retail interest came to buy shares of DKNG pushing the stock price to $18 in the next 5 weeks. The reason for this is that Draftkings was an extremely well-known retail \u201chousehold\u201d name and offered a pure-play in the fantasy sports/betting business (also note this was pre-covid). Now to be clear, this \u201ctorrent of retail interest\u201d, on a relative basis was still tiny compared to what we see in the 2021 SPAC market. But ultimately, there wasn\u2019t a large supply of shares in the market. While some SPAC institutional investors sold aggressively for prices they\u2019d never dreamed of, many simply held out (I posit that holding was less of a strategy, and more of a residual of not caring and not having a plan in place to do anything other than redeem or sell on the deSPAC date).\n\n**Draftkings had some luck, but also did everything right\u2026**\n\nThe COVID tailwind in February/March ultimately helped propel interest in DKNG and the stock climbed. This created a strange situation where institutional investors were suddenly caught significantly under-allocated in a business that they wanted/needed to have as part of their portfolio. A large institution like Fidelity/DE Shaw/Blackrock etc. will typically get \u201cfirst look\u201d at all companies in the IPO process and sign up for blocks of 2, 5, 10 million shares when the company IPOs. Virtually overnight, a $10 Billion dollar business that was highly sensitive to the COVID/Sports market was public and they needed huge amounts of shares. Buying large blocks of the stock wasn\u2019t feasible on the open market because the float of the stock was still tiny (The SPAC shares were floating, but most insider and early investor, PIPE shares were still locked up). DKNG made the smart move to hire the same investment bankers that they originally circumvented in the IPO process, to do multiple secondary offerings into the market. This allowed the bankers to collect 5% fees on hundreds of millions of dollars of shares (issued by the company and also sold by insiders), and crucially, got DKNG a ton of coverage from sell-side banks initiating price targets. While the company started as a SPAC, they quickly caught up with the \u201ctypical institutional flow\u201d of a traditional public company.\n\n**The follow-up...**\n\nDraftkings was crucial for a few reasons. Most importantly, it added legitimacy to the SPAC process, which paved the way for other high-quality companies to feel comfortable with going public via SPAC. In a very close second, DKNG whet the retail appetite for SPACs. Many retail investors started going on the hunt for \u201cthe next Draft Kings\u201d, and we saw record amounts of retail interest in SPACs in 2020. To be fair, there was record amounts of retail interest in stock markets overall in 2020 during COVID, but the relative amount of interest (pre and post covid) was dramatically higher in SPACs. If investors are looking for \u201cthe next Draft Kings SPAC\u201d, and also looking for \u201cthe next Tesla\u201d, the obvious intersection of that ends up being NKLA, HYLN, QS, etc.\n\nMore or less any SPAC that announced a deal in 2020 showed massive gains due to a lack of institutional sellers (the passive strategy from pre 2020 days) and immense retail interest concentrated on a very low number of deals.\n\n**Where we are today\u2026**\n\nIn 2021, a dozen new deals are being announced every single week. There simply isn\u2019t enough \u201cretail money\u201d to plow into these deals with significant interest/liquidity to push these stocks up from $10 to $15, $20, $25 like what was happening in late 2020. To make matters more difficult, the nature of the institutional investors has changed as well.\n\nThe sleepy, quiet, traditional, SPAC investors of the past decade have been replaced by hedge funds. These hedge funds have seen the \u201cDA Pop\u201d effects and realize they can generate immense returns at nearly risk-free levels, and aggressively buy the SPAC IPO shares with the intention on selling every DA POP indiscriminately.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for this, if a hedge fund can by a $10 unit (which is virtually risk free), and sell the stock+warrant for $12+ on the DA announcement, they\u2019re generating a 20%+ risk free return. This, with leverage, is far better than generating a 50%, or 75%, or even 100% return that has significantly higher risk (holding the company and hoping enough retail interest comes to push the stock higher).\n\nThis is the logical consequence of markets being competitive and efficient. Clever retail investors ([r/spacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacs)!) generated abnormal, excess returns for the past 9 months and smart (large) hedge fund money has copied the strategy and crowded out the retail money.\n\n**Putting it all together\u2026**\n\nJust to recap with simplified numbers, in 2020 there were about 20 SPAC deals, and only about 25-50% of institutional investors aggressively sold their shares on a DA pop. With say, a Billion dollars of retail money (demand) plowing into these deals, we saw the stocks pop to $20+ on a regularly basis (or $100+ in the case of QS).\n\nIn 2021, there are nearly 100 SPAC deals (over 3 months), and 75% of institutional investors are hedge funds that are aggressively selling their shares on the DA pop. With these hand-waivey numbers, unless there is 10x the amount of retail demand pouring into the market, we can\u2019t/won\u2019t see the same market pops.\n\nMore importantly, (and critically), we shouldn\u2019t be seeing these DA pops and all of this is consistent with what we expect to see from a market becoming smarter and more efficient over time.\n\n**But I pick good Management Teams\u2026..**\n\nIt generally doesn\u2019t matter, because there are so many SPACs chasing a limited number of targets, and the SPAC deal makers don\u2019t bring much to the table other than cash (which is the same regardless of who you deal with). The only reason a SPAC should have a \u201cDA Pop\u201d is because the deal has been mispriced (the company agreed to do the deal at too low of a price). If a CEO wants to do a SPAC deal, they can just run a competitive process (bidding war) and find whoever is willing to give them the highest valuation (which is great for the company, bad for the SPAC shareholders hoping to make a quick buck). This significantly reduces the chance that the deal will be mispriced, which reduces the chance of the DA pop. If a CEO wants to underprice to get a DA pop, they can run a traditional IPO.\n\nTo summarize the effects again:\n\n1. Retail capital chasing DA\u2019s is diluted across many more deals, giving each one less of a DA pop due to fewer people buying DA\u2019s.\n2. Institutional capital is aggressively selling DA\u2019s since it\u2019s an arbitrage trade for them, adding to the supply of shares being sold on the DA.\n3. Deals are priced more competitively since there\u2019s many SPAC sponsors chasing the same deals.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly important to understand that these 3 factors weren\u2019t in play in 2020, and that\u2019s why the trades worked. If you made a ton in 2020, congrats for being smart and early. If you think you can repeat the performance in 2021, I have very bad news for you.\n\n**So\u2026 what\u2019s next, how do I make money?**\n\nI noted above that SPAC deals are competitive and typically will close at the highest valuation. I\u2019ll follow up by saying that I am very confident that the highest valuation is not the correct valuation. In most cases, it will be too high (meaning the stocks will, on average, perform poorly in the future), and in other cases it will be too low (meaning the stocks will do well in the future). Due to the aforementioned liquidity mechanics that I highlighted above, even if it\u2019s a \u201cgood deal, at a great valuation.\u201d, the DA pops are being sold indiscriminately by hedge funds creating opportunities for investors to be investing in great companies at great prices. The very mechanics that have closed one market inefficiency (trading the DA pop), has created a new one (investing in great companies that deserve higher prices). That being said, the latter is an investing strategy that is extremely difficult to get right because it literally just resembles standard investing (buy good companies at good valuations). This is very different than \u201cI buy SPACs at NAV and make 50%+ annual returns, this will obviously work forever, and I am a genius.\u201d\n\n**More thoughts to follow...**\n\nSorry this has the wrong flair, I can't use the discussion one as a lowly spacling :(",

If so, what are they? To my understanding, VOO has no commission on any of those platforms, and Charles Schwab is considered the best banking brokerage. I'm strongly considering this for her, since she won't be trading much at all in this scenario. Please let me know any further details you might know.\n\nSecondly, we are considering using a private fund manager. I understand over these longer periods, most funds don't beat the SP500, and they're probably realizing your gains and not taking advantage of the reduced tax on long term capital gains. So what are the advantages for her in this situation? I'd imagine they can beat the SP500 when things aren't as bullish as they have been--is that true? If so, that might sway our decision toward them. I know you can't predict a crash, but the market is certainly due for a correction, and maybe reallocating out of the SP500 would hedge some losses there.\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated!",

The company Tweeted an Attorney Letter will follow suit soon, which allows this company to **uplist to Pink Current status**. Pink Current status enables them to trade without restrictions and attracts a large number of new shareholders. This uplist will also enable the company to officially press release a new acquisition in the Public Safety Technology sector. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is ILUS International?**\n\nILUS International is a roll-up company with acquisition targets in the Public Safety Technology sector. The former ILUS ticker was a shell and this company is in no way representative of the old company, a name change from Illustrato Pictures to ILUS International is expected soon. Their first acquisition was  [FireBug Group in January of this year.](https://www.issuewire.com/otcilus-acquires-fb-technologies-a-global-technology-company-in-the-fire-rescue-market-appoints-new-ceo-board-1689936822558881) They also swiftly acquired E-Raptor and TVC as well. \n\n**FireBug Group** specializes in mist nozzle technology, vehicle conversion, autonomous fire safety drones, and water conservation. FireBug products are already being used in the UK, India, UAE, and various emerging markets internationally. The company plans to expand to the US this year. \n\n**E-Raptor** makes 6-wheel fully electrical utility vehicles built for rugged terrain. It can be ordered fully customizable and can be equipped with FireBug technology. \n\n**TVC** also known as The Vehicle Converters list customers including US military, Amazon, KFC, Apple, Jumeirah Hotels and Resorts, and many more. (Customer list can be viewed on website linked above) This company is based in Dubai and is also a **major provider of ambulances in the UAE.**\n\n**CEO Nick Link** is the CEO of FireBug Group and became CEO of ILUS International as well following the acquisition. **Nick owns 360 million common shares of ILUS.** Nick originally founded Jewel Saffire Products Ltd. in 2003 which was a fire safety equipment company. With this company, Nick began creating mist technology based products. Nick left the company in 2011 and founded FireBug Group in 2013. With FireBug, Nick wanted to focus more on fire safety innovations and technology, rather than the crowded space of standard equipment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* Pink Current uplist\n* New acquisition(s) announced (company has one more confirmed, 8 being DD'd currently)\n* OTCQB Uplist (Fins are getting audited, price has held over a cent)\n* Share buyback discussed by CEO\n* Nasdaq uplist (Company has stated this is their goal)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Detego Digital Forensics - Possible Next Acquisition**\n\n* [Website](https://www.mcmsolutions.co.uk/)\n* End-to-end digital forensics platform used by international militaries, intelligence agencies, and police.\n* Director John Paul Backwell is also the Director for ILUS International\n* Endorsed by UK Chief of Police as the best digital forensics platform.\n* Backwell has stated the company's intend to work together closely in the near future. Screenshot of the statement can be found in the DD document on page 11.\n\nILUS International has a clear mission to be at the center of innovation in the public safety sector. With a good share structure, experienced management, real products and revenue, and Nasdaq goals, I expect this company to see serious price action beginning soon as it becomes Pink Current and a positive trend for many weeks/months to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Brokers that restrict stop sign trading such as Fidelity will not allow you to trade this stock until it is officially Pink Current, which should be in a week or two. Common brokers that do allow trading of stop sign stops include TD Ameritrade, Etrade, and Schwab.**",

Institutions got lazy and let this thing slipway past where it should have gotten. No retail investor is long on fucking SEAS.\n\nIn other words, if take your \ud83d\udca9 and make it look like a [chocolate bar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Caramel-Bar.jpg), no one will be any the wiser as long as they don't get close enough to sniff.\n\nSeriously, there is no bull argument at all for this being about $20, and this stock is starting to *stink*. \n\nCheck out this article: [SeaWorld attendance dives 53% in the final quarter of 2020, but stock soars](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-seaworld-earnings-covid-rebound-20210225-fs7wmwm3zrh7jlzwm5qdsbdz7y-story.html)\n\nA small dip in the fake momentum and this thing comes **tumbling down**.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*But what about the cute killer whales? I'm not evil!*\n\nWatch Blackfish. It would be doing them a favor if SeaWorld was bankrupt.\n\nEven without that knowledge, the company itself is run by some really scummy individuals. \n\nThe starting wage at SeaWorld Orlando is current $11 an hour. Instead of raising the minimum wage, the CEO plans to \"increase automation efforts overtime\" to solve their cost problems. Not only are your Orca's being kept in a cage, but they also won't even pay the people to take care of them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*But we only know how to get tendies with *undervalued* stocks!*\n\nIndeed young one, but everyone can learn. The bold get the tendies. \n\nYou usually need to apply to get shorting approved on your margin account. Fidelity has a pretty quick turnaround time, so if SEAS is still above $40 by the time you get approved it can be a great play to make.\n\nThere is a lot of benefit to having at least one \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b position in your portfolio. Probably even more than one (explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxf7y0/whats_happening_with_the_bond_market_or_how_i/))\n\nLong puts work too, but I recommend shorting since it is less a question of *if* and more of a question of *when* the stock tanks. Even bankruptcy is not out of the question as /u/cyphonismus explained in his DD.\n\nThere is a reason hedgies love it.\n\n**TL:DR** - short SEAS, use premium to buy more GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Fidelity just approved me a few days ago.  I have levels 1 &amp; 2; can buy puts and calls as well as sell cash/stock secured options.  If you're interested I would call your 401k bank and see if you can apply.\n\n\n**Details to apply with Fidelity:**\n\nI am an active emoloyee, still contributing, no rollover or anything.\n\nIt is my Fidelity managed brokerage link.\nThe web interface wouldn't let me apply with a 401k directly, I could apply for my HSA online.  Originally Fidelity told me you couldn't apply.  Later a more experienced Fidelity rep confirmed it is possible, you just have to fill out the paperwork manually and send them a secure message.  Fidelity can tell you how to get the form and send the secure message.  I just called their 401k customer service number.\nI believe the options application was under all forms, page 8.  Your max options level is company/plan dependent.\n\nIt tools 4-5 weeks to process since they're backed up.  I also originally digitally signed it and a newer rep said that was no good, which is apparently inaccurate.  I then physically signed and secure emailed (as well as faxed) it to them 2 weeks ago to keep it moving quickly.  Approval came in Friday night.\n\nIf you apply I would recommend physically signing whatever you upload and sending it via secure message.  You can mail it, but that would take even longer.\n\n\n**My thoughts:**\n\nSome people think using options at all in a 401k is a bad idea, I disagree since I plan to be careful and open mostly low risk trades.  Having more choices is always better IMO.  I'll \"buy\" stock by selling puts and sell covered calls on stocks I own.  I'll also sell CSP with the intent they expire worthless / wheel them.  I really wish I could do PMCCs, but my employer doesn't allow that.  \nI'm going to make rules for portfolio breakdown of LEAPS calls, normal written puts, and more aggressive written puts.\n\nThis is only a portion of my 401k.  I still have a large chunk of S&amp;amp;P, a couple indexes, and some boomer managed fund.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I posted a [$17k yolo on ZNGA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw3ts3/17k_yolo_znga/) and bumped it up to $27k total yesterday.\n\nWhile everyone was crying about the market taking a shit and RKT crashing ([I was crying too](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx7mlz/rkt_12k_114k_17k/)) it was announced ZNGA acquired a game studio, [Echtra Games](https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/03/zynga-acquires-diablo-co-creators-echtra-games-in-expansion-to-pc-and-consoles/), whose creator and his team played a pivital role in Diablo/Diablo II. They were acquired with the goal to help Zynga move into PC/cross-platform game play. I think this is a promising acquisition with lots of future potential and is just [one of many planned for this year](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/).\n\nThe CEO of Zynga also spoke at a conference with Morgan Stanley today. Below are some excerpts he said during the call that I found interesting .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Well known established global IP + data driven iteration + proven game mechanics =** \ud83d\ude80\n\n&gt;We like to learn from what we've done before. And in the case of Harry Potter that was a big element of it. One of the things that we learned was we needed an intellectual property in a world that was appealing to a much larger audience and a much more global audience, so that a lot of the cool game play features that we had could reach a bigger audience. So we combined a new IP with some proven mechanics that we'd been messing around with. And then we tested it for a very long period of time and test markets. That's really the structural difference between mobile and console.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In mobile, you can really test market something to remove a lot of the introduction risk. And so with Harry Potter that was something that we did as we went into whether it was Australia or Canada, we were testing very specific elements of what makes for a successful game. Does it retain? Does it engage? What's the conversion rates? Does the UA scale against what the cost of acquisition is? And so, we thoroughly put Harry Potter through its test marketing phases. And what we're really excited about was first and foremost the reception from fans was phenomenal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We saw - the ratings were very strong. The Harry Potter fans were raving about it. It went really viral. We did some fun stuff with Zayn Malik. And it really had really a lot of nice momentum out of the launch. But then when it started to hit weeks 14, 30 and beyond, all the testing that we had done about what were the retention rates engagements, we were exceeding them. So it was actually really positive to see that the test marketing worked and that was a critical part of the success here.\n\nThe Harry Potter IP is a money machine. If you can integrate the game mechanics that get people to continually make micro transactions, or spend hours playing, combined with a raving fan base of an established global IP, imo this is going to print money for them.\n\nThe Harry Potter game was [launched on Sep/23](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-launches-harry-potter-puzzles-spells-worldwide). I think we could see a lift in revenue in the coming quarters from this game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2 Upcoming Game Releases in the First Half**\n\nThey're targeting 2 new game releases in the first half \"Puzzle Combat\" and \"FarmVille 3\".\n\n**On Puzzle Combat**\n\n&gt;So as we think about releasing Puzzle Combat in the first half, I wouldn't necessarily set the expectations that this is a theatrical movie model where it's - a Marvel movie that comes out at summer and it's got this huge spike. That's not at all the model here, right. We're in this for the long-term. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And so, we're going to be releasing the game, see how it settles in and then very methodically start acquiring based on what we're seeing in the dynamics and the metrics.\n\n**On FarmVille**\n\n&gt;And, there are a lot of fans that have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people had played FarmVille over the years. And when we think about all of those fans and what their expectations are and how to bring them into a new experience, we\u2019ve doing a lot of testing. We\u2019re also running a bunch of FarmVille games right now, whether it\u2019s Country Escape or Tropic Escape, which has a very big fan base and they love the game.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And so it\u2019s a little bit more complicated to navigate some of the pre-set expectations, but what we\u2019ve done is really build out a terrific new experience and experience that is unlike LA. It has things that are familiar to people that have played FarmVille in the past, but it\u2019s got a lot of unique new elements to it, and a new look and feel that feels very modern and very cutting edge for what we believe mobile games really are these days.\n\nPuzzle Combat is more of a long play, and I like these types of strategies mixed in with shorter term plays. Zynga seems to have a healthy balance of this, which I really like.\n\nWhat I think Zynga does well is tailoring their games to the fan base. I think FV3 is going to be a fresh reboot of the beloved game by its fans with new elements to keep users engaged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Expansion into cross-platform gaming**\n\nAs mentioned, they acquired Echtra to boost their expansion into cross-platform gaming. Unrelated to the acquisition, one of the first cross-platform titles later this year will be Star Wars Hunters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Yeah. I think if you take a step back and look at the industry overall, some of the largest franchises in the world right now are cross-platform, and they\u2019re free to play in many cases with seasons passes and things like Fortnite, Pub G, Engine Impact, a lot of people have been talking about how the console developers getting into mobiles the thing. Well, I think that door swings both ways. I think mobile developers can actually step into the cross-platform mega franchise part of the market, because of a few reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding the team they acquired:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I think the last point I\u2019d make on cross-platform is that. We\u2019re just getting started in this. So the acquisition of Echtra is really a key one for us, because ultimately game quality is a function of game team talent and leadership. And when you look at these guys, they\u2019ve worked on RPGs for up their whole careers. They\u2019ve worked on Diablo, they helped to create Torchlight, which is a fantastic IP and the action RPG category. They\u2019ve actually published games cross-platform. It\u2019s a team less than 50 in San Francisco right near our shop.\n\nI think if the launch of Star Wars Hunters goes well in the second half of the year then I think it's possible we see a nice upward movement on the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Becoming a first party ads platform cutting out third party platforms like Google/Apple**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;...mid-point the last year, we started looking at the fact that we were one of the premier advertisers in gaming. All of our games are enabled for IAP and IAA. But between the time that they saw an ad and they ended up in our game, we had it was kind of opaque, right. We worked with other parties \u2013 other third particles or use other third-parties like, Iron Source or Unity app and Google, Facebook, and the third-parties were handling a lot of the information and a lot of the acquisition. And then we looked at our first party data asset, which is the data that we were generating around what a player was doing inside of our games.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And that was tremendously valuable, but we were missing that piece of it. And so when we looked at it, we said, wait a second. If we do a couple of things here, we can capture the 15% to 30% we\u2019re paying partners right now, just to manage the exchanges. We would get more information about what\u2019s hot, and what\u2019s not at the top of the funnel in terms of what\u2019s appealing? What\u2019s not appealing? What companies or products are doing better and why? We would be able to creatively optimize our products better. We ended in a post IDFA world that would all become first party data. The big issue with privacy is what is one party exchanging to another party about an individual, right? But if you enter one network and you have a good exchange of what your permissions are, you carry through that whole process in a high fidelity way from a data standpoint.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And so when we looked at it from multiple directions, we're like, wow, we can margin expand, we can pick up more efficiency in our UA dollars and in our advertising business. We could grow our advertising business faster and we could generate potentially a competitive advantage and information superiority, just knowing more about the players coming into our walled garden or into our platform than the next guy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We felt like this was something that we could go after. We went through a very diligent process of breaking down what these look like. And we found that some of these components we could build, some of these components we need to partner on and in addition to that in ad tech, there's a lot of - there's really a lot of vibrant companies and opportunities out there to potentially partner as you've seen from recent development.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So when we think about where we were as a company, we were a mobile pure play developer and publisher and we felt that that is a really valuable company, but we thought that we could become an even more valuable company by building out our platform by starting to grow our total addressable market by getting into consoles and PCs, and then leveraging this unique asset and hyper casual to really supercharge the platform as well as get us into a place where we're seeing more information coming into the top of the funnel and then converting them into players and ultimately payers.\"\n\nThis really sticks out to me. Zynga was 1 step ahead from the new pivot by Apple/Google on stronger ad tracking privacy. They're becoming the ads exchange where companies pay for displaying ads in games. This also gives them an advantage on learning what's working for others and apply that to their business model.\n\n[Here's a bite sized](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljywic/znga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) DD u/jojofroyo did.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice.

        "selftext": "This just burned me even though I thought I understood the pattern day trade rule and I can't trade on margin in my account for 95 days, so I wanted to share this with other ~~new investors~~ retards so they don't get burned by the pattern day trade rule like me.\n\n**This is not investment advice**, this is clarifying SEC-mandated regulations on what counts as a \"day trade\". Also, this is probably obvious to you seasoned artists (it is to me after Fidelity explained this all to me on the phone), but smooth-brained apes like myself might not understand this, or even panic at waking up to any margin call for $25000 (note - if you don't meet this you're not on the hook for it - you just get restrictions placed on your account for some time). Or maybe you read the many topics on day trading available on the internet and came to the same (wrong) conclusion as me.\n\nPattern day traders have different margin requirements than interday or non-pattern day traders. A pattern day trader is classified as someone who \"day trades 4 or more times in a 5 day period\", and a day trade is classified as \"the opening and closing of securities on the same day\". What sites don't explain better is that this is based on the *number of open positions, not the number of times you sell*.\n\nFor example, Fidelity explains [day trading on margin](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/day-trading-margin), and their following example of a day trade:\n\n- A purchase of 250 shares of ABC stock at 10 a.m., followed by a purchase of another 250 ABC shares at 11 a.m., followed by a sale of 500 ABC shares at 3 p.m.\n\nwhen read in the context of the page I linked to seems to imply that this would count as a single day trade. This is not the case. Over the course of yesterday I bought 92 shares of RKT over 6 orders, and I sold 70 of them near market close. This morning I woke up to a text saying I am subject to a day trade minimum equity call, and I now need to maintain equity of $25,000 or more to trade on margin.\n\nI'm not going to meet this (I have no interest in tying up $25,000 for pattern day trading), so in 5 days my account will be restricted to cash buying only for 90 days (though I can't trade on margin for the next 5 days anyways so it's basically 95 days), and I need to avoid day trading at all in that account or else the counter may reset. After 60 days of no day trades in the account, you revert to non-pattern day trade status, but for missing the minimum equity call you still can't trade on margin for 30 days after that.\n\nI have a cash account I usually day trade out of, but I impulse closed all of my other positions (besides GME) and YOLO'd into RKT. I profited nicely of of yesterday but this was the result of my greed. I at least have a decent amount of cash to invest after yesterday (and I did buy 5 more GME shares today, still holding 27 RKT positions), but I would not have bought 92 shares over several orders had I understood this would result in 5 day trades for the separate positions I had opened, not just one trade for the single sell order.\n\nLast thing I want to mention: don't trade on margin unless you know the risks. And if you are unsure of anything, you can always call your broker. And if you can't, stop trading on CashApp or RobinHood and get a real broker you absolute mong.\n\nAs for me... well I just bought 5 more shares of GME this morning with cash so maybe y'all can help me meet that minimum equity call :D (just kidding, this is not investment advice). Good luck, and godspeed, fellow artists.",

They helped direct me towards being confident in going with Fidelity. I've been making a few short hold trades, just to build up my financial strength and buying power. One thing I realized when reading a lot of the comments is individuals selling shares, and using those proceeds to immediately invest in another stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to point out, and while I myself am still learning so correct me if I am wrong please, once we sell a stock for proceeds, we have to wait about two business dates from the date of selling to allow those proceeds to become settled cash before we invest that money back into another stock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe with Fidelity, you are allowed 3 Good Faith Violations before your account is restricted for three months. I just wanted to point this out as a heads up for newer investors, like myself, who up until a week ago didn't even realize this was a rule!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe smart, do your research, have fun investing, and be safe!

        "selftext": " \n\n**Ok, so here\u2019s what happened with the Treasury Auctions this morning, these auctions sell off US debt including past debt and recent COVID spending:**\n\n13 Week Notes: $164B for sale, $53B sold\n\n26 Week Notes: $180B for sale, $50B sold\n\n(Source: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press\\_auctionresults.htm](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press_auctionresults.htm))\n\nSo basically a lot of unsold notes. Institutions who buy these expect set returns since they\u2019re mostly used for fixed income products (Bonds, companies like PIMCO, Vanguard, Fidelity and other countries are the buyers). When the returns aren\u2019t going to beat inflation which is projected to be high this year, they won\u2019t raise their hands to buy these.\n\nTreasury must then increase rates to make them more sell-able. This spikes the Treasury yield rates and makes borrowing money more expensive. When borrowing gets expensive companies that survive off loans (tech, growth) quickly become squeezed in valuation. Since last year\u2019s run up of tech, the squeeze is getting stronger and stronger for companies that are running off borrowed money.\n\nThe more \u201cidea\u201d driven a company, stock, or ETF is, the deeper it goes red. The more fundamental a company is, like what\u2019s in the Dow, they are not affected as much. They actually did great today with the stimulus being passed.\n\nThere are THREE MORE DAYS OF AUCTIONS this week. These are the bigger notes, 3, 10, 30 yr notes totaling about $150B. If these don\u2019t sell well (and they\u2019re not expected to, they are actually re-offerings from previous unsold auctions), prepare for more down days in the NASDAQ and any stock that doesn\u2019t have firm foundations financially as yields go UP (where to see Treasury yield: [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx))\n\nGood luck and evaluate what you own, why, and if the time is right.",

        "selftext": "Want to get off RH? Afraid of missing the squeeze?\n\nIf you're still on that piece of trash platform you're essentially choosing to stay in an abusive relationship. RH showed in January that they either can't or won't support you during large market events. The reasons why don't even matter, they can't. \n\nHarken back to the Cuban AMA. Remember that? One of his foremost pieces of advice was to get a real broker with a trillion dollar balance sheet. Fidelity or Vanguard, pick one. Doesn't matter which they're both boomer hellscapes to interact with but they at least have your back.\n\nNow do a partial account transfer. This is \\*faster\\* than a full account transfer and just transfers specific shares of your choosing. I did this and transferred my volatile shares to Fidelity and they were only in limbo for a day or two. Then I did my full account transfer separately, and that took about two weeks of which 4 days or so the shares were truly locked up.\n\nIf this seems too hard then maybe you should know that there is a non-zero chance RH may disable *selling* during the squeeze. Did you see that recent offering to give you cash for deposits? They're desperate for money and on their last legs. If anyone asks them for a big chunk of collateral they are instantly GOING TO FOLD AGAIN. It might sound harsh but if this happens and your shit is locked up and you can't sell, that's your own damn fault. It's been a month and a half that people have been screaming to get a real broker.\n\nDon't leave your tickets to the moon inside some ramshackle shed with a rusted lock.

I think this is a good talking point. \"  \n\n\n  \nBuying the dip to average down when affordable is definitely the way, but there are circumstances where some movement in the opposite direction in regards to average price is not overly detrimental\n\nSomeone was talking about having learned the way of averaging down today in the discussion thread. I'm actually doing the opposite unfortunately with my GME. I bought in on the back side of the 2nd \"crash\" at a few times for an average **$75.55 a share** for 9 shares.  \n\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nI've been buying fractionally when sensible and I'm sitting on 9.39 Shares now. in the process though my average has gone to $**85.8546 a share** ( a $6.01 change over 0.4 shares of fractional pickups. (These pickups have been the daily dips)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAveraging down when you are strongly out of the money is in my opinion one of the most important aspects in the WSB \"strategy\" of buying dips , holding long, and locking in the lowest average possible.\n\nGME and this short situation makes this one of those situations w*here every share and every bit of a fractional share are going to skyrocket,* so in this case quantity at a reasonable risk and entry point **is my priority.**  \n\n\nI'm adding a snip from my fidelity - there's AMC and AAL below that &amp; 1 share of GME on Robinhood back when it was 80 bucks. ( i know i know) Robinhood is bad, no doubt, BUT The wife is handling robin hood. Its  smaller stakes but she is doing a good job &amp; to me rationalizes still using the platform until i can get her to fidelity  \n\n\nThat's why the fidelity account became our trading platform for main investments, Robinhood for light (math based - non-centralized) ( to avoid the C word) investment and more long term holdings.  Also we have 500ish working in stash just as a long term holding.\n\nThank you to everyone in the WSB community for your information, analysis and conversation.  \n\n\nAs a matter of disclosure {ill honestly sell 2 shares when the second fractal tops out around 1200 to recoup my investment (actually covers across all my trading platforms)} &amp; THE REST IS FUEL FOR THE ROCKET TO MARS. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am diamond hand to the moon, but I want the wife to have a confident feeling out of investing with proper Due Diligence, and seeing real returns. I hope to have fractional bought 2.0 more full shares in the mean time so I don't have to touch my main shares.  \n\n\nTLDR: So to summarize while it is usually optimal to try to get your average cost per share down, sometimes a rise in that number is inevitable if you got in early enough. Don't be afraid of a reasonable change in your price per share if quantity is your main asperation  \n\n\nAvg per share was 75.55 for 9 ( buying fractionally it has increased to 81.56 for the gain of .39 shares) \n\n[omg - average cost discussion - Fidelity as proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/TTKV4sZ) \\-imgur link with a bit more exposition.   \n\n\nThank you all  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Same as the top image- straight from my Fidelity Account](https://preview.redd.it/eydglmvuvbn61.jpg?width=2123&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0636575620e12874d3c4ed9fffa6063f0e3f846e)",

(that's my own understanding.) for  example,\n\n&gt;Hydrogen  opportunities were investigated during the quarter and continue with a  growing interest in the space from industry and government. The  synergies between wave energy and hydrogen production strengthen  productionstrengthen the case and Carnegie has been particularly focused  on opportunities that encompass existing target markets such as  islands,  remote areas, and marine energy consumers including fish  farming. In parallel, enabling technologies are being developed by a  variety of companies that are complementary to Carnegie\u2019s activities.   For example, electrolyzers,  the  devices  that  produce  hydrogen  from   water and  electricity,  are being developed can now use seawater as  their hydrogen source rather than freshwater  \nHydrogen   is most likely to play a  role as long/medium-term storage or as a   fuel source for vessels and generators. Carnegie\u2019s role in the Blue  Economy CRCis providing good insight into the topic of hydrogen in the  marine space and opportunities will continue to be identified.\n\nthis  is basically a long-term play and they will specify it in there as  well. Imo I see the demand for renewable energy. I feel like there will  be heavy reform on how Companies and consumers use energy in the  following 50 years. they specify that in the report.\n\n&gt;Carnegie  continues to seegrowing vision and support for offshore renewables  around the world as demonstrated by actions such as the European  Commission publishing a dedicated EU strategy on offshore renewable  energyin November 2020(An EU Strategy to harness thepotential  of   offshore  renewable  energy  for  a  climate  neutral  future). The EU\u2019s  strategysupports an objective of achievingat least1 GW of ocean energy  by 2030 and 60 GW of oceanenergy  by  2050.  It  alsoproposes  a   strategyto  make  offshore  renewable  energy  a  corecomponent of  Europe\u2019s energy system by 2050.In  the  US,the  new  President  has   significantly  elevated  the  issue  of  climate  change  withrenewed   commitment  to  the  Paris  Agreement.  Carnegie  sees  this  as  highly   positive  andexpects support measures for marine renewables to  increaseas a result\n\nThey  basically go on about all the collab theyre making with the companies  listed above and the fundings they're getting and how the tech works.

With all the millions of EVs coming online  in the next several years the world will need to quickly generate more  energy and marine energy will have to be a big part of that plan.\n\nCarnegie  has hundreds of patents the reason HPE, Microsoft, and Enel Energy are  partnering with them is for the intellectual property.

        "selftext": "As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In the end the two I landed on were:**\n\n[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms\n\n[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: [I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMethodologies:\n\n* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet\n* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before\n* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker \"high\" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data\n* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are\n   * What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)\n   * Which social media is the most profitable?\n   * What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)\n   * How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**\n\n1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing\n2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money\n3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category\n4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money\n5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other interesting finds:**\n\nStocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasible\n\nStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%  \n\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nObviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:\n\n1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on them  \nThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice\n2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far\n3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my \"responsible\" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better.",

I know they tried some fuckery with restricting buying in January. I actually contacted them about this and they basically said \"soz our intermediary makes decisions we just push buttons\" which is fair enough.\n\nBut in the reverse situation, do they have any real reasons to prevent me from choosing when to close my positions? I read on a post earlier that eToro have in their terms and conditions a short sentence about being able to close your open transactions at a price that they deem proportionate (section 29.3).  Surely T212 will be similar in their behavior during this event?\n\nMy theory is that they hopefully will not restrict the selling due to the clear case for lawsuits + it doesn't financially hinder them in any way. But at the same time if they are at the mercy of their intermediary who are themselves linked to those that are about to be liquidated then perhaps that will start a vicious chain down to me.\n\nTL;DR Just need a more experienced ape to assess the situation clearly - should I worry or nah?",

But I am not talking about small differences here.\n\nAlso, I did check my orders and what I put in my stock tracking app matches my \"Completed Orders\" with Fidelity.\n\nExample:\n\nI bought a stock for, let's say $23.87 per share.  Fidelity showed a notification with the number of shares I purchased, plus the exact price per share, which matches ($23.87).\n\nI then put the stock into my stock tracking app with the number of shares and price per share.\n\nBut let's say a week later I check on the stock.\n\nMy tracking app shows the correct info and shows that the stock has gone up to $24.75 and I'm at a profit.\n\nHowever, when I go into the Fidelity app and look at that stock, while it also shows the stock's current price as $24.75, it shows my \"Cost Basis Per Share\" as $28.19 and shows my \"Total Gain/Loss\" to be a loss of hundreds of dollars!\n\nI know that the original purchase price that I get the stock for is a little higher than Fidelity gets it for, so they can make money.  That's fine.  But.....\n\n* This is a big difference!\n* What does \"Cost Basis Per Share\" even mean?\n* I thought that whatever price they gave me in the \"Order Completed\" notification should accurately reflect what I paid for the stock, no?\n\nCan anyone help me understand this please?  I'm not brand new to stocks.  I'm just new to this broker and I've never had this happen before, nor seen this many columns in the Portfolio (Positions) screen. :-)\n\nThank You!",

        "selftext": "I have been using Robinhood. Despite the people who are mad about the Gamestop issue, it has worked well for me.

I am sure this comparison is not as simple as I think it is.\n\nI am also considering using my brokerage account for my day to day banking.

When I buy a vertical spread, the two options are bundled as one and operate as a net debit or net credit trade, which is great and fast and super slick. I can't seem to find a way to enter a stop loss order on *both* positions simultaneously, though. I want to be able to trade the entire spread as a bundled entity so to speak, not as individual options. If I close one leg of the spread, I want the other to be automatically bundled with, because buying one leg back costs a huge amount of money, and then I have to sell the other one at the same time, which would seem to require a conditional order. I'm hoping it's not this complicated. Is there any way to trade a vertical spread as *one* bundled position once it's in your portfolio? Let me know if what I'm asking makes sense!",

        "selftext": "You've probably heard the news by now that 6 Dr Seuss books will no longer be published for imagery that has been deemed racist. Regardless of your political beliefs, we're all here to make MONEY. Basic supply and demand indicates that discontinued books will skyrocket in value if demand increases. Sure enough, within two days, these banned Dr Seuss books are now worth their weight in [fucking gold](https://www.cbr.com/dr-seuss-banned-books-sell-high-pries-seconday-market/).\n\nHere's a breakdown by numbers. I'm using data from Barnes and Noble online to establish the normal hardcover price, and then the lowest price on Amazon to establish approximate selling price after it was announced that they will no longer be published:\n\n* The Cat's Quizzer\n   * $9.99 ---&gt; $499.99 **(4,905% increase)**\n* If I Ran the Zoo\n   * $17.99 ---&gt; $594.00 **(3,202% increase)**\n* On Beyond Zebra\n   * $16.99 ---&gt; $425.25 **(2,403% increase)**\n* Scrambled Eggs Super\n   * $14.75 ---&gt; $325.00 **(2,103% increase)**\n* McElligot's Pool\n   * $19.99 ---&gt; $325.00 **(1,526% increase)**\n* And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street\n   * $16.99 ---&gt; $224.25 **(1,220% increase)**\n\nEvery single one of these is a literal ten-bagger. What's even more crazy is that this [Insider article](https://www.insider.com/classic-childrens-books-that-havent-aged-well-2019-5#if-i-ran-the-zoo-by-theodor-seuss-geisel-aka-dr-seuss-has-been-criticized-for-containing-numerous-offensive-images-1) sort of called it almost two years ago\u2014the first book on their list is If I Ran the Zoo. In addition to the above mentioned Insider article, I looked through several lists of books that are being challenged for racial content. My analysis leads me to believe that *The Indian in the Cupboard* by Lynne Reid Banks, currently being published by Harper Collins, is a prime candidate for a discontinued book squeeze. Here's why:\n\n1. **Low Search Volume**. Here's a Google trends graph of how often the recalled Dr Seuss books were searched for on Amazon. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d178buhtl2l61.png?width=2322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ad443bc373d439abe34e87d8fbd8c8d04ffd32a\n\nNotice how there's nobody trying to buy these books? This makes sense. No publisher in their right mind would discontinue a popular children's book. This is why books like *The Cat in the Hat* or *Peter Pan*, which have also been criticized, will never go out of print. It would be a financial nightmare.\n\nIn contrast, look at how Indian in the Cupboard stacks up against some other contenders:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xe9dbpun2l61.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e3995810de807ae599684cd690ba7efc2149b7\n\nIf you follow the red trendline, you will see that searches for \"Indian in the Cupboard Amazon\" are effectively 0 with some slight upticks every now and then. This contrasts with Amazon searches for titles like Little House on the Prairie, which sees consistent search frequency. Discontinuing further printings of The Indian in the Cupboard will probably have little impact on HarperCollins' margins.\n\n2. **Broad readership base, particularly among middle-aged readers.** In addition to being discontinued, a book will need to have excess demand before the price will surge. This will happen only if the book has a broad readership base. In Dr Seuss's case, so many adults have probably read at least one of the 6 discontinued books growing up (hell I loved Mulberry Street when I was little), which is why they're actually buying up these books now that they've become limited edition items. It probably helps that Dr Seuss wrote his books to help children read and literally every elementary school still uses his writing to teach literacy skills.\n\nSimilarly, *The Indian in the Cupboard* was actually well-received in the 80s and was incorporated into school curriculums nationwide. You can still find entire teaching guides built around *The Indian in the Cupboard*, and I distinctly remember reading this book and filling out worksheets back in third grade 2009. Yeah, this book isn't as popular as it once was, but I'm willing to bet that in the 40 years that it's been out, it's been able to build a solid fanbase of readers who will buy a copy out of nostalgia once this book gets banned. This also gives *The Indian in the Cupboard* an advantage over books like *Pippi Longstocking,* which\u2014despite being a children's book with low search volume\u2014is beloved in Sweden but has a much smaller audience in America.\n\n3. **History of contentious debate.** The controversy over Dr Seuss's books didn't just happen overnight (although it certainly felt that way). His books have been banned in libraries for years and there are [arguments](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/reckoning-dr-seuss-racist-imagery-has-been-years-making-n1259330) going all the way back to the 90s about whether his books are racist. This is the same situation that *The Indian in the Cupboard* finds itself in. It's been removed from numerous public libraries and the American Library Association leadership advised educators to avoid the book as far back as 1991. This is important because the decision to remove books is typically time-sensitive. Given almost 30 years to consider whether or not to discontinue publishing, Harper Collins likely has enough financial data and a good picture of consumer preferences, especially under the current political climate, to decide that they will stop further publications of *The Indian in The Cupboard*. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind that there is significantly less liquidity with trading books than stocks. However, books are still less volatile and, like art pieces, tend to appreciate in value over time. I think that *The Indian in the Cupboard* is a long-term hold which has the potential to increase ten fold when it inevitably gets pulled from circulation.",

        "selftext": "Okay so here are my thoughts. Behind Nestle, PepsiCo is the biggest company in it's sector by revenue. It also follows Coke stock fairly closely. But what made the difference this last year was how these two comparable soda giants fared during covid 19.\n\nKO or Coke performed extremely poorly and made less money yoy. It's payout ratio for its dividend was touching 94%. Meaning they only had 6% left over after paying out their shareholders. That's not a lot of money to do much of anything with. ESPECIALLY in an industry that needs to move towards new products with the decline in popularity of Soda.\n\nTo compare with PepsiCo, which even during the pandemic found a way to make more revenue in 2020 than in 2019.\n\nTo give you specific numbers, in 2018 was an increase in total revenue by 1.79% compared to 2017. In 2019 it increased 3.87% compared to 2018, and in 2020 increased a 4.78% which might I remind you that this increase happened during the pandemic. Now why did PepsiCo do well against their main rival coke?\n\nTo answer this in simple terms their portfolio was more diversified than coke's and they focused on releasing new and more popular products as well as packaged food which saw a huge boost in sales from \"Toilet Paper Bandits\" or panic shoppers stocking up on bags of fritos, lays, cheetos, and on the healthier side of things Quaker Oats and other products. Until recently most people thought coke stock was king between the two companies but I believe 2020 may have put pepsi on the podium as our clear winner of the Cola Wars.\n\nPepsi has a dividend yield of 3.12% and a payout ratio of 79.88%\n\nCoke has a dividend yield of 3.35% and a payout ratio of 93.85%\n\nWith the payout ratios so high I am a little concerned for dividend increases for both but I would be shocked if coke raised it any more than they had to to keep their dividend status.\n\nShare price:\n\nI see PepsiCo valued at $154.36 a share\nTrevis Evaluation puts then at $150.16 which I believe is low but close to a 20 dollar per share increase or more either way.\n\nThis is an upside of 18.46% not including dividends.\n\nAnd I calculated Coke to be valued at $52.72 a share.\nTrevis Evaluation puts it at $55.48 which is more than I calculated.\n\nTaking the higher of the two numbers this leave a share price upside of around 11.00%\n\nThere are many other reasons I believe Pepsi is going to be the better long term pick like how they released the new cocktail mixers neon Zebra (which I would love to try) to take some of the cocktail mixer marketshare. Which the mixer market tops 858 MM$ and an industry that grew 35% just last year. Cocktail culture is coming to North America and in the United States and Canada we are heavily accepting these delicious mixers that are premade and easy to make.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these two companies or their sectors in general? Do you think PepsiCo is undervalued? Or do you think Coke is still a better buy? Let me know in the comments.\n\nDisclaimer: I am Long PepsiCo and hold positions in the stock mentioned above.",
