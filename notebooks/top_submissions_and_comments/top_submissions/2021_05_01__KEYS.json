Investors saw a bleak reminder of how risky some government bonds can be during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998. During this crisis, several Asian nations were forced to devalue their currency which sent reverberations around the globe. The crisis even caused Russia to default on its debt.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp)\n\nAbout all this... Michael Burry has been warning us about a possible hyperinflation, all this will be **explained LATER ON!!**\n\nI'm going to break down each one of Kenny strategies as we go in the post.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TRUST BONDS: The basket of bonds INFITINE MONEY GLITCH!!!**\n\nFirst of all let me stress how important this is!\n\n**THIS IS KENNY MAIN SOURCE OF CASH (LIQUIDITY)**, with this he's able to do all kinds of fuckery from shorting, to all the washing methods above (Ill explain more with sources as we move forward).\n\nThey love shorting because they love producing naked shares to fill up the juicy [**TRUST BONDS**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateraltrustbond.asp#:~:text=A%20collateral%20trust%20bond%20is,pay%20the%20bondholder%2C%20if%20necessary) and get more and more cash for liquidity and fukery!!\n\nSo what's inside those **TRUST BONDS?**\n\n\"A collateral trust bond is a bond that is secured by a financial asset such as stock or other bonds\"\n\nWAIT WHAT???\n\nSo you telling me that Kenny is not only able to put his NAKED SHARES inside this basket called **TRUST BONDS** and pack it to sell, but that he can **PUT TRUST BONDS INSIDE OTHER TRUST BONDS?**\n\nThis is the pyramid and biggest **PONZI SCHEME!!!!**\n\nHear me out:\n\nThey have been **shorting many businesses** and also **buying some long positions in many other** businesses (I read somewhere and I cant find the source that Citadel controls 26% (according to the senate in the hearing) of the market). Thank you for the comment u/citadelsecuritiesLLC\n\nSo this means that they can **grab a basket** (TRUST BOND) and **filling it up with half \"good solid long positions\"**(lets say aple, tesla, amazon) and **half GME naked made up shares!!, close the basket and sell it!. Thats a 50% Good old TRUST BOND from citadel.**\n\n**HOLY ACTUAL FU%\\^CK!! Are you serious??**\n\nGets worse!!\n\nSo you telling me that you can **fill bonds with other bonds?** That's tranching and creating the pyramid of shit underneath!\n\n**THIS IS THE BIG SHORT ALL OVER AGAIN!!**\n\nThe first baskets full with the Good nice long positions and real shorts go first! like the AAA in the movie?\n\nThe **last baskets are going be filled with not only GME naked shorts**, but with a **MIX OF ALL THE OTHER COMPANIES THEY ARE SHORTING INCLUDING TESLA, AMAZON** and you name **to give them a better rating and price, BUT THEY ARE COMPLETELY FULL OF NOTHING INSIDE!!** those ones are the equivalent of the BBB LIKE IN THE BIG SHORT!!!\n\nCome on! is this **HAPPENING AGAIN**, are you serious?????\n\n**WHEN IS THIS PEOPLE GOING TO LEARN???**\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now... The biggest banks are holdings! (READ BELLOW ABOUT IT)**\n\n**Kenny and kids (Melvin, Susquehanna and other baby hedge funds) have been shorting over and over to own companies debt to hold leverage against the banks for daddy Kenny as well!**\n\nSo... **While the company is not yet bankrupt \u2026.** [Shitadel MM makes trust bonds](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-12-08-0612080128-story.html)**, pack them with all the fake GME naked shares inside (can be mixed with other company shorts or full GME) and** [sell them as if they were full of valuable real GME](https://www.wiredupreport.com/2021/03/16/viral/citadel-issued-600m-worth-of-bbb-rated-bonds/) **(the system don\u2019t recognize fakes from reals, right?)** Getting tons of money!\n\n**That's a big part of how he gets his Liquidity!!**\n\nHis process is extremely complex, he uses algorithms to move the money constantly and very fast, trenching those bonds inside others and reposition them to hide all the rubbish undetected, also buying T-bonds, mortgages, short more companies and etc.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nAlso, like the [SEC document](https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/) states, Kenny and other banks are funding other business in many other countries giving them money and taking advantage (we know how).\n\nWhen those business bankrupt too! Archegos style!!, they go and buy the real state overseas dirt cheap!) They love making naked shares because that\u2019s how they get liquidity out of those useless juicy trust bonds.\n\nExplained better in the KENNY SCAMMING AROUND THE WORLD in PART 2\n\n**So the money come from none existent trash and then make a shit ton more moving it?** Holy Balls!\n\n**The ones who buy those Shitadel trust bonds are the bagholders!! They are buying bonds that are full of shit!!**\n\nHe is successfully draining the money from the company, from the retail shareholder and for all the people that bought those trust bonds!! While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!! THIS NEEDS TRACTION SO EVERY APE SEES IT!**\n\n**SHARE IT WITH OTHER APES IN OTHER POSTS AND COMMENTS!! ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE LOUD!**\n\nI RUN OUT OF CHARACTERS!!!

They are buying bonds that are full of shit!!**\n\nHe is successfully draining the money from the company, from the retail shareholder and for all the people that bought those trust bonds!! While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!! THIS NEEDS TRACTION SO EVERY APE SEES IT!**\n\n**SHARE IT WITH OTHER APES IN OTHER POSTS AND COMMENTS!! ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE LOUD!**\n\nI RUN OUT OF CHARACTERS!!!

They love making naked shares because that\u2019s how they get liquidity out of those useless juicy trust bonds.\n\nExplained better in the KENNY SCAMMING AROUND THE WORLD in PART 2\n\n**So the money come from none existent trash and then make a shit ton more moving it?** Holy Balls!\n\n**The ones who buy those Shitadel trust bonds are the bagholders!! They are buying bonds that are full of shit!!**\n\nHe is successfully draining the money from the company, from the retail shareholder and for all the people that bought those trust bonds!! While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!! THIS NEEDS TRACTION SO EVERY APE SEES IT!**\n\n**SHARE IT WITH OTHER APES IN OTHER POSTS AND COMMENTS!! ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE LOUD!**\n\nI RUN OUT OF CHARACTERS!!!

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI have been a long time and poster on this subreddit through some other account names, but wanted to make a more official account in order to share my ideas. \n\nI wanted to share with you guys a very basic SPAC trading strategy that I have been working on over the past few months. After developing it a bit further, I will be coming out with another blog post to cover the improvements that I have made to my trading model. \n\n[https://gainsandgrowth.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/spacs-a-trading-strategy/](https://gainsandgrowth.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/spacs-a-trading-strategy/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasics of the strategy:\n\n **1. SPACS offer a unique investment opportunity due to the \u201cprice floor\u201d** \n\n **2. SPACs tend to stay at or around the floor price until news surrounding the potential acquisition of a target is disseminated to the public** \n\n **3. SPACs will inevitably correct to the terms of the merger once they are announced** \n\nSo there are three keys points in this trading strategy\n\n1. **Identifying when investors \u201cnotice\u201d this stock.** If you can get in when investors notice the stock, you can ride the wave with them while avoiding the period of stagnation prior to major price movements.\n2. **Taking your gains and running.** I cannot stress this component of the strategy enough. We are not investing for the long term on this strategy, we don\u2019t even know anything about the company yet! We take our gains when we have them, and we revaluate if there is another point that is suitable for entry later down the road.\n3. **Reducing loses on \u201cFalse Positives\u201d.** If we enter into a position, we want to have clear end points for when we leave that position. Sometimes there will be false positives where we enter in the position, and no price action occurs, or the price of the SPAC falls. We want to get out quickly in these scenarios, since we are focusing on being ready to enter when the stock shoots up.\n\n**VOLUME**\n\nAs mentioned previously, the indicator is abnormal volume. This frees up the investor from monitoring news media and announcements, and focusing solely on the resulting interest in the company. What I have identified as a strong indicator of immediate upward price movements is three days of sustained volume above 200% of the monthly average volume.\n\nThis eliminates random trading days where the trading volume is high for unknown reasons. Maybe a fund is entering the SPAC and has bought a significant number of shares, who knows! We don\u2019t like just one day increases in volume because that can be anomaly. Three days of sustained large volume has appeared by the right indicator, but can of course be refined further. This is what I call the \u201cBuy Counter\u201d.\n\n**TAKING GAINS**\n\nThe second key part of this strategy is taking your gains. I have set an upward limit on price movement for 10%. After 10%, my algorithm will take its gains and exit the position, and will continue to monitor the SPAC and look for indicators to re-enter. The idea behind this being that a 10% return is an amazing return for any investor, especially over a short time frame. If we can string together many of these 10% returns, then I would be more than happy with the performance of my portfolio. This number is obviously arbitrary, and would benefit from more statistical analysis, but for the purposes of my initial tests I deemed it a fine starting point.\n\n**LIMITING FALSE POSITIVES**\n\nThe third key part of this strategy is reducing the times that you enter into a stock when the stock does not behave as expected. I also realized that towards middle/end of a SPACs lifecycle, volume indicators may also be true for major price corrections (refer to the CCIV graph and look at the volume towards the end of February). Therefore I also included a condition that the price increases over that 3 day period to avoid buying in on a fire sale.\n\n**Results:**\n\nI tested this strategy against 73 different SPACs, with $1000 to trade on these names from August 1st 2020 to April 18th 2021, and achieved a 20.5% return across the entire universe in my self built testing environment.\n\nParticularly impressive results were:\n\n1. TPGY: 203%\n2. ACTC 103%\n3. CCIV: 93%\n4. NGA 53%\n5. GHVI: 50%",

        "selftext": "For most people CumRocket seems like a funny memecoin, however for those who see it\u2019s potential it could revolutionise the porn industry. Here are some complied reasons as to why CumRocket is a solid investment right now. Obligatory this is not financial advice.  \n\nThe token unlike most meme coins actually has an real world use and an expanding economy. Right now it\u2019s used to buy nudes (that the models themselves are selling) and tip cam girls on NFT sites. But they are going to actually expand and either take on or combine with the porn industry.  \n\nHere are a few examples of how that might work:  \n\nScenario 1: They combine with the Porn industry and become the standard blockchain of choice for premium porn sites and other NSFW sites like OnlyFans. By having an alternative anonymous way to purchase subscriptions and porn, this allows many more people to engage monetarily with the porn industry. Right now millions of horney men and women are unable to access the content they want due to shared bank accounts and snooping partners. CumRocket offers the solution through anonymous payments.  \n\nScenario 2: they take on the porn industry by creating their own sites. They have already blackboarded this and are willing to offer 5% more than any other platform to creators while also offering complete anonymity for both the creator and buyer. Models would be paid and tipped in $CUMMIES.  \n\nThere is also a NFT marketplace where creators can sell their content. Buyers would have said content stored in their wallet, removing the need to store the content manually on a pc or hard drive. In other words the only way someone could access their porn is if they had their wallet keys.  \n\nFor many people around the world who are either embarrassed for creating porn or persecuted for it, CumRocket is the answer. In Australia where it\u2019s legal to be a sex worker they still struggle with mortgages due to the nature of the job. CumRockets allows them to show profits as an investment instead of sex.  \n\nNo matter which way $CUMMIES goes it cannot lose, they have already a growing list of content creators signing up and it\u2019s only a matter of time until one of the scenarios comes into fruition.  \n\nAudits have been done and passed, exchanges are interested, the token is deflationary with a small starting supply. It might have started as a meme but it won\u2019t end in one.",

But Robinhood's restricted list was way bigger and included stocks such as AMD, AAL, BYND, GM, IPOE, MRNA, and SBUX. I had got into stocks in January 2021 as a new years resolution. Which was a couple weeks before the GME stuff and reddit trading was even all over the news. At the time I honestly thought the buying restriction was something a part of the stock market. As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. \n\nNow that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that. They limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside. I really hope that doesn't happen again.",

When I say all in, I mean I have less than $100 left in my bank account... all in. I don\u2019t have a lot of money, but I truly believed RKT had to go up. I had $17,000 (my entire savings + checking) in calls and I\u2019m sure tomorrow they will be practically worthless. I have a baby coming in 3 weeks and now I have to tell my wife I lost all our money. After I had done fairly well the past few months on stocks, she was confident in me and allowed me to do this. I still believe RKT is a great company and their results are incredible. I still believe it\u2019s hugely undervalued. But none of that matters now. I\u2019ve learned a very hard lesson and will never buy calls again, and will probably leave the market alone for quite a while completely while I try to get back on my feet. I was so confident in RKT I didn\u2019t see it as a gamble, but it was all along. And I lost it all. I realize for most of you on here $17,000 isn\u2019t a lot. But for me it was.

        "selftext": "The Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.\n\nThe lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.\n\nCurrent sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.\n\nAlso, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!\n\nThe Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.\n\nELI5: Basically all the stocks that have crashed because the companies don't generate free cash flow will go up again.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** = MindMed will solve and own the hundred-billion dollar market to treat depression, alcoholism, opioid addiction, anxiety, PTSD \n\nMindMed will be releasing their **Phase 2** results using **LSD to treat anxiety** very soon which was completed May 1, 2021! [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03153579](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03153579)\n\nSold off from NASDAQ, now institutions are going to load the boat. Also short interest is pretty high, so a big bounce is coming. \n\n\\----------\n\n**Background on the Sector**\n\nThere are three topics everyone who wants to understand the Psychedelic Sector needs to know up front:\n\n**1) Intent:** This sector is fundamentally different from the Cannabis Sector in a large way. The target market is primarily medicinal uses rather than recreational uses. Cannabis has a large recreational movement, where psychedelics have a small one. While this may deter some folks, I find it reassuring: to play in this space a company must be serious and committed.\n\n**2) Diversity:** There are a number of drugs in the psychedelic space - psilocybin (mushrooms), LSD (acid), MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine (anesthetic), to name a few. Each is in some stage of clinical trials, and each company is attempting to use different ones to treat different mental and behavioral health conditions. These conditions are diverse as well, though the largest target markets include ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and drug and alcohol addiction.\n\n**3) Delivery:** Psychedelic research today is not seeking to put high volumes of over-the-counter mushrooms or LSD pills in your local CVS. Psychedelics are being researched in controlled microdoses, and the intended delivery is by trained therapists through guided psychotherapy sessions. Psychedelics on their own may give your mind a period of disconnection and subdued feelings of fear, but with proper guidance from a trained therapist this period also becomes an opportunity for \"rewiring\" old mental blocks that lead to mental illness. Some people begin to break through chronic mental health barriers in just a few appointments. CNN recently covered the sector in an hour long special under Lisa Ling's \"This is Life\" series called \"Psychedelic Healing\" (Season 7, Episode 6). This demonstrates the delivery method well, as well as several early success stories.\n\n**MindMed DD --&gt; Kevin O'Leary, Bruce Linton and the Najarian Brothers are in this**\n\nThough my summary is below, don\u2019t just take my word for it! MindMed has an incredibly well organized [website](https://mindmed.co/) where you can see much of this for yourself.\n\n*As an investor in a sector with a diversity of molecules and a diversity of applications*, you want a company that has a diverse approach. **That\u2019s MindMed** \\- which is in Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials with each 18-MC, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and psilocybin tackling a variety of conditions, including anxiety, opioid withdrawal, ADHD, and cluster headaches, to name a few. This diversity give MindMed a high chance of having not just one, but several breakthrough molecules. Kevin O\u2019Leary (yes, Shark Tank\u2019s Mr. Wonderful) is perhaps the most well-known investor in MindMed.\n\n*As an investor in a sector that requires integration with therapists*, including new tools and training, you want a company that is developing more than just the necessary drugs. **MindMed is the whole package.** MindMed has paired with NYU to develop therapist training strategies and has announced its launch of Albert, a digital medicine division meant to tie it all together. MindMed's recent announcements have indicated they are actively hiring to give this division more depth and to potentially undertake an acquisition in the digital platform space. MindMed is already thinking about **how** we make this work. In the future, a therapist will have use this digital tool to keep a list of psychedelic options catered to a host of mental conditions, and each will be tied to delivery strategies and training. MindMed's wholistic view from clinical trials through implementation is what sets them apart from others in the sector.\n\n*As an investor in a sector that is \"breakthrough\" in nature*, you want a company that has the right leadership. In January, Robert Barrow entered the MindMed team as the Chief Development Officer. Robert brings extensive knowledge of psilocybin research, but more importantly he was part of securing the Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA for his prior psilocybin program (Phase 2 Clinical Trials) at the Usona Institute. MindMed hopes to secure similar breakthrough designations for their trials and fast-track them. **Bruce Linton**, former Canopy Growth (CGC) Chairman and CEO, sits on MindMed's Board of Directors. Dr. Halperin Wernli and Carol Nast, President and COO respectively, each help round out the management team with over 50 combined years of leadership in drug and product development in emerging markets and heavily regulated environments.\n\nFinally, I know every investor wants to know how much the stock price will move over time, so here are a few catalysts to think on:\n\n**Next catalysts:** This is more obvious, but of course any trial milestones are catalysts! I\u2019m particularly excited about August/September this year when we expect Phase 2b trial results to begin rolling in, though Phase 1 announcements will continue to occur as the portfolio grows as well. With any luck, breakthrough designations will accelerate trials and portfolio growth further.",

I'm hearing many people claim it will be more than double this come the next earnings report on May 17th.\n\nFor some quick background - CLOV, or Clover Health Investments, is a healthcare technology company that has been on the rise for quite some time now. They've been increasing their member count substantially and each member has pulled in more profit for the company as time moves forward.\n\nRight now I think that the company is OVERWHELMINGLY UNDERVALUED.\n\nThis is not just a 'potential meme' stock, but it is definitely a long-term growth stock with investors in mind.\n\nRight now the company is approaching $10 per share with a prior peak at ~$17.07 back in December, and a low of around ~$7.29 in March (for reference).\n\nThe stock appears to hang around the $10 mark generally, but search traffic has been increasing (checked using google trends) and I'm hearing a lot of talk with the next earnings report. Combine this with a higher volatility, this leads me to believe CLOV might be my lucky stock of choice that will bring me to paradise \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\n\nI'm trying to start a mini-discussion here of the potential of CLOV as both a long-term and short-term investment.

Okay good stuff.\n\nThen some shit short selling report from Hidenburg research came out accusing them of some bad practices and a DOJ investigation.  That shit was overhyped and short sellers jumped on that and started shorting\u2026. They shorted it down to about 7 bucks, that was a hella bargain price to get in it. Lots of companies get summoned to provide information by the DOJ, its really not a big deal, but was overhyped.\n\nNow this company is legit.  Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurer that combines technology and preventive care to lower costs and increase the quality of life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- They have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive.\n\n\\- Biden and democrats are looking to lower the medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.\n\n\\- Short interest is above 35% \u2026 so yes possible squeeze potential too.\n\n\\- Board of directors has got Chelsea Clinton on it, and she is obviously tight with the democratic party. \n\n\\- They moved earnings up\u2026. Which is usually a good sign.\n\n\\- There are 360k calls expiring on May 21, and earnings are a couple days before on May 17th. (only 56k puts, so the call to put ratio is pretty damn high)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has got some real potential to double by earnings, maybe even more.\n\n I got in a bit late and bought high, dont be me and get in early on monday!\n\nPosition: 4531 shares at $10.72 - and (16) May 21st, $11 call options.

        "selftext": "I've been an E\\*TRADE user for close to a decade now, but over the last few months, I've had a few **significant** issues within my account that simply shouldn't be happening. The type of mistakes that would likely throw the average person into a full-blown panic attack, or worse...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first \"issue\" was during the $GME uprising. I woke up like the rest of you, except with a **$234,357.55 cash call** on my account. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cash Call](https://preview.redd.it/mrndbfvwxax61.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c62fa1ae8a0f65d77c9f75e490d231fd166e4f25)\n\nYou may be thinking, \"you stupid fucking idiot stop playing with margin and that wont happen\", but my account was never even approved for margin lol. I owned **&lt;10 shares** of $GME at the time, and was selling them 1 by 1 as the price travelled through the $300's (sorry). So when I saw that I somehow had unwillingly entered a **short position of 736 SHARES OF $GME AT $22.86**, which my account literally did not have the ability to do, I freaked the fuck out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vcil9kxoyax61.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c50088143246cfe6c270f5d6b66380aa8d837d7\n\nI'm still not sure what happened that day, but E\\*TRADE admitted it was an \"error\" on their end. Huh, what kind of error results in a massive (and impossible) short position on the biggest stock explosion in decades? There wasn't even an order # attached to the trades...imagine being someone who checks their portfolio weekly or monthly rather than 60 times a day, and seeing this shit pop up, not knowing if you made some terrible mistake and your life was completely ruined?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li4mkcn61bx61.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc1c9b50fcd678eb7f9a798cc2fd16bcf218966\n\nWell a few months had passed, but last week I decided I finally wanted to upgrade my account to a margin account to allow me to sell a *PMCC* on a deep ITM $NIO call I owned. I had the cash available for the trade I wanted to make (a few thousand), so this shouldn't have been an issue. But like clockwork, the PMCC I sold for **19 FUCKING DOLLARS IN PREMIUM** resulted in another error. A Fed Call, for... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvmte0tk0bx61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e561f141eebe3292b7a20f21baa62d7f731b76\n\n**...$21,554.07!** Again, after contacting E\\*TRADE and looking up whatever a \"Fed Call\" was, it was deemed to be yet another \"error\" on their end. The only trade I had made when margin was enabled was a profitable one, too. **$8.** No wonder this country has a mental health problem, thanks E\\*TRADE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sure, Jan.](https://preview.redd.it/dkz2l0741bx61.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b12cfa9084bd7ec6a32332284c9d25e96ce96b93)\n\nOkay, the fed call thing was ridiculous, so the day after I was approved for the margin account, I downgraded my account (after all the trades had settled) so I wouldn't have to deal with this nonsense. I thought that would be the end of it. Until this morning, when I woke up to *\\*drumroll please\\*,* **over $4,000 in cash missing from my account!** I was the lucky winner of the E\\*TRADE lottery, because of all the times I've had to contact support for their \"issues\", I got to pay 1 months salary to a random E\\*TRADE employee! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Thank you, have a nice day!](https://preview.redd.it/0bwntrqx2bx61.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63eb6e29eda6d955e9d733854cfe97a7d4157093)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I write this, the cash has since been deposited back into my account, but how is this acceptable? If the average person looks at their retirement account once a month and sees a hundred thousand dollar cash call, or a twenty thousand dollar 'Fed Call', they may not act rationally - that's a lot of fucking money. And they'd have no idea if it was an error or not because you would ASSUME that a multi, multi billion dollar brokerage wouldn't make mistakes like this...or maybe not.\n\nI guess the point of this post is to remind people to **be careful**. Up until recently, this hasn't been an industry where regular people had access to these resources, and it seems like they wish it stayed that way.",

[The post-COVID boom is starting.](https://www.appraisalbuzz.com/biggest-construction-boom-since-2006-best-2-weeks-for-rates-in-a-year/) The rotation out of tech is under way. And analysts are finally coming to their senses and raising estimates of steel companies, because:\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n**Steel prices are obscenely high**\n\nThese are literally record high steel prices. This mean serious profit. Imagine if people were willing to pay Apple 2 to 3 times as much for an iPhone. [Price of steel 2009 \u2013 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2sRd8M1.png) \n\nAnd this is not just for the moment, but for the rest of the year and beyond. There are record high steel futures as well, and they are only rising. [Future steel futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html) \n\nThis means that people expect steel prices to be high in the future. They are paying these prices right now for steel months away, because they expect this locked-in price to be cheaper than the actual price of steel (however many months/years away).\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Inflation**\n\nThe hot topic right now.  [Global economic rebound is fueling a blistering commodities rally.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)  Will the Fed be able to control inflation? Many expect inflation to climb regardless as there has been so much money printed. During periods of high inflation, Michael Burry thinks you want to be in [real estate and commodities](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859/photo/1). \n\nAnd even if inflation doesn\u2019t cross 3%, the fear of it will drive people to hedge part of their portfolio in commodities.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**China's rebate**\n\nIn 2020, China produced 56.5% of the world\u2019s steel. This was helped by a 13% rebate on all steel exported. Sell steel for $100, get $100 from the buyer and $13 from the government.\n\nBut now China wants to cut their steel production to deal with smog. \n\nStarting May 1st 2021 (6 days ago!), there is a now 0% import tariff &amp; 20-25% export tariff on materials. This is great news for vertically integrated steel companies like CLF and MT than mine their own ore. Not great news for other steel companies that need to buy iron ore- the price of ore is already high and now it\u2019s getting a lot worse.\n\nStarting May 1st 2021, the Chinese rebate for exported steel will be cut from 13% to 0%. If China is cutting their steel production, they still want to grow and build, so they want to keep as much steel inside China as possible. This is amazing news for steel companies outside of China, as their major competitor\u2019s product just got the equivalent of 13% more expensive.\n\nSources (you will need to translate this):\n\n[zero import tariff rate for pig iron, crude steel, recycled steel raw materials... export tariffs for ferrosilicon, ferrochrome, high-purity pig iron and other products are appropriately increased, and the export tax rate of 25% and 20%...](http://gss.mof.gov.cn/gzdt/zhengcejiedu/202104/t20210428_3694153.htm) \n\nand\n\n[The announcement regarding the cancellation of export tax rebates for some steel products is hereby announced as follows: From May 1, 2021, the export tax rebate for some steel products will be cancelled. See the attachment for the specific product list. The specific execution time shall be defined by the export date indicated on the export goods declaration form.](http://m.mof.gov.cn/czxw/202104/t20210428_3694213.htm) \n\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Where in particular to invest?** \n\nSteel in general will make a killing in 2021 and beyond. A commodities [supercycle.](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r0r28fl471c5/are-we-witnessing-the-start-of-a-new-commodities-supercycle#:~:text=Commodity%20super%20cycles%20are%20decade,their%20long%2Dterm%20price%20trend.)\n\nThere is good reason to look more closely at CLF (US company) and MT (European company). CLF recently jumped 10% a few days ago and is now consolidating. CLF is generally more of an upward pointed rollercoaster while MT is a gentler climb.\n\nCLF and MT are vertically integrated and mine their own ore. For the most part they have better financials than many of their competitors, and have invested more into their futures. MT is actively buying back shares while CLF's CEO LG said on his last call they will \"look after shareholders\" after aggressively paying down their debt. It won't take long, they are making a ton of money.\n\nCLF has the benefit of a firebrand CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, who actively looks out for investors. Additionally, the U.S. infrastructure bill is going to require an incredibly large amount of (US) steel. In the short term, speeches involving this bill and the passing of the bill will be major catalysts, and in the long term the profits from the bill will be reflected in earnings reports for years.\n\nAs people seem to put (far too much) weight on short interest, some might want to know that CLF has short interest of 11.26% as reported by Ortex. Those shorters are hurting and are going to need to buy their way out soon. \n\nMT released quarterly earnings today and did amazingly, beating already sky-high estimates by an additional 20%. Their best quarter in a decade.

That is a direct result of a U.K. Supreme Court ruling in March that led Uber to classify tens of thousands of drivers in the U.K. as employees.\n\nUber disclosed in March that it could have to pay claims of back pay due from British drivers in the case, including holiday pay, wages to equal the minimum and, potentially, pension contributions. That would be on top of what the company already paid the drivers in the 2016 case.\n\nThat puts a dollar figure on a longstanding concern about Uber and the other \u201cgig work\u201d companies \u2014 what it would look like financially if they had to treat drivers as employees. And it is nothing to sneeze at, blowing away the $200 million Uber and other gig companies spent to pass a new law in California in their quest for a \u201cthird way\u201d for employment law. That win could be moot, though, as President Joe Biden\u2019s new secretary of the Labor Department said last week drivers should receive the benefits of employment in most cases, spooking some investors.\n\nFor more: Here is how the Biden administration could change gig work\n\nUber shares initially went higher in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the company papered over the \u201caccrual\u201d and continuing losses with the $1.6 billion sale of its self-driving unit, but fell back to a 4.8% decline in the extended session as executives discussed increasing costs for drivers and faced an immediate question about Labor Secretary Marty Walsh\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the makeup of the current administration, it\u2019s fair to say that there are individuals who have varying views on these issues. They\u2019re not all identical in their outlook. And we think that creates space for some meaningful dialogue,\u201d said Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West, who worked in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe company\u2019s standard mantra when asked about the possible costs of classifying its drivers as employees has been to say that they will pass on the costs to its users, which executives said again during Wednesday\u2019s call. They noted that they did see a slight increase in costs in the quarter, because of driver benefits, and they were able to pass those costs on to riders, with no impact on demand.\n\nSee also: Uber and Lyft are public, so the cheap rides are coming to an end\n\n\u201cWe are leaning in, with investments to support the recovery mobility and growth initiatives and delivery,\u201d said Uber Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai, noting that the ride-hailing company plans to invest in its driver base, and increase its spending in general, marketing and administrative costs, and in R&amp;D. Chai estimated Uber will spend between $450 million and $480 million in the second quarter, after a drop in spending last quarter. Also included will be spending on marketing to attract new drivers, as it faces driver shortages in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nAt the same time, Chai noted that the company continues to face \u201csignificant forecasting uncertainty and predicting posts reopening consumer behavior.\u201d\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said that investors were not happy with the higher spending, and pointed to the U.K. charge/accrual as highlighting the hot-button issue of possible further regulation over the classification of its drivers.\n\n\u201cHigher level of investments near term, coupled with some uncertainty around the forecast,\u201d were affecting the shares in after-hours trading, Ives said in an email. \u201cIt was a robust print, but after the Biden move against gig players, the Street is very nervous around Uber and Lyft, with selling post-quarter a theme commonplace during tech earnings season.\u201d\n\nEven so, investors now have an idea of how much drivers being classified as employees could cost the company. As the debate over gig workers continues, investors will likely remain jittery about the issue. The nagging question above all is, will companies like Uber and Lyft Inc. LYFT, -6.34% ever be profitable, with their contractor business models again at risk, and prone to big, unexpected costs?",

Management is seeing \u201ccontinued momentum in 5G rollouts across all geographies, especially North America.\u201d And from the favorable margins in Nokia\u2019s 5G products, gross margin in mobile networks improved 2.1% from last year, reaching 33.2% during the quarter.\n\nAnd Nokia\u2019s AI-enabled chip ReefShark \u2013 which is used to power Nokia\u2019s 5G base stations \u2013 made up 44% of 5G sales.

Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why buy?**\n\n$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. \n\nThey say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. \n\nAs a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chip shortage.**\n\nThe elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. \n\nBut I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final thought**\n\nEnd of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.\n\nAs always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cznh9hm6j3x61.png?width=1384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f982f936b4337cca2f1b63452b526fc0045cda1b",

So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9\n\n Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan\u201921 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. \n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007\n\n Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.\n\n**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.\n\n**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.\n\n**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm \u2013 Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.\n\n**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.\n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nCan I use the code/is it open source: Yes.\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "So, let me get this straight. We criticized MVIS for having a \u201clarge\u201d 2b market cap and so now we all suddenly support Nokia with a market cap of 25.1b? That\u2019s 12x more than MVIS. \n\nNOK Income statement for year ended 2020:\n\nRatio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 13,659,000/21,852,000 = 62.5%. This means 62.5% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 37.5% is what the company kept as gross profit. \n\nMVIS income statement for year ended 2020:\n\nRatio of cost of revenue to total revenue: \n1,398/3090 = 45.24%. This means 45.24% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 54.76% is what the company kept as gross profit.\n\nAll prices listed from income statements are in millions of dollars. Yes Nokia is bringing home more money, but they aren\u2019t raking it in as efficiently as MVIS. Because MVIS is a much much smaller company than NOK, their differences in the dollar amount of gross profit is to be understood. But my original statement still stands, MVIS is \u201ctaking home a bigger % of their pie\u201d for profits, because they are better than NOK at mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs. \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at their D./T.A. Ratio. This will give us insight to which degree debt is used to finance assets for each company. The lower the ratio, the better the company is at using that debt to finance assets.\n\nNOK DTA: 6,486,000/36,191,000 = 17.92%. This means, in laymen\u2019s terms, that for every $100 of assets, NOK accumulated $17.92 in debt. \n\nMVIS DTA: 3,107/21,006 = 14.79% This means, in laymen\u2019s terms, that for every $100 of assets, MVIS accumulated $14.79 in debt. \n\nMVIS does a much better job, as previously stated, at mitigating losses and staying efficient. Not to mention, because MVIS is researching extremely new technology, much of their funding will be for R&amp;D - much more R&amp;D is needed for sensors that didn\u2019t exist a few years ago, over the R&amp;D needed for a new phone or cellular service which has already been around for decades. If MVIS is able to have a lower DTA ratio, developing \u201cnew to this world\u201d technology, than a company that has been making phones longer than we\u2019ve been alive, then how is it a bad buy? How is NOK a better buy?\n\nI know typically DDs are not suppose to take into account the comparison between other stocks, but too many of you have fallen into this NOK train that will leave you at a $4.50+ cost basis, and suddenly NOK will start trading sideways at $4.10 for the next coming years, and you\u2019re nah holding. Have fun making 3 cents a share per year. That\u2019s pussy shit I didn\u2019t come here for. \n\nNot financial advice, I literally failed Finance 304. Professor was an ass.",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 3) - $AMC, $ROKU, $SQ, $ETSY, $Z, $PTON, $RKT, $CRSR, $MT, and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 3 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI fucking love earnings season. It\u2019s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What\u2019s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they\u2019re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\n\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their \"true\" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.\n\n- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.\n\n- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraid. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.\n\n- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.\n\n- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin\u2019 companies, theres plenty that I\u2019ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I\u2019d love to see what you guys come up with.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there\u2019s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",

        "selftext": "Here\u2019s something interesting to consider from a more technical options standpoint: right now there is unusually high open interest in CLOV calls (a significant portion being out of the money). These calls are often written by market makers, who need to hedge their short calls by purchasing stock. As you know, gamma squeezes occur as the stock rises and more of these call options go in the money and the whales buy up stock to hedge their risk. Here is another part of the puzzle many people are missing: the amount of stock they buy to hedge is often related to the delta of the option (so they can remain delta neutral). Hence, the higher the delta of a contract, the more shares the market maker needs to buy in order to hedge the risk. Here\u2019s another fact: vanna (the second order Greek, measuring delta sensitivity with respect to implied volatility) is (typically) positive. This means that if implied volatility goes up, delta will go up, and market makers will have to purchase more shares to remain market neutral. Now here\u2019s the kicker: as earnings approach, implied volatility will usually, particularly in shorter term contracts, skyrocket. Couple this with the fact that the May 21 expiration is very close to earnings, deltas across the board will quite possibly rise substantially in the days before earnings, forcing market makers to buy up huge chunks of stock to hedge, and hence potentially driving up the price by a tremendous deal.\n\nThis is all speculation. I cannot stress enough that there is no guarantee that this is the case. This theory could fail for a number of reasons: these calls may simply be retail investors who aren\u2019t bound by any delta neutral strategies or anything of the sort; the stock may drop before earnings and hence the increase in implied volatility could fail to offset the change in underlying's effect on delta; the market makers simply buy the calls back at a premium from paper-handed option buyers, taking a loss; or there is sufficient downward pressure/selling momentum at the time that the market makers could simply buy a lot of stock without drastically increasing the price. That's why I need to say: please please please only invest if you genuinely believe in the stock and can afford to lose whatever you put in. The stock market is risky business - nothing is guaranteed and you can always lose a lot of money if you make poor decisions. In fact, you can lose a lot of money even if you make really good decisions and the market turns against you.\n\n(This is not financial advice - please do your own due diligence and only risk capital you can actually afford to lose. I myself have invested about 10k in LEAPs, short term options, and then another few thousand in shares.)",

        "selftext": "Right now, I see a unique options play on RKT earnings. If you were to acquire some OTM call options for the may 7th 23.50 strike, if the calls go in the money and you pay 50 bucks for each contract, we are talking just about 47x ROI over a 5 day or less time period. \n\nCurrent vol and open interest on the call side is rather high. We are not seeing a ton of trading volume for the shares of RKT, but I personally believe this is the calm before the storm. \n\nTherefore - I believe the price of RKT call options are grossly mispriced and the potential for the stock to move 10% or higher shortly before and after earnings is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-40%. Historically this has happened before so it's not outside the realm of possibility. Because the stock stays stable for so long, calls are much cheaper than gambling on something like MVIS or GME (I guess due to implied volatility being lower comparatively). \n\nThe keener among you may have seen how this played out with short dated Tesla options on last Friday. The stock was trading down.. then did a complete upwards reversal, turning 1500 dollar call options into 30-50000 dollars in one day. \n\nUsually I never take the risk on short dated OTM calls but this time it's different. I think there is too much evidence stacking up to the fact that RKT has something under their sleeves for this earnings call. Fundmentally I expect a strong beat.. but they could also announce another special dividend or stock buyback. This is your time to buy the rumor sell the news. \n\nTLDR, buy lots of RKT call options expiring 5/7 at the 23.50 strike or higher  \n\n# \ud83d\ude80 \n\n# \ud83d\ude80 \n\n# \ud83d\ude80 \n\n# \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)\n\nBelow is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):\n\n1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let\u2019s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) \u2013 a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover\u2019s business model is so fool proof!  \n***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***\n2. **Competition:** Now let\u2019s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.  \n***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***\n3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover\u2019s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.  \n***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***\n4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let\u2019s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/) in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this\u2026as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn\u2019t\u2026.60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover\u2019s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).  \n***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***\n5. **Customers:** Let\u2019s now put some light on the target demographic\u2026seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.\n6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance\u2026except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money\u2026now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.\n7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock \u2013 he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as a board member.**\n8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \\~$3B, which is \\~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover\u2019s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated\u2026upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond\u2026.it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space \u2013 TDOC \u2013 and a Cathie Wood &amp; ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.  \n***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***\n\nI am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.",

        "selftext": "Today, I will cover $ASTS, [AST Space Mobile](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf). The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space, they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms $1T in TAM.\n\n*Why should you care?*\n\nThe recent market hit to high growth/speculative plays has not spared ASTS. This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately $1.2B (cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at $1.4B).\n\nThe company represents the most asymmetric risk/reward play on the market right now. It will either 20x-100x or go bust. Let me explain if they get only 1% of their TAM, which is ~$10B then at a cheap (assuming about 80% net margin, thanks to their 90% EBITDA margin) P/E ratio of 12x ([telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)), it gives the company a $96B market capitalization, representing an 80x opportunity.\n\n*Alright\u2026 100x if everything goes well, right?*\n\nYes, let me tell you why I and many others (some incredible DD from other investors like u/apan-man) think that the company will succeed. Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC-like risk/reward exposure, I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC (desirability, feasibility, and viability).\n\n**Desirability**\n\n*Targeted Segment*\n\nTheir satellites will offer services to large telecom companies, which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers. Think of AST\u2019s satellites like 5G towers in space.\nOf the currently 5B existing end users, the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Rakuten, Telefonica, Ooredoo, Telstra, and others.\n\nTo put this a bit into perspective, the only other company really trying to achieve that is [Lynk](https://lynk.global/), but they have only $10M in funding compared to $464M for ASTS, and currently do not have any commercial agreements.\n\n*Customer Relationships &amp; Channels*\n\nAll the customer relationship services, as well as sales efforts, are done by the carriers. Basically, AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage. This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive.\n\n*Value Proposition*\n\nDesigned to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones.\nImagine watching hot tub streams on the plane.\n\n**Feasibility**\n\n*Key Partners*\n\nIn the value chain, AST designs, integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components.\nThey will use any available launch services such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, Ariane, etc. The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks. Moreover, the main reason why the space-based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever-decreasing launch costs ([price to send a kg of payload in space](https://www.futuretimeline.net/data-trends/images/rocket-launch-costs-trend.jpg)).\n\nRegarding financial and strategic partners, the company has received funding from Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12-month lock-up.\n\n*Key Activities*\n\nAST will design and integrate the satellites. The company\u2019s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry, they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model.\n\nOf course, their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023. Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements. To give you an idea, on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers.\n\nFuture agreements won\u2019t be mutually exclusive (like with Vodafone), so they can add as many carriers as they want.\n\n*Key Resources*\n\nTalent, technology, and funding.\n\nAbel Avellan is not much of a salesman, but he is a genius, he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work.\n\nAs mentioned previously, they managed to attract funding from Vodafone, American Tower, and Rakuten. Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST\u2019s technology and has concluded that it works.\n\nFor further funding, ASTS is participating in the [$9B 5G rural fund for America](http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&amp;f_number=SATPDR2020041300034). They currently have the support of 7 senators (bipartisan) and AT&amp;T. In my opinion, there is the potential for AST to get about $1B in non-dilutive funding from the government, which would significantly accelerate the company\u2019s plan for global coverage.\n\n**Viability**\n\n*Revenue Streams*\n\nRevenues come from an agreement with telecom providers, basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee. The end-user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites.\n\n*Cost Structure*\n\nBecause the satellites are in LEO orbit, they will need to be changed every 5-7 years. The company is working on a way to repair/extend the lifetime of existing satellites.\n\n**The long-term play**\n\nShares, shares, shares.\n\n**The short-term play**\n\nThe stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the stock has a relatively small float and could be very explosive on any news, such as new carrier agreements, analyst coverage, etc.\nAbel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers\u2019 agreement and the silent period ends this Friday.\n\nTL;DR $ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right, either 100x or 0x in a few years\n\nDisclosure: 35,000 shares",

        "selftext": " People seem confused about Nikola\u2019s worth. Let\u2019s try to clear things up. \n\nTo get into the EV stocks, best thing is to understand a bit about EV\u2019s.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between: electric vehicles, powered electric vehicles and plug-in vehicles?  Also what is the difference between hydrogen vehicles and electric vehicles? So, here is a simple explanation. \n\n**Electric, power electric and plug-in are all the same**: They run on electricity,  use a lithium battery and **need to be re-charged by plugging them into a socket.** \n\n**The hydrogen vehicles are also electric.** But, instead of a lithium battery, they have a hydrogen tank that produces the electricity. So they are similar to regular vehicles in that, **when needed, you fill up the tank, just, instead of gas, you fill it up with hydrogen.**\n\n**Pros of hydrogen vehicles?** It takes five minutes to fill up the tank.There isn\u2019t a \u201crange\u201d problem with them. In theory, you can drive them very long distances as long as you have a hydrogen station along the way.\n\nAs opposed to lithium batteries. You can drive a Tesla about 200 miles before you need to recharge it. Yep, Tesla will tell you it\u2019s 400 miles, but practically, it\u2019s 200 (400 would be if you are driving alone, no passengers, in a straight line with nothing stopping you all the way, (like a traffic light) or slowing you down (like slopes, curves, bad weather). \n\nThis is a HUGE difference. Think about it. 200 miles is a 3 hour drive at 70 miles per hour. If you have a 4 hour drive, you will need to recharge the battery for AT LEAST one hour, and probably way more. Your 4 hour drive just turned into a 7-8 or more hours\u2026And that is IF you have where to charge along the way.\n\nA hydrogen car you just need to refill the tank and be on your way. That sounds awesome. \n\n**Where is the catch**? Well, there are about 40000 electric charging stations in the USA. That is a solid number when compared to a bit over 100,000 regular gas stations. So, if you own an electric car, you have a decent chance of charging it. Although it might take you 4-8 hours, don\u2019t forget. \n\nMeanwhile, there are like...wait for it...45 hydrogen stations in all of the USA. So, basically, if you have a hydrogen car (you don\u2019t, it\u2019s really experimental at this point), you don\u2019t have where to fill up your tank. \n\nThe other problem with hydrogen vehicles: to \u201cproduce\u201d the hydrogen, you need power. It doesn\u2019t just \u201cexist\u201d. So you need to \u201cmanufacture\u201d it, so to speak. Nowadays, that costs too much. That is ONE reason Elon Musk says hydrogen cars are stupid. (He is only right as long as making hydrogen remains expensive\u2026)\n\n**But electric cars also have some important issues:**\n\nYou see, creating electricity has a price. That price depends on how you create that energy. Some electricity is super cheap, like that created using the sun, the wind or even nuclear energy. Others are expensive. Some countries have lots of electricity, others don\u2019t. Some can create clean electricity. Others need to pollute the air in order to make electricity.\n\nSo 1st problem: electricity. If all cars would be electric cars, it would be a HUGE problem to provide electricity from a plug to all of them. In most countries or states, that wouldn\u2019t work at all.\n\n2nd huge issue with all electric cars: where to charge them. If you live in a house, have a garage, no problems. You come home, plug it in, go to sleep, in the morning the car is charged. \n\nBut if you live in an apartment building, if you park your car in the street,  if you are too busy cause when you get back from work, you son/wife etc. take the car to do shopping, night studies, night job, whatever, when and where are you going to charge the car?\n\nBottom line: the biggest problem with electric CARS is that if everyone will have them, it will eat up too much electricity, there will be nowhere to charge them, and even worse, no time to charge them. Not everyone can have an electric car, gas cars aren\u2019t disappearing that quickly. Too many private electric cars are going to become a huge headache. \n\nBut trucks on the other hand\u2026.let\u2019s think about it. Everyone wants to make electric trucks (or large vans) why? Well, it\u2019s a smaller, more manageable fleet.  They are parked at designated spots or parking lots, easier to charge in that sense, the gas/money you save by turning a truck electric as opposed to a car, is much larger, and the truck brings in revenue so that even if it\u2019s expensive, companies can offset that cost. \n\n**So now we understand:** \n\n1. Electric cars are awesome cause they are friendly to the environment, easy to maintain, and as soon as the lithium batteries become less expensive (they will, technology is making them cheaper by the day), you will be able to afford one!\n2. Electric cars aren\u2019t THAT awesome because it takes time and lots of electricity to charge them. Good luck doing a movie about a road trip using an electric car. You\u2019ll have plenty of shots of people waiting at a charging station and making small-talk\u2026\n3. Hydrogen cars can solve the charging issue except that there are no hydrogen fill up stations (almost) and hydrogen is expensive as a solution right now.\n4. The private electric car market is huge and awesome, just not as huge and as awesome as Elon Musk wants you to think it is.\n5. Trucks are actually a better market for electric vehicles in the mid-term / current long term outlook. Whoever makes a good electric truck/van is going to be in an excellent position.\n6. Equally, whoever develops hydrogen fueled cars best, will have an upper hand. \n\n**Which brings us to Nikola**. And what it has or doesn\u2019t have. One could argue that Nikola is just a bunch of ideas. And nothing else. \n\nBut that isn\u2019t accurate. \n\nThey actually have several patents to their name. Some of them are more related to visuals. What the truck would LOOK like. But others are about real technology. This is a big deal in a field that is all about new technology. If you own some of the concepts of how to transform that idea into a product, if you own that patent, then that can be worth a lot of money.\n\nNikola is suing Tesla for using some of its patents (the ones related to how the truck looks, not how it runs). Though the lawsuit has been ongoing for years and might keep going for a few more years, down the road it seems very probable that Tesla will need to pay Nikola a sizeable payday.\n\nSo Nikola has some value because of its patents, it\u2019s a real player in this new technology. \n\nThe 2nd thing we know for sure is Nikola is building a factory, and that factory is in fact being built, and it will start producing something, pretty soon. We need to understand what that something is....\n\nNikola is aiming at building an electric truck. So is Tesla. Also Ford, Daimler, Volvo...this is a market where many big names want to make a splash. And then there is Rivian. They have a 100,00 truck order (!!) from Amazon. And their IPO is coming out this year. \n\n**So now that we are EV \u201cexperts\u201d, what is Nikola worth?**\n\nNo one has a reasonable, practical EV truck (maybe except BYD. But I don\u2019t trust Chinese companies, because they do not operate with transparency, they\u2019re fishy to me). Whomever gets a good EV truck on the road is bound to see a pretty nice spike in stock value. \n\nRivian is planning on an IPO setting its initial value at 50 billion. Mind you, this is a company that has a 100,000 truck order for a truck that doesn\u2019t exist yet. Its development is advanced, and they are hoping to deliver the truck to the market in the next few months. But 50 billion, considering this number can easily go to 70 as soon as the IPO is launched, is a lot of money. \n\nNikola\u2019s current value is at 4.5 billion. They are building a factory, they have hired many, many professionals, they have patents that show they understand the technology very well, they have experience building the prototypes (through which they got the patents). They are potentially a very, very cheap stock. \n\nJust news of the factory actually working and any kind of initial pre-order doubles the price of this stock. Hold it for 2-3 years, the chances for a tenfold valuation is reasonable. \n\nAs far as Nikola\u2019s hydrogen trucks. I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. They need to set up the infrastructure to have hydrogen stations for filling up the tank at a national level. That is just billions of dollars in costs. They need to create the technology that lowers the cost of providing the hydrogen. That still doesn\u2019t exist at a satisfying level. I wouldn\u2019t build on that as an investor. If they do somehow get that going, their value increases through the roof. But if they start focusing on it too much, they could waste lots of money, like they have done before. \n\n**Bottom line:** NKLA isn\u2019t as dead as people think, IMO. It has value, it has a real plan, it\u2019s focusing on the right market (the trucks) and it will be worth way more. It isn\u2019t going up anytime soon. But it\u2019s a good time to get in. \n\nI\u2019m not an advisor, I do not own NKLA stocks right now but plan on owning a position at some point in 2021. I just thought people would benefit from understanding this EV thing better.",

        "selftext": "Hear me out apes I think I may of found an exploit that can be utilized for maximize leverage with downside protection through housing.\n\nFirst you take advantage of the historically booming mortgage market and low interest rates by taking out as many mortgages as you can afford through a mortage brokers tied to a public traded stock (RKT for example).  Then using the houses that you now own you take out additional loans which you use the proceeds to wheel (sell calls/puts) into gold/silver/platinum.  As you keep gathering more premium and your house values goes up slowly (while interest rates mostly stay stagnant as the feds are afraid of crashing the market) you take out more loans and sell more puts.  Hopefully by the time the housing market crashes your wheeling account will have accumulated enough in value to pay off its mortagages on it own through wheeling.  Since gold and other commodities tend to go up during market/housing crashes during the downturn you will be able to pay off your mortagages through the gains you will see in your wheeling account.  If housing keeps booming you keep getting more loans out (or sell/pay them off to reduce risk and realize gains).  At some point later you you sell your housing for nice gains or refinance and take our more mortgages.  If things go sideways your wheeling premiums will keep you afloat, while you slowly whittle away at your mortagages.  \n\nThe way I see it is your houses you buy is almost like buying a LEAP call so you can sell options covered. \n\nAm i missing something here?  I feel like this is a guaranteed way to make money in this volatile market in the long term.",

        "selftext": "I cringe every time I read that we\u2019re in a rotation \u201cfrom growth to cyclical\u201d or \u201cfrom lockdown to reopening\u201d stocks. Those narratives would suggest that restaurants, hotels, airlines, and auto manufacturers are all flying high right now. The problem is, none if it is true.\n\nSince February\u2026\n\n* Tripadvisor, Expedia, and Booking are flat\n* Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt are flat\n* Ford, GM, and Toyota are flat\n* Restaurants are mixed\n* Airlines are down\n\nThe real rotation isn\u2019t toward any of that. If you put conventional labels aside, this is really a rotation from feel-good stocks to feel-bad stocks. Since February, anything young people actually want to invest in has been annihilated: technology, e-commerce, semiconductors, renewable energy, cannabis, disruptive tech, EVs, and so on. Even if you exclude all the speculation and only include profitable, well-established companies, this is still very much the case.\n\nWhat has done well? Energy, financials, materials, and industrials. In other words, dirty money. Gas and oil = drivers of climate change, financials = sharky capitalism, industrials and materials = environmental degradation and warfare. It's almost like the more nefarious the business model is, the better! (Lockheed is up 16% since March 1. Northrop is up over 25%. Feels bad.)\n\nNow, I know what some of you are thinking \u2013 some version of \u201cthe stock market isn\u2019t the place to change the world.\u201d I'm just making an observation. It\u2019s kind of a \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, do you join \u2018em?\u201d moment. Will this rotation be a short-term blip or a long drawn out shift away from feel-good investing?",

        "selftext": "Hi here I want to tell you about what I think is the most undervalued stock right now. It can be a huge value play here\u2019s why:\n\nGROWTH : 37% yoy in revenues, cloud business with now positive Ebita and growing at 50%.\n\nThe company operates in the online-retail market (mainly) in China, which is expected to grow its GDP and surpass the USA in 2028.\n\nDebt and Moat: Low debt, can pay all its debt with cash, so it can be considered a financial fortress as Buffett uses to say.\n\nAlibaba has definitely a moat with can be seen from different points of view:\n\n1) Network effect = The fact that the 53% of online- retail sales is from Alibaba and its platform creates a continuous increase in the number of users.\n\n2)Barriers to entry= In this market there are only few players becoming a sort of oligopoly.\n\n3)Economies of scale= Alibaba has shown its ability to scale, and so to increase its revenues without decreasing its profit margins, and it is able to grow and at the same time to reduce the \u201cper-product-cost\u201d.\n\n4) Substitution costs= Alibaba operates with online- salers which probably have made investments in order to position themselves in the Alibaba platforms, and it could be a huge cost to change platform.\n\nPRICE: Alibaba trades at 25/26 PE, forward PE of  20. And here nothing else to say. Considered the future growth is very cheap.\n\nWHY IT IS UNDERVALUED: It is undervalued because market hates uncertainty and I think that the market fears are \n\nA) Usa-China relationships\n\nB)CCP, because it is mainly a dictatorship and for example the ccp can do whatever he whats with its companies and population\n\n\u2014&gt; WHY THE MARKET IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE: \n\nCCP is in continuous competition with USA, and I think that it will never destroy his \u201cdiamond tips - companies like BABA or Tencent.\n\nCCP ,as Charlie Munger said at BRK annual meeting in Los Angeles, has discovered the \u201cformula\u201d that is a form of economic-regulated capitalism.\n\nFor these reasons I think baba is hugely undervalued and as its fair price could be 320/330$ per ADR share.\n\nP.S.\nSorry for my English, I am Italian\ud83d\ude02",

        "selftext": "I have seen lots of RKT posts and comments, and have made quite a few myself. While I do believe it goes way up tomorrow, ($35-$40ish), I think Thursday is really the day to watch. Rocket is launching Rocket Auto soon and for some reason it\u2019s rarely mentioned in these Rocket posts except for the ones with thorough DD. Please realize this isn\u2019t just funding car loans, they will actually be SELLING CARS online as well. It\u2019s similar to Carvana. The potential for their revenue to increase 50-100% in the next year exists with that. And, there is no reason to doubt they will take over market share there just as they have with mortgages.\n\n Now, back to why you should hold after close tomorrow... I fully expect them to announce the launch date for the Rocket Auto division along with some details and guidance around it tomorrow afternoon. Obviously the stock is already severely undervalued, but factor in the coming soon Rocket Auto and we should really be $60-$70. RKT is at the bottom now and has traded around $22 for 2 months straight. Is there really downside risk to holding? I don\u2019t think so. TBH if you hang on to it a few more months you could probably triple your money.

        "selftext": "To say we had an interesting few weeks in the uranium sector would be a massive understatement. We have seen new geopolitical support for nuclear power and a massive new catalyst in the form of the newly formed Sprott Uranium Trust (more on that later). There was also a new version released of the Bear Traps Report, a popular type of newsletter that in the words of John Quakes is \u201csend to thousands of Wall Street money managers\u201d. It is also believed that the initial run up was sparked by the sharing of a similar Bear Traps Report article around November/December of last year, sparking the first leg up with institutional capital positioning in the sector. There is \\*a lot\\* happening beneath the surface and the coming few months will, in my view, prove to be significant.\n\nHere is the first part of the Bear Traps Report with my own added comments as well:\n\nIn 2020, six nuclear reactors were connected to the gnd. Of these, Belarus and the UAE opened their first nuclear reactors. This, despite the pandemic. We expect this trend to continue over the balance of the century. There are currently 108 planned nuclear reactors globally at various stages of the approval funding process. Different countries get different percentages from nuclear reactors, a sample: China, 4.9%; India, 3.2%, Japan, 7.5%, UK 15.6%, USA, 19.7%. The take away is that between China, the UK and the USA, alone, there is plenty of potential growth in nuclear reactor electricity supply and, of course, these countries have the financial wherewithal to fund the requisite nuclear reactors to go green should consensus so direct.\n\nProduction from mining (in tonnes U) for 2019 was. 22,808 from Kazakhstan: 6,938 from Canada, 6,613 from Australia, 5,476 from Namibia, estimated 3,500 from Uzbekistan 2,983 from Russia, estimated 1,885 from China, 801 from Ukraine, and 67 from the USA Production in the U.S. has been in steady decline: 2014 = 1,919, 2015 = 1,256, 2016 = 1,125, 2017 = 940, 2018 = 582, 2019 = 67. \n\nThe main takeaway here is there is a seemingly strong geopolitical risk component to Uranium supply. U.S. production has essentially evaporated, an extremely bullish fact for forward Uranium pricing given Biden's pro-nuclear stance. Production of Uranium concentrate in the U.S. has fallen steeply and steadily (pounds U308): 2,422,789 for 2017, 1,446,496 for 2018, 173,875 for 2019. In the first quarter of 2020-8,989 vs 58,481 in first quarter 2019 vs 226,780 first quarter 2018 and 450,215 first quarter of 2017.  \n \n\nOverall, nuclear power provides about 11% of global electricity output. Demand grows alapually in the single digits. Because of low prices, global Uranium supply is down 25%. If prices double, mines will reopen and consolidate. If the U.S. alone decides to go big on nuclear prices will at least double. And assuming prices double, supply will be adequate to power U.S. nuclear ambitions. It goes both ways. The U.S. produces but 7% of its own demand, with 93% dependent on imports. \"For strategic issues such as power supply and defense, this is not a healthy situation, and therefore the plan was made for a strategic stockpile, \"Gabi Schneider, the executive director of the Namibian Uranium Institute, explains, adding it is ultimately the US's goal to expand uranium production domestically in order to shrink, or halt outright, U.S. imports of Uranium. \n\nThe U.S. goverment's Uranium strategic stockpile effort passed last December is a key, and telling, first step. At the state level, legislatures have begun passing laws that set up support for nuclear reactors. This represents a big shift from half a century ago. The Biden administration is pro-nuclear power. China's nuclear reactor capacity is set to grow from 46 GWe in 2020 to 108 GWe by 2030. We expect ground to be broken for nuclear reactors over the balance of this decade in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Poland. Projects have begun in Turkey, Bangladesh and Egypt. So it's not just a question of the wealthiest countries jumping in. \n\nConsensus thought on Uranium has been remarkably stupid, missing the supply cuts, missing the 5x move in conversion prices (UF6), missing the 40% rise in SWU (enrichment) prices, and missing the recent run up in spot prices (U308). Basically, consensus can't even think one step ahead when it comes to basic economics. It didn't occur to them that money losing mines would be shut down.\n\nThe US needs to guarantee greater uranium supply. For that it needs U.S. mines to reopen and consolidate. For that Uranium prices have to double. The new U.S. Uranium stockpile could prove a key component to that price shift. Uranium just entered supply deficit Kazakhstan's Uranium production forecast is for its Uranium production to peak next year and to go into serious decline post 2030.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this comes down to one simple fact, it is that we are running out of time for uranium prices to get going and the longer this doesn\u2019t happen, the higher the eventual price overshoot to try and make up for a decade of lost capex investments and exploration. If utilities come to the table within the next 12 months, some form of price control can be asserted and perhaps a slower run up into a price of roughly 60-65 dollars with a small overshoot to around 80 dollars by 2024 might be the most probable scenario. If they don\u2019t though, we might be looking at triple digit uranium once more. One massive new catalyst that was brought to the table recently was the fact the coming into existence of the Sprott Uranium Trust. The bear traps report names 9 reasons why this will likely have significant implications for the broad uranium market:  \n\n\nUranium Participation Corp was a company that was buying U and sitting on it, the original yellow cake. The market will now have daily price discovery and a retail / family office / small asset manager speculation vehicle. This is a game changer. Now we have a new team taking over (Sprott). Very bullish for uranium. Why? Here is why:\n\n1. We are getting a U.S. listed vehicle with a physical redemption Like a GLD for uranium. Look at PSLV and PHYS, equivalent.\n\n2. A new mechanism for retail, institutional. An at the market facility. Technically a closed end fund, NOT a GLD.\n\n3. Pounds come in, don't go out. They could do a buyback if the market provides that opportunity.\n\n4. Uranium Participation Corp is tough to buy, pink sheet. Many online brokers didn\u2019t offer it, but now there will be a new liquidity vehicle that is far more widely available.\n\n5. Management transition from Denison to Sprott. Think Industry player to real asset mgr.\n\n6. When there is large premium new buyers are vulnerable. This has suppressed upside momentum NOW there is a liquid vehicle, large buyers can come in with a liquidity work out.\n\n7. Next, Sprott does a big offering to bring in new pounds into the fund. There was too much inventory of uranium in the system, this vehicle will eliminate this problem. New size buyers of the fund will quickly translate into spot buying!\n\n8. Think CME and oil this could be a new real franchise /a liquidity central facility\n\n9. Management take over might take 2/3 months. Then the premium U Part will come in, was 16% today in a month or so Dan Loeb can come in and buy $100m without the premium risk pounds will permanently be removed from the mkt NOT an ETF, it\u2019s a closed end fund. A discount may develop in the shares but new buyers are in a much better spot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat marks the end of this uranium market update and I hope you enjoyed the read. With so much happening both in front as well as behind the scenes, hopefully I can be of aid to help you traverse this opaque market in the best way possible. We are at the foot of what will undoubtably prove to be a generational event, but it will be an extremely volatile and wild market all the way up and eventually down as well. If you got any questions or comments, my dm\u2019s are always open. As always I wish you all a good and healthy rest of your day and good luck out there in the markets, cheers!",

This is the big  catalyst we've been waiting for so people can finally stop being  confused when they start researching FOMO Corp. No more old  baggage!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nChange will be listed on the daily list tomorrow, May 6th. Will take effect May 7th, 2021!!!!!! That's this friday....\n\nFOMO FRIDAY!!\n\nSay  goodbye to sub-penny land!! I'm not going to speculate on where this  will run to in the coming days, but it won't be below a penny for long.  Today's close 0.007 .... won't be this low for long tomorrow morning  IMHO.\n\nBTW, to know if the ticker  change is happening for sure just search for the \"FINRA daily change  list\" and you should find it posted tomorrow, May 6th, for confirmation.  (or just visit this link: [https://otce.finra.org/otce/dailyList?viewType=Symbol%2FName%20Changes](https://otce.finra.org/otce/dailyList?viewType=Symbol%2FName%20Changes) )\n\nPlease  note, anything said above are my opinions, views, etc and are not  trading advice. I'm not a professional... just someone who pays  attention and does their DD. ALWAYS DO YOUR OWN DD.\n\n:::(Begin Copy/Paste):::\n\nThe  most significant news for FOMO CORP. from the past week: 1. On May 5,  2021, we were notified by FINRA of the following pending corporate  action:\n\n\u201cNew Name: FOMO CORP.\n\nNew Symbol: FOMC\n\nNEW CUSIP: 344429105\n\nCurrent CUSIP: 90214L106 (Please confirm current CUSIP is to be suspended upon market effectiveness)\n\nDaily List Announcement Date: May 6, 2021\n\nMarket Effective Date: May 7, 2021\u201d\n\n**Please  note that FOMO CORP. and the Transfer Agent have confirmed the above  information is accurate, per FINRA\u2019s request. We are expecting, but have  not yet received, final confirmation from FINRA. I would like to thank  everyone for their patience with this lengthy process.**\n\n2.  On May 3, 2021, FOMO CORP. filed an 8K stating it had applied for  uplisting of its common stock to the OTC QB market. The Company believes  OTC QB uplisting, if approved subject to exchange requirements, will  expand its addressable investor base and provide a more efficient market  for its common stock, though there are no assurances. Once the company  has maintained a closing bid price of at least $.01 for 30 consecutive  calendar days, the company will submit an updated application.\n\n3.  On May 3, 2021, FOMO CORP. filed an 8K/A extending the deadline to  close a definitive agreement to acquire a national HVAC services  contractor to July 1, 2021. Terms of the letter of intent (\u201cLOI\u201d) had  been filed as an 8K with the target\u2019s name redacted, as per mutual  agreement. Future closing terms and structure are under negotiation.\n\n4.  On May 3, 2021, FOMO CORP. filed an 8K stating it had signed a term  sheet for $500,000 equity financing with a qualified institutional buyer  (\u201cQIB\u201d) in the form of restricted common stock and common stock  purchase warrants. The Company anticipates executing closing documents  this week, though there can be no assurances. Use of proceeds include  working capital and expenses to close announced and planned mergers and  acquisitions.\n\n5. As of May 4,  there have been approximately 75 people sign up for the Beta Test of  Kanab Club 2.0 with good feedback provided thus far.\ud83d\udcf7**1**\ud83d\udcf7**1**\n\nAnswers to shareholder questions:\n\n1. In  regard to the extension of the LOI to complete an acquisition of a  national HVAC contractor, we received this comment: \u201c. . .this is why  definitive agreements don\u2019t mean anything. . .\u201d\n\n*Definitive agreements are binding. We simply extended the LOI, which is non-binding, to allow more time for negotiations.*\n\n2.  \u201cLooking at FOMO online one gets the sense that maybe people are afraid  that the inability to get the name/ticker change to go through could be  a sign of a major issue\u2026 and we investors have no idea what the reason  is blocking the approval of the application to make the change. I know  if I were just coming into this today and took a look at everything that  has been said and done in the last \\~6 months I would be very hesitant  to jump in because my number one question would be \"Why can't this one,  seemingly simple goal, be accomplished?\u201d\n\n*This  has been my highest priority for the past several months. I can assure  everyone, without going into the details, it was very challenging.  Persistence is often the most important factor for success, and the  name/ticker change process has now been completed, pending final  confirmation from FINRA (see May 5 update above). I would like to  especially thank our legal team and the person at FINRA who recently was  assigned our file for doing a great job.*\n\n3. How many active clients do our partners currently have? (clients where the income directly affects FOMO Corp).\n\n*We can only announce contracts and/or sales after they have been completed. We will continue to do that.*\n\n4. How many new active clients do our partners have since we partnered with or acquired them?\n\n*Same response as above in #3.*\n\n5.  What is the current monthly increase in clients and installations, and  how much do you expect that to grow? What's the average value of one of  these clients to FOMO CORP.?\n\n*We  will provide pro forma financial projections for FOMO CORP. taking into  account companies we are acquiring when the acquisitions have been  completed (closed).*\n\n6. What  sort of additional investor outreach programs are you planning?  D!s cord  does not seem to be successful and may even be discouraging to a new  investor trying to get info about FOMO CORP.\n\nD!s cord *has been a new experience for all of us. We believe, on balance, it has  been a benefit to FOMO CORP. and its shareholders. We try to be as  transparent as possible, but sometimes there are investors who try to  take of the information we provide and manipulate the stock. We are  always looking for ways to improve* D!s cord*, and we value shareholder  suggestions. I would like to thank FOMO SOCIAL and the* D!s cord *moderators for their tireless, unsung efforts, in dealing with very  challenging situations at times.*\n\n7. Did we see any increase in interest based on the published article?  Are there any other articles, podcasts, etc. planned?\n\n*7.1  Public Relations through media publishers is typically a foundation for  sales, and it succeeds for business development when it is leveraged  with ongoing sales and additional publishings. While Purge Virus (PV)  and the Energy Intelligence Center (EIC) did not receive any immediate  inquiries from the Cover Story on the Mann Report, we are \"mining\" the  opportunity as follows:  A) We created a master Excel file that includes  all of the names of the real estate professionals referenced in the  article and then did the research to find their contact information. B)  We did the same for all of the other articles in the 130-page magazine  that was the April 2021 Sustainability Issue C) We have started calling  and emailing the prospective customers to let them know that we were  pleased to see them referenced in the same issue where we were the cover  story and invite them to learn more (via calls or Zoom) about our  offerings for safe and efficient buildings.*\n\n*7.2  The editorial team at Manufacturing Technology Insights magazine is  scheduled to publish the Cover Story on EIC over the next two weeks for  their May issue. This is a four-page spread with the cover and reaches a  combined print and online subscription base of over 150,000 executives  and facility managers, with approximately two per company. We expect the  exposure to over 70,000 companies to build on the Mann Report story and  generate customer interest in Energy Intelligence Center as well as  Purge Virus and Independence LED Lighting.*\n\n*7.3  The editorial team at Properties magazine is scheduled to include an  Op-Ed by Purge Virus/EIC CEO Charlie Szoradi over the next two weeks for  their May issue. This exposure is to about 30,000 subscribers that are a  combination of property owners and facility managers as well as  architects and engineers.*\n\n*7.4  One additional item of interest: In the sales outreach to schools,  Independence LED Lighting (ILED) just reported today that they received  the check from the Laboratory School of Communication and Languages. The  school is based in Philadelphia and has engaged ILED for energy  efficient perimeter lighting that is brighter than what they currently  have to enhance security. While the account is relatively small at  $14,000, it is an example of the FOMO \"ecosystem\" at work for safe and  efficient buildings. In some cases, sales outreach from Purge Virus or  the Energy Intelligence Center leads to cross-selling lighting  technology. Each account also has the potential for ongoing sales, and  the \"seed\" of the first contract sets the foundation for a business  relationship with other technology solutions. Since school  administrators often share resources and vendors, our hope is that this  account leads to contracts with other schools in the Philadelphia area  and beyond.*\n\n8. What kind of marketing is FOMO engaged in or do you plan on any additional marketing?\n\n*8.1  We will post the content on our respective websites and celebrate the  \"triple play\" of the publishing exposure in the Mann Report,  Manufacturing Technology Times, and Properties magazine via social media  and sales outreach to convert exposure into new client projects.*\n\n*8.2  This week, we have just signed up with a new email marketing group  Active Campaign to streamline outreach.  We have extensive data and  mailing contacts from over three decades of work by Charlie Szoradi and  other team members. The lists include over 40,000 architects and over  80,000 U.S. government procurement officers, as well as niche groups in  Education, Grocery Stores, etc. The government lists that are broken out  by Agency may be more valuable now than ever given President Biden's  focus on sustainability relative to the expected upcoming American Jobs  Plan and the American Families Plan from his State of the Union speech  last Wednesday. The Jobs/Infrastructure plan calls for upgrades to  buildings as well as roads and bridges and the Families plan calls for  improved schools, which we expect may include lower operating costs via  energy efficiency and safer air via disinfection. See the breakdown  here: Source:* [*https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/upshot/biden-families-plan-american-rescue-infrastructure.html*](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/upshot/biden-families-plan-american-rescue-infrastructure.html)\n\n*8.3  We paid to subscribe to a powerful data resource that identifies  details on spending by government agencies and public schools. GovSpend  allows us to see which group is buying what type of products such as Air  Purifiers, Building Management Systems, LED lighting, and much more.  This helps us identify the ABCs - Active Buying Customers, so that we  can tailor marketing and sales messages to them accordingly. 8.4 We have  an ongoing Webinar program as part of our marketing efforts to inform  prospective customers about our technology offerings to provide safe and  efficient buildings. Examples to date are here:* [*https://purgevirus.com/disinfection-webinar/*](https://purgevirus.com/disinfection-webinar/)\n\n9.  What is the expected revenue from the Kanab Club, and what is the  yearly budget. How do you plan to market that and attract users? How is  it different than other social platforms?\n\n*Kanab  Club is currently in the Beta Test phase. It is too early to provide  pro forma revenue projections. When Kanab Club 2.0 is officially  launched, it will focus on Health and Wellness. We intend to grow a user  base through that effort and then develop an e-commerce portal for  cannabis products and add other features in the future. We have an  excellent development team working on Kanab Club with functionality that  is Facebook-like.*\n\n10. Did Vik dilute another 25M shares?\n\n*There was no dilution, just normal compensation for employees and contractors of a public company*.\n\n11. Why do the LOI's keep getting pushed back?\n\n*We have extended some LOIs to provide more time for negotiations, auditing and valuations to be completed, etc.*\n\n:::(END COPY/ PASTE):::\n\nSo  there you have it folks. Big things coming. We know that SmartGuard is  bringing in huge contracts and that closing is scheduled for this month.\n\nThen Ecolite, then the HVAC company. By the summer this should be a fully formed ecosystem as they like to put it.\n\nBig things.....",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it\u2019s justified, given their clickbait titles or \u201c5 can't miss stocks of the century\u201d or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,\n\n&gt;If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it\u2019s that Motley Fool is utter trash\n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool\u2019s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X\u2019ed the S&amp;P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.\n\nBasically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.\n\n**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&amp;P500 returns during the same period.\n\na. One-Quarter\n\nb. One Year\n\nc. Two Year\n\nd. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)\n\nAnother feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday\u2019s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).\n\n**Results:**\n\n**Performance of Motely Fool Premium Recommendations** \n\n|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|**SPY**|**Change over SPY**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|One Quarter|6%|3%|3%|\n|One Year|24%|11%|13%|\n|Two Year|67%|20%|47%|\n|Till Date|134%|71%|63%|\n\n As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool\u2019s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \\~2X and two-year returns were \\~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&amp;P benchmark. \n\n**Performance of Motely Fool Sell Recommendations** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|\n|:-|:-|\n|If you followed Fool's Sell Recommendations|134%|\n|If you did not follow Fool's Sell Recommendations|167%|\n\nBut it\u2019s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla\u2019s 2020 rally.\n\n**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**\n\nThe stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool\u2019s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.\n\nBut I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.\n\n&gt;We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&amp;P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&amp;P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it\u2019s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.\n\nWhatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to Motley Fools.*",

        "selftext": "Sorry mods, I made a mistake and provided a poor link to a youtube channel. Moreover, I added a Risk section as it was lacking before.\n\nToday, I will cover $ASTS, [AST Space Mobile](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf). The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space, they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms $1T in TAM.\n\n*Why should you care?*\n\nThe recent market hit to high growth/speculative plays has not spared ASTS. This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately $1.2B (cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at $1.4B).\n\nThe company represents the most asymmetric risk/reward play on the market right now. It will either 20x-100x or go bust. Let me explain if they get only 1% of their TAM, which is ~$10B then at a cheap (assuming about 80% net margin, thanks to their 90% EBITDA margin) P/E ratio of 12x ([telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)), it gives the company a $96B market capitalization, representing an 80x opportunity.\n\n*Alright\u2026 100x if everything goes well, right?*\n\nYes, let me tell you why I and many others (some incredible DD from other investors like u/apan-man) think that the company will succeed. Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC-like risk/reward exposure, I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC (desirability, feasibility, and viability).\n\n**Desirability**\n\n*Targeted Segment*\n\nTheir satellites will offer services to large telecom companies, which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers. Think of AST\u2019s satellites like 5G towers in space.\nOf the currently 5B existing end users, the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Rakuten, Telefonica, Ooredoo, Telstra, and others.\n\nTo put this a bit into perspective, the only other company really trying to achieve that is [Lynk](https://lynk.global/), but they have only $10M in funding compared to $464M for ASTS, and currently do not have any commercial agreements.\n\n*Customer Relationships &amp; Channels*\n\nAll the customer relationship services, as well as sales efforts, are done by the carriers. Basically, AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage. This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive.\n\n*Value Proposition*\n\nDesigned to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones.\nImagine watching hot tub streams on the plane.\n\n**Feasibility**\n\n*Key Partners*\n\nIn the value chain, AST designs, integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components.\nThey will use any available launch services such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, Ariane, etc. The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks. Moreover, the main reason why the space-based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever-decreasing launch costs ([price to send a kg of payload in space](https://www.futuretimeline.net/data-trends/images/rocket-launch-costs-trend.jpg)).\n\nRegarding financial and strategic partners, the company has received funding from Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12-month lock-up.\n\n*Key Activities*\n\nAST will design and integrate the satellites. The company\u2019s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry, they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model.\n\nOf course, their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023. Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements. To give you an idea, on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers.\n\nFuture agreements won\u2019t be mutually exclusive (like with Vodafone), so they can add as many carriers as they want.\n\n*Key Resources*\n\nTalent, technology, and funding.\n\nAbel Avellan is not much of a salesman, but he is a genius, he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work.\n\nAs mentioned previously, they managed to attract funding from Vodafone, American Tower, and Rakuten. Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST\u2019s technology and has concluded that it works.\n\nFor further funding, ASTS is participating in the [$9B 5G rural fund for America](http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&amp;f_number=SATPDR2020041300034). They currently have the support of 7 senators (bipartisan) and AT&amp;T. In my opinion, there is the potential for AST to get about $1B in non-dilutive funding from the government, which would significantly accelerate the company\u2019s plan for global coverage.\n\n**Viability**\n\n*Revenue Streams*\n\nRevenues come from an agreement with telecom providers, basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee. The end-user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites.\n\n*Cost Structure*\n\nBecause the satellites are in LEO orbit, they will need to be changed every 5-7 years. The company is working on a way to repair/extend the lifetime of existing satellites.\n\nNow let's talk about an important topic: Risk.\n\n**Risk**\n\n*Tech(nichal/nology) risks*\n\n* Launch delays for BW3 (final full-size prototype) might increase costs. especially as they are not the main ride on the launch vehicle. This is a risk in the short term as the launch is scheduled for Q4 2021.\n\n* Technology does not work. While I think this has been largely minimized after the successful launch of BW1, there are some smarter people that believe it is both effective and amazing.\n\n* The company does not get licenses to operate the frequencies in target countries. Abel and the Board of Directors are very well connected and they have the support of huge telecom companies like Vodafone.\n\n*Commercial risks*\n\n* End-users do not see value in extended coverage from their current carriers. Difficult to see why that would be the case.\n\n* Telecom companies do not see value in AST's offering. AST Space Mobile has already a lot of agreements in place that suggests otherwise.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, technical and technological risks are quite high and are the big reason why the stock has not priced in the potential upside. The company could literally go to 0 (or close to it if they can sell some of their techs/patents/etc.). However, I believe the company offers a unique risk/reward ratio that is difficult to find on the market.\n\n**The long-term play**\n\nShares, shares, shares.\n\n**The short-term play**\n\nThe stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the stock has a relatively small float and could be very explosive on any news, such as new carrier agreements, analyst coverage, etc.\nAbel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers\u2019 agreement and the silent period ends this Friday.\n\nTL;DR $ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right, either 100x or 0x in a few years\n\nDisclosure: 35,000 shares\n\nEdit: While we may see movement on catalysts after the silent period ends, this is mainly a long-term (2-3 years) investment into a very asymmetric opportunity.\n\nEdit2: Thanks for all the feedback so far. I added a Risk section.",

I have a pretty heavy position in this company right now and I would love to argue if anyone has a bear thesis.\n\nThis stock has gotten severely beat down in the past few months due to the Alibaba's regulations and investigation.\n\n1. JD logistics IPO announcement is going to coming in the next few weeks. \n\n\n\n2. The Chinese government should finish their regulation review on JD in the next few weeks, which would clear any uncertainty on the company. This would easily cause a 10% rally in 1 day.\n\n\n\n3. The company's book value is $120/share. So there is 30-40% upside based solely on fundamentals. Politics aside.\n\n\n\n4. Earnings are coming up for this stock near mid-end of May. Should expect a reversal by then.\n\n\n\n5. Options IV is a complete joke right now and a great opportunity to get in.\n\n\n\n6. Cathie Wood has been adding to her JD position for the last week. She is pretty heavy in this company. She carries it in multiple of her ETFs with a significant holding.\n\nMy positions:\n\n100 shares\n\n7x Jan 2022 70c\n\n6x June 90c\n\n2x Sept 82.5c",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/palantir-hires-former-ibm-watson-health-exec.html\n\nPalantir has hired its first U.S. government chief medical officer, a former executive from IBM's Watson Health business, as the data analytics company doubles down on its life sciences business.\n\nWhile the company made its name in software used by government defense agencies, sales to health-related agencies in the federal government have doubled over the last year.\n\nThe company announced Monday its has hired former IBM Watson Health Deputy Chief Health Officer Bill Kassler to lead public health and life sciences teams across Palantir's domestic and global businesses.\n\nKassler said in an exclusive interview with CNBC that he would bring his expertise in clinical care and public health to the role, helping to connect the software to researchers who could benefit from it.\n\n\"Palantir is just an exciting group of young, talented engineers and data scientists and real, real intelligent, smart people,\" he said. \"But in order to deploy technology, you have to understand the theory and the logic and the practice of healthcare and public health. And I think we see a lot of technology companies that want to get into health but don't know that, make mistakes because they're not intimately familiar. And what I can bring to Palantir is my expertise as a clinician, as a public health doc, as somebody who has been working in this field for years to help with the science and the strategy and the relationships.\"\n\nInvesting in tech for the next pandemic\n\nIn his new role, Kassler said, he wants to help put Palantir's technology in the hands of researchers who can use it to make smart decisions in the next pandemic.\n\nHe highlighted three areas that he believes can be improved with the help of tech solutions like Palantir's: patching supply chain issues, dealing with localized surges of cases, and tackling racial and ethnic disparities.\n\nPalantir's Foundry platform has played a significant role in the U.S. government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as private companies' handling of essential supply chains. Palantir's technology allows researchers to combine and overlay datasets in ways that can make supply chain weaknesses or outbreak hotspots more obvious, allowing them to act quickly on their findings.\n\nOn the government side, the National Institutes of Health has recently begun using Palantir's platform to combine datasets from 50 different academic groups that it funds in ways that would have been cumbersome without the software.\n\nPalantir's technology helps the groups share data in ways that protects patient identities but allows them to gain more insights by analyzing a much larger dataset than they would have access to in their individual group settings. Julie Bush, who leads Palantir's federal health care work, said the data is now being used to better understand how the Covid-19 has impacted people with different backgrounds and conditions.\n\nBush said that type of broad data-sharing was less common prior to the pandemic, but that she hopes it continues after.\n\n\"People love to hoard their data,\" she said. \"And the pandemic really forced people to come together and be willing to share information and sort of set the bureaucracy aside. And, of course subject to data use agreements and other things, what we really saw was incredible collaborations happening across the government.\"\n\nKassler said he wants to see the technology used for more everyday use cases, too. One example he gave is how the Centers for Disease Control has already used the technology to help narrow the possible sources of an outbreak linked to produce. Rather than recalling produce from a large region, Palantir can help the agency trace the supply chain and pinpoint a smaller target.\n\n\"We don't know what the next pandemic will be,\" Kassler said. \"So we have to be prepared. And in order to do that we have to have invested in the systems that are able to have that situational awareness and to be able to enable organizations to respond quickly.\"",

This is my 4th child and I\u2019m excited. I am extremely involved in my kids lives and I love and support them in every way. I also love my wife and we have a great marriage. I\u2019m also hard working and I\u2019ve always done my best to provide. \n\nI made a mistake. I have always been conservative with stocks and usually only shares but I felt so strongly about RKT I went all in on options. And TBH, their ER was incredible with huge year over year increases. The only \u201cbad\u201d if you even call it they was missing EPS by one cent and guidance was a bit conservative but they always blow away previous ER guidance so no big deal IMO.  \n\nYes, I talked up RKT in other posts and comments before. And yes, I recommended buying share vs calls because I realized I messed up when the price didn\u2019t go as I planned. But I bought the calls weeks ago so it was too late for me. I just wanted to advise others that shares would be the safer play. \n\nWhy did I go all in: I believed in my own DD as well as the DD of others I read. I also bought into to the hype of all the WSB posts of others thinking this whole sub Reddit was behind it and it would fly. Lesson learned \n\nFinally, thanks to the few folks who offered kind words. Now, I\u2019m laying in bed next to my wife who is asleep trying to figure out how to have this conversation tomorrow. I have to tell her and it\u2019s not gonna be easy that\u2019s for sure. Especially since she\u2019s 9 months pregnant. Goodnight",

        "selftext": "Hi there apes,\n\nSo since the wrong SI% of float report came out, lots and lots of calls have been bought (maybe too many?). Right now the SI% of the float is actually still very high around 41% according to S3Partners, equal to 44.7m shares shorted. This leads me to the next thing, the total OI for calls is 598,882. If all these were to be executed that's 59.8m shares. So 59.8 (call OI) + 44.7(shares shorted) = 104.5m shares. The public float is 109.8m shares. Vanguard holds 26.2m shares. If you add these 26.2m shares to the 104.5m shares that is a total of = 130.7m shares. 20m+ shares MORE than the public float? Even if Vanguard sold covered calls on all their shares that would leave us with only 5.5m shares not being sold CC's on (not very likely) So this means lots and lots of these calls are sold naked!\n\nFor a gamma squeeze to happen you would need lots of calls at different strike prices, which CLOV has! Actually, it's insane to me how this many May and total calls have been sold, with literally no shares to back them up. Options table of CLOV below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img gkfb1trg1gx61...*\n\nPicture down below of the Call OI.\n\n*Processing img 6doe5yjh1gx61...*\n\nTable of how all this is calculated\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4fqlrnj1gx61.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e8899a7a954c14a7b8f6c047de1a8aaadb5d233\n\nWhat could the catalyst start all this? Well ER is on the 17th of May, so before all the may call expire. Furthermore, the DOJ investigation (what actually caused CLOV to go down in the first place) is now over. No PR yet, so I assume they will bring this up on ER!\n\nOther than that, they have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive. On top of that Biden and democrats are looking to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.\n\nLet's get this rocket flying already! \ud83d\ude80\n\nPosition: 81x june $11 calls.",

        "selftext": "I know a lot of folks in this sub have been seeing a lot of red lately. A word of caution for those expecting it to turn around - don't expect it in the near-term. Even ignoring the news - Yellen's comments on interest rates today, for example - the big boys are likely to be defensively positioned for the next 3-6 months. \n\nTo grasp why, well, always look to the left - preferably far to the left - to gauge overall market conditions. Let's take a look at the log-scaled monthly charts (newer traders - this is a useful tip for gauging long-term trends - if a stock has been getting exponential gains, look at trends in log scale).  Virtually the entire market is looking over-stretched, and the small caps and tech plays are particularly overstretched right now. \n\n**Russell 2000 Monthly  (Highest volatility/risk)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/816d70hw45x61.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f85efd17688183633e7f6801cff41f5f9b23887\n\n**Nasdaq Monthly (Mid-high risk)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixbae25k55x61.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9f5f91187d77a48dda05b2ef1c00dc14c1bfbb3\n\n**S&amp;P 500 Monthly (mid-risk)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr92k6st55x61.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9618bc4194c5ac55dce9462a32ef63d3b276e7cc\n\n**Dow Jones Industrials (Mid risk)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y96n9ul965x61.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1042c50c409e04867103212f9020be7c63cf8abf\n\nThe key thing to keep in mind is how far price levels are from the overall long-term trend. That's going to be a good signal of the overall risk-on vs. risk-off appetite of the market, particularly over the next couple quarters. Right now we are shifting from risk-on to risk-off, and the shift is likely to continue for a little while. Overall, small-caps (and especially micro-caps) are a really bad place to be relative to other companies, and will likely continue to be so through at least the end of the summer (and I'd bet on mid-Q4). \n\nA little on fundamentals to think about too: \n\n1. We are moving from a very loose credit environment to a slightly tighter credit environment. That means micro-caps especially will be more incentivized to raise funds through equity offerings rather than taking on new debt. Which means toxic funder dilution, which is usually terrible for share prices in micro-caps. \n2. A lot of recovery plays are starting to look overbought as well, at least relative to how quickly things will open up internationally. I was bullish on airlines and hospitality, for instance, a few months ago, I'm a bit less so now. This may also be part of why the Dow looks more overstretched than the S&amp;P, and comparable to the Nasdaq, which is fairly unusual.\n\nSo, where to park your money? Right now, I'd recommend looking defensively:\n\n1. Metals/Mining stocks - both GDX and SLV are in the handles of long term cup-and-handle formations, so they should be safe bets for now. Mining also has a tendency to lag industrials because of lag times in profits/indicators - the industrial indicators spike, driving the metal prices up, which drives mining profits up, but also incentivizes more mining, which can trigger a correction. (For pennies, I like $FTSSF - First Cobalt, which is making a lot of technical progress and getting lots of strategic investment from US/Canada because of China's rare earth refining dominance)\n2. Utilities - boring, I know, but increased industrial/commercial output leads to increased energy consumption, which is what drives utilities profits. And the utilities market is still off of its peak. \n3. Latin America/Brazil - overall the market here is looking quite undervalued, and Brazil has a lot of mining (Vale is a big driver of the EWZ etf, for example) and food/bev exports, etc. Plus, Bolsonaro's slow response has led to excessive investor trepidation about Brazil, which makes it a rare undervalued sector. (**Note:** weirdly, India appears to be fully valued or overstretched, perhaps because of a more robust foreign aid response, but also probably because of broader MSCI-Asia funds flowing to China are also flowing to India, so Indian asset prices benefit because of China's apparently successful COVID containment).",

Now I'm not denying the success rates of these funds. I know that over the course of 10 or 20 years only a small percent beat the market. That does not in any way reflect how an individual could perform. Mutual funds with billions under management have so many things going against them that a retail trader doesn't. The first is a management fee. The manager will take somewhere in the ballpark of 1% which starts them off behind. Their career is directly tied to their performance and so there is an incredibly strong incentive to be conservative with any speculation. Due to the size of the funds they can't easily invest in small companies or more obscure opportunities. Also due to the size of the funds they raise the price as they buy and drive it down as they sell getting a worse price on both ends than a retail investor. Between these things I think a reasonable retail investor has a significant advantage over these funds and so I think making silly claims comparing the two's success rate is misleading.",

        "selftext": "The AutoMod decided this was a bad post for /r/personalfinance so I am here now.\n\nHello /r/investing I was wondering what I should do in regards to my Roth IRA, basically I am focused growth, with plans to retire at age 55-62 depending on how everything goes (IE I hit whatever number I feel is appropriate I am done). Currently I have about 9K in my Roth IRA, and 11K in my 401k,  with plans to move much of that 401k money into my Roth so it can be maxed out.\n\nMy main questions are what exactly should I read to have more confidence in what I am doing, what should I be investing in, and should I use their roboinvestor (Even with the fees).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy understanding of my options are:\n\n1. Switch to the Robo advisor, with its 0.35% fee, which seems beatable to me, but I and all of my family use Chase, so it would be convenient, and I do already kinda like YouInvest. I think vanguard is like 10% of this rate fwiw, so it seems suboptimal, although I am taking on a lot of risk managing things myself.\n2. Buy mutual funds via my Chase account, my understanding is that I will not be charged a fee whatsoever for these trades \\[Source: [https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/online-investing/pricing](https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/online-investing/pricing)\\] and this would only charge me whatever fee the mutual fund charges.\n   1. I would presumably go with something like  TTIIX, as that is what my job put my 401k into, although they also underperformed the SP500 by quite a bit. Their fee is  0.100% \\[Source: [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/ttiix/quote](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/ttiix/quote)\\]\n   2. I could also just buy VTSAX, that seems like a semi-reasonable plan.\n3. Continue my manual buying of stocks and mutual funds I like, regardless of how risky it seems.\n   1. This seems dangerous to me, my current intuition on stocks has me about at the following ratios.\n      1. 40% SPYG\n      2. 25% VTSAX and the Schwab equivalent (I was YouTube researching on separate days and both ended up suggested.\n      3. 15% ARKK\n      4. 15% Ford (Hey, I made 85%)\n      5. 5% AAPL\n\nBasically my concerns are the level of risk I am taking, and the amount that I will pay for expert advice on my little bit of money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.",

April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings. \n\nThe average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April.

The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call \u201cYahoo.\u201d Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd. \n\nChip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020\u2019s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. \n\nCisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could \u201c...\\[take\\] another six months\u2026\u201d for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. \n\nThe effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW\u2019s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, \u201c...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter\u2026\u201d So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.  \nGM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying \u201cIf you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors\u2026 these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...\u201d\n\nThe United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   \nMeanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang\u2019s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. \n\nThe increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company\u2019s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it\u2019s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. \n\nMicrosoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector. \n\n**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**\n\n**Monday, May 3rd:**  \nEstee Lauder  \nApollo Global Management Inc  \nCarvana  \nON Semiconductor Corp  \nThe Mosaic Company  \nChegg Inc.\n\n**Tuesday, April 27th:**  \nPfizer  \nT-Mobile  \nCVS  \nActivision Blizzard  \nConocoPhillips  \nSysco  \nZillow  \nXilinx  \nHelloFresh  \nUnder Armor  \nWestern Union  \nMcAfee  \n**Wednesday, April 28th:**  \nPaypal Inc.  \nUber  \nGeneral Motors  \nTwilio Inc  \nMetLife Inc  \nBudweiser Brewing Company  \nBarrick Gold Corp.  \nFranco-Nevada Corp  \nEtsy Inc  \nFox Corp  \nGoDaddy  \nZynga  \n**Thursday, April 29th:**  \nSquare  \nNintendo  \nModerna  \nMonster Beverage Corp  \nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals  \nRoku Inc  \nAIG  \nAllstate  \nWayfair Inc  \nCBS Corp  \nPeloton Interactive  \nCloudflare  \nExpedia  \nKellogg Co.  \nAlliant Energy Corp.   \nPenn National Gaming  \nNorwegian Cruise Line Ltd.  \nDropbox\n\n**Friday, April 30th:**  \nDraft Kings  \nNCsoft",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, this is my first serious DD here.\n\n1. Fundamentals\n\nBiontech has 238 Million Shares available. The price is around \\~190$ right now.\n\n Which means the market cap right now is 45Billion $\n\nOwnership:\n\n50% belong to Andreas and Thomas Str\u00fcngemann under AT Impf, they were early investors since 2008.\n\n22% is Inside-Ownership like the Owner Ugur Sahin who holds 16%\n\n11% is institutional ownership.\n\nSo 83% of the total float is pretty much locked up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue and Winnings. 10th of April is their next quarterly call.\n\nSo as many of you know Biontech produces the covid vaccine which Pfizer distributes in the US. Pfizer and Biontech share the winnings.\n\nIn 2021 Biontech will gross around 20 billion$ in Sales.  80% of that will be winnings.\n\nSo around 35% of the market cap right now are winnings of 2021.\n\nBut this isnt just it. \n\nBiontech is the first company who will get admission for people under the age of 16.\n\nBiontech is about to anounce a deal with China to sell them around 100M to 500M doses by july.\n\nThe vaccine will last around 6-9 months, then you will need another shot. Because antibodies will be too low. Biontech produces mRNA, which is far better than adona-shots like Johnson &amp; Johnson or Astra-Zeneca-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBiontech will be able to produce around 3 Billion doses a year. They can make around 10$ Profit for each dose. We dont know if we need another shot in 2023 and forward, but it seems possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this is just the beginning, the true reason of biontech was to find a cure with mRNA against cancer.\n\nNow they have around 10B $ in cash for research and 14 clinical trials running.\n\nYou wanna imagine how much money they will make with the cancer industry?\n\nAt least 10M people a year get diagnoses with cancer. \n\nThis is how much a cancer patient costs (a raw show from 2010)\n\n[https://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html](https://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html)\n\nLets just be very conservative and say they make 4000$ profit for every patient and have just 20% market share at 10M patients. That would be 8 billion a year of profits scaling up over time as the population gets older. \n\nAnd this is very conservative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus we dont know what else they can do with the mRNA technologie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if they find a cure against cancer with mRNA with 10B$ a year in profit, that should be worth 200B$ Market cap. Plus they will problably make 40-50B $ with covid vaccines. \n\nTheir longterm market cap should be around 200B$ -250B $ and this doesnt account their very good reputation and first mover advantage in a new powerful science technologie with lots of room for new discoveries.\n\nWhich should put their longterm stock price from 190$ current to around 1000$ by 2024-2025 at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I am buying shares since a long time plus buying longterm call options, which went up nicely already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking forward for feedback, thank you for your time\n\nTLDR BNTX, I like the stock\n\n\\*this is not financial advice, I am literally a retard\\*",

I\u2019m newer to options, although I\u2019ve been studying them for about two years now, have a decent understanding of the Greeks, and know the basics of what qualities to look for in underlying to maximize chances of a successful trade.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking of using about 60k from my brokerage to generate income selling cash secured puts. I\u2019ve done some math and figure I have a good shot to make 5-10% year by selling some conservative weekly puts (like .3 delta / 8-10% OOTM). For all the people that are more experienced than me, I\u2019m wondering if this is even worth it or if I should just stick it all in VOO/VTI, especially since I understand all premiums will be taxed as short term capital gains. Is it realistic to make more than 10% a year often by selling puts, or is that thinking too greedily?\n\nThanks - all advice welcome and appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Today APHA &amp; TLRY [announced](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilray-aphria-announce-closing-transaction-creates-new-tilray) that the merger is officially closed. Yay! Ok, but what does this mean for my stock??  \n\n\n**If you were a holder of APHA** shares as of 5/30/21 (Friday), each of your APHA shares will turn into 0.8381 shares of TLRY. This means that if you had 100 APHA shares, you will not have 838.1 shares of TLRY. **Keep in mind there are NO fractional shares.** This means that if your shares come out to 838.1, you will only receive 838 shares of TLRY. That number is always rounded DOWN, not up and there will be NO CASH to compensate you for your fractional share (so you can lose at most 0.99 shares of TLRY depending on how much APHA you have - which is like \\~$18.56 (if TLRY is at $18.75))  \n\n\n**If you were a holder of TLRY shares** you are STILL a holder of TLRY shares. Nothing changes for you. In the announcement, the company mentions the TSX listing, but this is a [DUAL LISTING](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duallisting.asp). TLRY will continue to trade on NASDAQ. TLRY will ALSO trade under the symbol \"TLRY\" on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) starting May 5th. Really nothing for you to do here, just gives you the ability to trade them on either exchange - it provides extra liquidity.  \n\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the \"back office\" - this happens at big banks and at big hedge funds too. APHA has HALTED today and will no longer trade. TECHNICALLY you now own TLRY shares that were given to you in the merger. When those show up in your account and you have the ability to freely trade those depends on what broker you use. If you're worried about it - call them. If you want to buy TLRY today, you can. Just go buy more and then the APHA shares that converted to TLRY will be added to your position when everything settles with your broker.",

        "selftext": "What's up retards? I'm going to try to make this brief, but concise because why use many word when few word good enough. I might be retarded, but I'm pretty sure today is going to mark the first day of a short squeeze with Corsair and unlike a lot of the other shitty \"short squeeze incoming... hopefully\" (looking at you CLOV) posts on WSB this one is going to happen (is happening) whether you Apes are in or not. I'm only here because I made a fuckton of money on GME earlier this year and I want to give something back to the community.\n\nHere's the rub:\n\nCorsair is a premier PC accessories company that's been around for a couple decades, but just went public towards the end of last year. Since then they have \\[KILLED their earnings\\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/analysis?p=CRSR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/analysis?p=CRSR)) EVERY. SINGLE. QUARTER. coming in an average of 60% above the analyst expectations and yet somehow there's 20% short interest on the stock. At first they weren't issuing guidance because pandemic, but yesterday before the bell they reported earnings that were 75.80% above expectations AND RAISED GUIDANCE for 2021 from \\~$1.875bil to \\~$2bil and yet somehow the stock dropped from $35 premarket to $31.50 at the low of the day because the market is too busy trying to squeeze imaginary currencies recommended by the meme's of eccentric billionaires right now I guess. This is especially moronic because the fundamentals are so incredibly good for this company. As it currently stands market cap is roughly $3 billion, with expected revenue of $2 billion for the year and EBITDA earnings around $250 million. In other words, CRSR has a forward P/E of about 12 right now and Price to Sales of 1.5x, low enough to make a value company blush, and yet this is a rocket fueled growth company in a rapidly expanding growth sector with 20% short interest.\n\nDigging a little deeper:\n\nNot only did the price swing 10% from high to low yesterday, but it was a high volume day for CRSR in general and for some reason the shares short made up \\[73% of the volume for the day\\]([https://shortvolume.com/?t=crsr](https://shortvolume.com/?t=crsr)). That's right, the shorts really thought shorting another 1 million shares was the right thing to do after that rock star earnings report. This is truly, catastrophically retarded. Today the stock has been up as high as $36.11 and has been holding steady above $35. If we check how many short shares are available on iborrowdesk it looks like the shorts \\[haven't even started covering today\\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRSR](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRSR)) from their short positions that were created yesterday AND there are only about 350k short shares available to borrow right now meaning the shorts have very little ammo to try to push the stock down or hunt for stop losses. Those million short shares from yesterday are all currently under water and when they start to cover this is going to push up even higher which will trigger the rest of the 20% of the short interest to consider covering their positions and get out now. There's a word for this kind of chain reaction, what is it..? Oh yeah, SHORT. SQUEEZE.\n\nWhen do we get to Mars?\n\nLike I said, I'm not here to bullshit you, I truly want to see my fellow apes get some tendies. That said, we're probably not going all the way to Mars. This isn't another GME. But, the moon is within our ape-like grasp. This could easily touch $50 by the end of this year and hit $70+ next year. This isn't just a short squeeze play, this is a long term value play (Logitech, Corsairs major competitor, trades at a 20.5 P/E, so if all we did was reach their P/E with no more earnings growth (ha) we would be at about $55 per share). If you buy now YOU WILL MAKE MONEY. Buy and hold or get some options that will expire in a couple months (squeezes can take a while to play out) and wait, then dump them when you get a 100%+ bagger and post your gain porn. LET'S FUCKING GO!!!\n\nTL;DR: Buy Corsair, get tendies\n\nPositions: 23,000 shares, 250 June $35 calls\n\nObligatory rockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIf you think I'm a financial advisor then you're really fucking retarded.",

Sony makes &amp; sells games direct to consumers, without relying on a middle man (like Apple). Sony makes &amp; sells the most sought after gaming machine - demand will likely exceed supply all year (at least). They're also into VR (and make &amp; supply the small OLED displays that power VR headsets &amp; viewfinders).  \n\nSony has a well established music &amp; movie studios.  They  recently signed large streaming deals with Netflix and Disney.\n\nSony is also the top producer of image sensors - from mobile phones (iPhone) to high end cameras (they also produce their own line of stills &amp; cinema cameras and lenses) to industrial sensors for cars &amp; other machinery (ahem MVIS).\n\nIn addition to car sensors, they are now road testing their own EV - way ahead of Apple and many of the recent TSLA-wannabe startups.  They are a key supplier for other companies (Apple, Nikon, Panasonic, et al.) and they use their parts for their own products (the competition helps to subsidize their own products like Samsung).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STATS &amp; PEERS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SONY**\n\n2020 Revenue $75.4B\n\nCap $126B\n\nP/E 11.8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AAPL**\n\n2020 Revenue $274B\n\nCap $2.2T\n\nP/E 29.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SAMSUNG**\n\n2020 Revenue $212B\n\nCap $493\n\nP/E 21.2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MSFT** \n\n2020 Revenue $143\n\nCap $1.9T\n\nP/E 34.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NINTENDO** \n\n2020 Revenue $12B\n\nCap $69.5B\n\nP/E 17\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TSLA** \n\n2020 Revenue $31.5B\n\nCap $683.4B\n\nP/E 710\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CANON**\n\n2020 Revenue $29.7B\n\nCap $24.9B\n\nP/E 24.7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notable Products**\n\n[Sony Semi](https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/e/)\n\n[Sony Car](https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/vision-s/)\n\n[Sony Cameras](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-camera-products/t/interchangeable-lens-cameras)\n\n[Sony Content](https://www.sonypictures.com/)\n\n[PS5](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR**\n\n$SONY - Sony Corp \ud83d\ude80\n\nSony is well-diversified, their product pipeline is promising, imaging &amp; semi continue to grow and they are undervalued compared to many of their peers.\n\n*I'm not an investment professional, this is not financial advice.

        "selftext": "Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.\n\nInvesting in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.\n\nI\u2019ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel\u2019s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.\n\n*The Fab Ahab:*\n\nAhab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel\u2019s worst king.\n\nIntel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel\u2019s giant shadow. Intel\u2019s story \u2013 to me \u2013 looks like a downfall story in the making.\n\nIntel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel\u2019s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.\n\n*Hail Mary:*\n\nI call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.\n\nAt roughly the same time as Intel\u2019s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel\u2019s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision \u2013 a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.\n\n*Intel\u2019s Fab Focus In Question:*\n\nIntel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China\u2019s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.\n\nIn any case, I don\u2019t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.\n\nAnd if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.\n\nOverall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I\u2019ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",

Michael Burry has been warning us about a possible hyperinflation, all this will be **explained LATER ON!!**\n\nI'm going to break down each one of Kenny strategies as we go in the post.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TRUST BONDS: The basket of bonds INFITINE MONEY GLITCH!!!**\n\nFirst of all let me stress how important this is!\n\n**THIS IS KENNY MAIN SOURCE OF CASH (LIQUIDITY)**, with this he's able to do all kinds of fuckery from shorting, to all the washing methods above (Ill explain more with sources as we move forward).\n\nThey love shorting because they love producing naked shares to fill up the juicy [**TRUST BONDS**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateraltrustbond.asp#:~:text=A%20collateral%20trust%20bond%20is,pay%20the%20bondholder%2C%20if%20necessary) and get more and more cash for liquidity and fukery!!\n\nSo what's inside those **TRUST BONDS?**\n\n\"A collateral trust bond is a bond that is secured by a financial asset such as stock or other bonds\"\n\nWAIT WHAT???\n\nSo you telling me that Kenny is not only able to put his NAKED SHARES inside this basket called **TRUST BONDS** and pack it to sell, but that he can **PUT TRUST BONDS INSIDE OTHER TRUST BONDS?**\n\nThis is the pyramid and biggest **PONZI SCHEME!!!!**\n\nHear me out:\n\nThey have been **shorting many businesses** and also **buying some long positions in many other** businesses (I read somewhere and I cant find the source that Citadel controls 26% (according to the senate in the hearing) of the market). Thank you for the comment u/citadelsecuritiesLLC\n\nSo this means that they can **grab a basket** (TRUST BOND) and **filling it up with half \"good solid long positions\"**(lets say aple, tesla, amazon) and **half GME naked made up shares!!, close the basket and sell it!. Thats a 50% Good old TRUST BOND from citadel.**\n\n**HOLY ACTUAL FU%\\^CK!! Are you serious??**\n\nGets worse!!\n\nSo you telling me that you can **fill bonds with other bonds?** That's tranching and creating the pyramid of shit underneath!\n\n**THIS IS THE BIG SHORT ALL OVER AGAIN!!**\n\nThe first baskets full with the Good nice long positions and real shorts go first! like the AAA in the movie?\n\nThe **last baskets are going be filled with not only GME naked shorts**, but with a **MIX OF ALL THE OTHER COMPANIES THEY ARE SHORTING INCLUDING TESLA, AMAZON** and you name **to give them a better rating and price, BUT THEY ARE COMPLETELY FULL OF NOTHING INSIDE!!** those ones are the equivalent of the BBB LIKE IN THE BIG SHORT!!!\n\nCome on! is this **HAPPENING AGAIN**, are you serious?????\n\n**WHEN IS THIS PEOPLE GOING TO LEARN???**\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now... The biggest banks are holdings! (READ BELLOW ABOUT IT)**\n\n**Kenny and kids (Melvin, Susquehanna and other baby hedge funds) have been shorting over and over to own companies debt to hold leverage against the banks for daddy Kenny as well!**\n\nSo... **While the company is not yet bankrupt \u2026.** [Shitadel MM makes trust bonds](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-12-08-0612080128-story.html)**, pack them with all the fake GME naked shares inside (can be mixed with other company shorts or full GME) and** [sell them as if they were full of valuable real GME](https://www.wiredupreport.com/2021/03/16/viral/citadel-issued-600m-worth-of-bbb-rated-bonds/) **(the system don\u2019t recognize fakes from reals, right?)** Getting tons of money!\n\n**That's a big part of how he gets his Liquidity!!**\n\nHis process is extremely complex, he uses algorithms to move the money constantly and very fast, trenching those bonds inside others and reposition them to hide all the rubbish undetected, also buying T-bonds, mortgages, short more companies and etc.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nAlso, like the [SEC document](https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/) states, Kenny and other banks are funding other business in many other countries giving them money and taking advantage (we know how).\n\nWhen those business bankrupt too! Archegos style!!, they go and buy the real state overseas dirt cheap!) They love making naked shares because that\u2019s how they get liquidity out of those useless juicy trust bonds.\n\nExplained better in the KENNY SCAMMING AROUND THE WORLD in PART 2\n\n**So the money come from none existent trash and then make a shit ton more moving it?** Holy Balls!\n\n**The ones who buy those Shitadel trust bonds are the bagholders!! They are buying bonds that are full of shit!!**\n\nHe is successfully draining the money from the company, from the retail shareholder and for all the people that bought those trust bonds!! While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!! THIS NEEDS TRACTION SO EVERY APE SEES IT!**\n\n**SHARE IT WITH OTHER APES IN OTHER POSTS AND COMMENTS!! ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE LOUD!**\n\nI RUN OUT OF CHARACTERS!!!

        "selftext": " \n\n**Dream Office REIT Updates**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) 366 Bay Street Toronto - Recently Fully Leased**  \n\n\n  \nDream appears to have full leased 366 Bay Street. In Q4, this location was only 34% Lease due to renovations. Around 30,000 square feet was available in Q1, and the building is now showing fully leased  \n[https://leasing.dream.ca/building/366-bay-street?search=](https://leasing.dream.ca/building/366-bay-street?search=)  \n\n\n  \n366 Bay Street was recently renovated and prepped for new tenants, and should have been leased around $45/foot. The $45 / foot rate is based on the newly renovated 357 Bay Street location which was leased in Q4 at $45 / foot.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**2) 2200 Eglinton Redevelopment**  \n\n\n  \n2200 Eglinton continues to be negotiated with the city. There are still a lot of changes to be made to their redevelopment proposals, but it will get approved. The golden mile is going through major growth and redevelopment by multiple major land owners, including Dream, SmartCentres, RioCan, and Choice Properties.  \n\n\n  \nOnce approved, the proposal will add around 2.5 Million in density. That works out to about $175M, or $4/unit NAV to Dream Office valuation. This is anticipated in Q4 2021 if all goes to plan.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n**3) Dream Industrial REIT holdings by Dream Office REIT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of Q4 2020, Dream Office holdings of Dream Industrial was valued at $13.15/unit. At the end of Q1 2021, it was $13.42/unit. An increase of around 2%. This is around 10 cents a unit in NAV increase for Dream Units. \n\n  \nThe holdings by Dream office of Dream Industrial is around 1/3rd of Dream's total market cap today, or around $350,000,000. These holdings can be borrowed against, or sold. \n\n  \nWhen you consider Dream Office is trading at a Market Cap of around $1,070,000,000 yet $350,000,000 of value is Dream Industrial Units,  $175,000,000 will be recognized soon on Eglinton, and $245,000,000 of properties are unencumbered, it's pretty easy to see the mispricing of Dream Office.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**4) Buybacks Coming**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Dream's Q4 Earnings Call, Michael Cooper was adamant on buybacks.  \n\"So I would say that the NCIB, we'll get a new one on mid-August. And I would expect on we see now, if the stock is where it is, we'll use it all up.\"  \n\"Over the next few years, we do not have a lot of capital commitments, so our balance sheet remains flexible.\"  \n\"So I think we'll continue to buy back stock as much as we can. I mean one of these is, we had 114 million shares at the peak. Now we're about 54 million. So we've reduced them by more than 50 million shares.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMichael Cooper has made it clear, buybacks will begin mid August (NCIB can be renewed then, last one was used up). These buybacks are likely to be 10% of the units outstanding. As I have mentioned before in other posts, the total float not held by insiders and institutions is only around 20-25 Million. Possibly less. Buying back 5 Million units is substantial, and will leave very few units trading publicly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**5) Office Market Update**  \n\n\n  \nAllied Properties released their results last week. Some highlights from their Earnings Call:\n\n  \n\" In Toronto, we maintained our leased area at 95.8%\"  \n\"We have remained unconcerned by the amount of space available for sublease in our portfolio.\"  - Sublet Space has declined from 6% to 5.3% (Dream Office has less than 2% sublet available for lease, which is extremely low)  \n\"The team recently tallied the amount of space currently under discussion in our portfolio, not including renewals at just over one million square feet... While we will not complete all of the potential deals, we are very encouraged for future results on the level of activity today.\"  \n\n\n  \nAllied has posted a very solid quarter during Q1, even as lockdowns rocked the headlines, and businesses remained forced closed.  \n\n\n  \nThe VODI index is showing a rebound in various markets. As we exit out of COVID, and vaccinations ramp up, the reopening will drive businesses to reopen their offices, and as proven in the USA markets, office demand will pickup as pent up demand begins the recovery.  \n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210428005266/en/National-Return-to-Work-Imminent-as-Employers-Ramp-up-Efforts-to-Find-Office-Space](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210428005266/en/National-Return-to-Work-Imminent-as-Employers-Ramp-up-Efforts-to-Find-Office-Space)  \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------  \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n  \nIn conclusion, the pandemic created a buying opportunity, and quality office REITs are showing some rebounding strength in their operations. It is my belief that REITs located in high demand areas, and that are still on sale, will show one of the strongest rebounds in the REIT sector for the remainder of the year. Sticking to REITs with quality assets, in core markets, will provide the greatest amount of safety as an investment. Dream Office's low debt, high liquidity, and over 85% of their assets in Downtown Toronto, will be one of the great winners of 2021. The catalyst for Dream is anticipated to be the August Buybacks. However, other speculation regarding a potential move by Sandpiper/Artis may occur. But that is simply speculation at this point. \n\n  \nH&amp;R REIT is another REIT I believe will continue its upward trend. H&amp;R's assets are 39% Office Weighted. Of that, H&amp;R's office portfolio is basically 100% leased (99.6%), a 12 year average lease term, and over 85% of their office tenants are investment grade credit rated tenants. One of the most defensive office portfolio's in North America. The catalyst for H&amp;R is expected to be their Spin Off of their divisions into multiple new REITs. One for each asset class. The announcement is anticipated in about 2 weeks, during their Q1 earnings report.  \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------\n\n  \n**Additional information/Facts:**  \n\n\n  \n\\- Downtown Toronto is 85% of all of Dream's Assets. Those assets can be walked, in a 1 hour walking tour. These assets are highly desired, and extremely difficult to aquire.  \n\\- NAV is expected to continue to rise as in place rents in the low 20s are replaced with market rents $40-50. This is significant organic growth that will drive Dream's NAV over the next 5 years with minimal capital expenditures.  \n\\- New buildings require around $80/foot leases to be worth investment for building. As older buildings in Toronto are removed in favor of new developments, this leaves less competition in Dream's renovated $40-$50/foot offerings.  \n\\- Dream has been reconfiguring their buildings to be single floor space offerings around 5,000-10,000 square feet. This allows businesses to rent a full floor all to themselves. This is highly desired and commands higher rent per foot. This is also a fairly unique offering differentiating Dream's Collection from other buildings.  \n\\- Dream is one of, if not the largest building owner in the downtown financial district  \n\\- Significant developments are planned for the future which is expected to nearly double GLA, without needing to aquire more land. 2200 Eglinton (3 Million GLA), 212-220 King (1.1 Million GLA, 50% ownership), and 250 Dundass (500 Thousand GLA) are some major potential projects.  \n\\- Debt in Dream Office is conservatively at \\~40% debt to assets  \n\\- Michael Cooper has the majority of his personal holdings in Dream Office REIT.   \n\n\n\\--------------------  \n\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n  \nLike always, this is not investment advice. Always do your own due diligence. I have long positions in both D.UN and HR.UN. I make these posts as opportunities in some investments are under the radar, but provide great potential.

        "selftext": "Ok. I (and everyone here by now) knows that these are relatively small drops and understandable after such a historic bull market. But a lot of us just started investing in February after meme stocks got us interested. And a lot of people here and elsewhere said \"time in the market beats timing the market.\" So we, not knowing what we were doing, invested at the top. And now, when the market is going down, we're going red. Because, unlike many of you, we didn't get all the massive gains. So you're going from +50% to +40% and we're going -10% to -20%.\n\nI'm not trying to say we're blameless- I definitely put in too much money to start off with when I didn't know what I was doing \\[not even on memes, just bought high valuations\\]. Not trying to absolve responsibility here. But also, I do think the smug attitudes and \"wHaT ArE YoU GUyS InVEStEd In?!\" is a bit much. We get it. We made some mistakes. I, at least, even appreciate the warnings about planning how we'd feel if it drops a lot more and what we'll do.

Living there a tax free life I never invested in anything except buying a house for myself and spending the rest of the money lavishly. I never had any loans but because I had a good salary (I was a first officer in an airline) I could afford to do that. The first time I filed my tax returns ever in Canada 2 years back and after having a conversation with my accountant I realized I was doing it all wrong. I started reading and it got me genuinely interested in investing (stocks, crypto,forex everything). after reading about gamestop I made an account with redditt and this is one of the only two communities im part of and I love it.\n\nNow im 42 living in Toronto which  married with a baby. I discontinued my flying and bought a small convenience store which did well initially but is kinda shut due to the ongoing lockdown.

        "selftext": "TLDR: **Long July corn** (futures preferred) although any ETF with exposure to cash corn would be best. I'm sorry if you can't trade futures. The next contract in September would not be preferred since that's the start of the harvest which usually runs into November. \n\nIf you have been watching the news, expensive agriculture has been nothing new in the past month. That shouldn't be too worrying, since the May Corn which set a high at $7.40/bsh was due to lack of old-stored stock because no one planted that much or thought to store that much during the recession. This is kinda like the opposite of the negative oil prices last year when there was 0 demand and full storage, because right not there is quite brisk demand (not from food, but ethanol producers) and almost all empty grain stores. July corn should also face the exact same problem, possibly worse as fertilizer prices are climbing and a few other factors detailed below. \n\n**Ethanol Demand**: Who uses the most corn? Nope, not farmers for feed or your fat wife but ethanol producers. What happens to all that ethanol? Except for some good ol' states like Oklahoma which sells mostly 100% pure American anticommunist gasoline, the ethanol is used for fuel. A quick google search will yield [articles reporting that fuel demand for end of March has surpassed levels set during 2020](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-products-gasoline/u-s-gasoline-demand-exceeds-2020-levels-for-first-time-in-2021-opis-idUSKBN2BM1UR). Americans are driving/traveling again as more and more of us are getting vaccinated, simply don't care, or are forced to commute back to the office. This will result in continued high demand for gasoline, and thus ethanol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smk6hcb45zw61.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2f11d0df5ce0709bd39995039d06ec8a4e54e15\n\n**Lack of Supply**: This is the critical part that resulted in May Corn's sharp rise. Supply as of right now might not be getting better, and thus should also play into July Corn's pricing. These are largely weather based, but starting with...\n\n**Corn Stocks are still trending down**: If you've ever watched Trading Places and wondered if you can make a killing on the crop report, here's your chance. This is the March 2021 grains report, and the headline is that [Corn stocks are -3% from 2020](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/xg94hp534/db78v700p/7p88db273/grst0321.pdf). But this doesn't show the trend. Flip to page 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2020-2021](https://preview.redd.it/bsx7kvo07zw61.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac918dfe02b84bf46afcbaedff22008d2ceeae1)\n\nEssentially all the 2020 harvest should be accounted for in December 2020 (harvest for corn is usually Sept - Nov). The demand is almost 250 million bushels more than the similar timeframe from last year. Also remember when looking at the March 2020 data below, that is when gasoline demand and food demand dropped through the floor. We're not going to get any new corn until September, so this summer of relying on what we have still in storage is going to get tight. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whrhpl4e8zw61.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1c85216ec9a6834a0cf5fb211fc897714b8656b\n\n**Weather pt1 Droughts**: Even though weather this summer won't affect July corn which should already be in storage, inclement weather might force users to bring forward their deliveries, because they won't be sure if their September/December stocks will even be there. Right now, the midwest is starting to see[signs of a drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) (if you're going to trade this, this site has to become your new bookmarked page). A look at the historical patterns, and you can see more and more of the midwest is [facing inclement drought conditions](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?Midwest). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/681ap0bg9zw61.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a320d905223497a3108bf3d1081946112adf5c70\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4qqafns9zw61.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=965ce52f6b5c8fc429e47142af571f12d42b3923\n\n**Weather pt2 Odd Weather Patterns**: Now I haven't read any scholarly articles for this, but doesn't it seem weather is odd this year for most of the country? First the [big winds from last year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2020_Midwest_derecho), then the early 2021 [big polar vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2021_North_American_cold_wave) that made a big V shape, and then sudden warming we're seeing now. I won't be so shocked if some big storm happens this summer to affect the heartland. Corn is very susceptible to storms because the roots are really shallow. \n\n**Weather pt3 Stress**: In any case, the weather so far might be leading to stressed corn. I have some BS11 planted in the middle of Texas, and it's already tasseling without any ears. This may be due to heat and drought conditions, but in any case I've heard farmers' horror stories of having their entire acreage sold for sileage because not one ear grew. Here's a pic of mine. The corn is about 4ft tall right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9sgyn7bbzw61.jpg?width=2976&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=476caf52a3d8542e8e2048d5e456102d12f9a80d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**High input costs**: This shouldn't color you shocked, but there's a [fertilizer shortage](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/fertilizer-shortage-ken-ferrie-weighs-fertilizer-issues-spring) going on too. You gotta use that and pesticides. I'm not sure if farmers have calculated this, but there's about at 20% increase in prices. Naturally I hope this means they're not willing to hedge their prices at a lower level (selling into the market), further helping prices go higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other considerations**: Corn is an international crop, but most of it is in the US. Brazil and Ukraine should have good planting, but once again that shouldn't affect July because of the supply/demand imbalance. There's also something about a locust infestation in Indiana. But, [plantings are increasing at a brisk pace](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/corn-planting-progress-leaps-29-points-beats-2020s-historic-jump). That might be why prices dropped today which I bought into. \n\nThese are my positions. I look forward to keep buying 2-5 contracts at a time and holding towards expiration in 57 days. \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6cp4h3ybzw61.jpg?width=719&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1c4e2054c36a9b4c1b0a7a2f10cbe5f96ed411c",

        "selftext": "I read today that if a stock is trading at 20.04 and pays a .4 dividend, on ex-dividend day the stock will adjust down to 20.00 to reflect that dividend no longer being available to buyers. \n\nI got down voted to hell for saying it's not necessarily 1:1 like that, but actually now I'm just confused.  Is it actually 1:1 like that?  Does the stock price adjust down automatically by that exact amount? I was under the impression that prices were only affected by supply and demand.  What about open limit orders?  Do they automatically adjust down by that exact that moment? I saw this somewhere. \n\nOr is it 100% due to market forces?  Since investors know they are no longer entitled to that money on ex-dividend day, they will naturally be willing to pay .4 less for the stock, thus they adjust their bid sizes accordingly. \n\nThe info I'm finding online is not clear on it.  Some sources are saying it's automatic, some are saying it's market forces (or maybe I'm just being thick)  Anyway, sorry for spreading misinformation in the other thread, but it would be cool if someone could actually clarify how this works.",

        "selftext": "The recent run up in equities has people questioning if they missed the top, if they are too late and if this was already the end of a young bull market in uranium. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, as a long term price per pound of uranium is still in need of between 50 and 60 dollars. If it doesn\u2019t reach this target within the next three years, we are in for much bigger issues and this will not be allowed to happen in my view. As part of the research document I wrote on uranium investing, I constructed a phase model that walks us through every part of what I think will be a generational bull market. We are very much still in phase 2 of my 6 phase model, but with phase 3 slowly emerging on the horizon. What are these 6 phases you might think? They can be categorized as follows in a stadium like model:\n\nPhase 1, constructing the stadium (2016-2020):\n\n\\- The early/smart money, the first time we come out of a prolonged bear market. Equities may not have really moved yet, but it is finally starting to look brighter. After the price of uranium bottomed several years ago, it has crept up slowly but surely, but without proper reaction of the underlying equities. Catalysts are building and around the end of this phase (between July and October of last year) is when I first started sharing my due diligence on here. This phase ended at the start of the first big run up we have seen.\n\nPhase 2, getting on the bus (2020-2021):\n\n\\- Once share prices finally move (as we have seen between November and February of this year), it is time for more of the smart money to come in. Those who see that we have finally come out of a bear market and that the busses are slowly being loaded. Price movement will justify the narrative and sharp minds accounting for both retail capital as well as institutional capital will start to position themselves for what is to come. This is the point where we are currently at, waiting for the next move up and for this bus to get going.\n\nPhase 3, arriving at the stadium:\n\n\\- Word is spreading of a new investment opportunity and this will likely be marked by the price per pound of uranium going over the 40 dollar mark. As was mentioned above, price movement justifies the narrative and 40 dollar is the first \u2018line in the sand\u2019 where we will see increased interest from institutional capital wanting to position themselves for this bull market. This phase can be the shortest or the longest of all of the 6 phases depending on a number of key factors that need to be paid close attention to.\n\nPhase 4, the game begins:\n\n\\- This is where the bulk of investors will come in. While we are not early anymore, we are well into this bull market and it still has some legs left. Some people might start taking profits here and leave before the game ends. This can be a smart plan, as scaling out into strength will save you from being hit by phase 6 once it rolls around. In this phase it is clear we are in a full-fledged bull market and it will become more and more regularly discussed by investment communities. Institutional money will be well positioned at this point and will look for a possible exit. I am currently writing an exit strategy on it, based both on history, market psychology and asset valuations. I am not able to share this, as it wouldn\u2019t be fair to my platform, so I apologize for that. This phase will likely be the most volatile as a whole.\n\nPhase 5, the final minutes:\n\n\\- As with every highly cyclical bull market, all good things most come to an end. Just like with a game that is all tied a few minutes before the final whistle, emotions are running high and you will see people scrambling to get a glance at the game. This is when general media such as CNBC and investors on social media will be talking about uranium as being \u201cthe next big thing\u201d. This is a massive red flag. Yes, you might want to watch this game till the end, but it is much better to try and get out before the mass euphoria reaches its peak. When you see that uranium is as broadly discussed as things like digital meme dogs or EV's for example are right now and spot price severely overshooting the long term price, there is no reason to not take out most of your profits and watch this game go into phase 6.\n\nPhase 6, the game ends (2025):\n\n\\- As I said before, all cyclical bull markets must eventually come to an end and this one will be no different. While the timing of this, which I think will be somewhere around 2025, is nothing more than a calculated bet (it could be longer, but also shorter, depending on prevailing market specific but also broad equity market circumstances), fact remains that the final blow off peak we saw in phase 5 in the final minutes of the game will be just as steep to the downside. This will leave a lot of people holding the bag and it will be a rough wake up call, don\u2019t be left standing when the doors close and the lights go out.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhen a game is exciting, you want to stay till the end to make sure you don\u2019t miss anything, this is very understandable as it is human nature to want to get the most out of something. However, the risk associated with trying to time the whistle to the minute is not worth it in my opinion. This doesn\u2019t mean you should sell before the bus even arrives at the stadium, but perhaps it is smart to consider scaling out every few minutes and leave only a very small position (or nothing at all of course) to watch the final minutes of this game. Phases and associated timelines can shift very quickly, so make sure you are adaptive, patient and disciplined, because this will be quite the game and no one will know how long it will last. It could be 4 years, but it could also only be 1 or 2. You have to be adaptive and make sure you have the right information and strategy to make the most of this opportunity. Thank you for reading and as always I wish you all a great day.",

Do not underestimate the entire World and this vaccine. Yes we are off to a good start in America but the rest of the World is way behind and in dire need of supply. PFE has shown great leadership in production and distribution along with there partner BioNtech. When you hear about vaccine you here the Top 2 common names that for people who do want vaccine, would like the get. PFE or Moderna.\n\nWhy buy PFE now? They are posting RECORD sales and trading under 52 week high.\n\nThey are forecasted to continue making vaccine money well into 2022 and 2023 with multiple countries signing supply contracts. See Europe, Canada, America...\n\nBooster shot is likely to cover variants. Additional income.\n\nNot buying yet?\n\nPfizer has requested emergency approval for adolescents 12 - 15 year olds.in America which has been reportwd to authorize very soon, also in Europe.  Not to mention they will be soon asking for all ages as soon as phase 3 studies completed and verified.... If people want 2022 school year uninterrupted it will most likely happen.\n\nStill not with me?\n\nMrna is around to stay, Pfizer is in development of treatment for Covid-19 for active cases. Of which there is only one approved treatment. No, Not (Hydroxychloroquine) its Remdesivir. If they get a treatment for Covid-19 this could be another major catalyst. They are researching Mrna uses in many other areas now. Not just Covid-19. The CEO has recently said they will be in development for other uses.\n\nPFE is trading below 52 week highs and under 5 year highs.\n\nMy position is small. I was able to convert one $37 C  5/21 and plan to hold my 100 shares as a Pandemic reminder. I still have four $37 C 5/21 which I plan to hold until PFE hits past its 5 year high which I believe will be coming soon.\n\nThere are Bearish cases... Do your own DD, this is not financial advice.\n\nStill uncertain? Well if you held on this long. Pfizer ex-dividend is 5/6. So not only can you buy a stock thats just beat earnings, sales, future outlook. You can do something truly Boomer. EARN DIVIDENDS all on a company breaking sales records and trading under its PRE-PANDEMIC highs. Just take a look at this boomer stock. I plan on holding my shares and one day looking back at these crazy years. Just like I bought my 1 share of another stock thay shall not be named.... you know what it is!",

But Robinhood's restricted list was way bigger and included stocks such as AMD, AAL, BYND, GM, IPOE, MRNA, and SBUX. I had got into stocks in January 2021 as a new years resolution. Which was a couple weeks before the GME stuff and reddit trading was even all over the news. At the time I honestly thought the buying restriction was something a part of the stock market. As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. \n\nNow that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that. They limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside. I really hope that doesn't happen again.",

        "selftext": "The Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.\n\nThe lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.\n\nCurrent sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.\n\nAlso, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!\n\nThe Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.\n\nELI5: Basically all the stocks that have crashed because the companies don't generate free cash flow will go up again.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** = MindMed will solve and own the hundred-billion dollar market to treat depression, alcoholism, opioid addiction, anxiety, PTSD \n\nMindMed will be releasing their **Phase 2** results using **LSD to treat anxiety** very soon which was completed May 1, 2021! [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03153579](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03153579)\n\nSold off from NASDAQ, now institutions are going to load the boat. Also short interest is pretty high, so a big bounce is coming. \n\n\\----------\n\n**Background on the Sector**\n\nThere are three topics everyone who wants to understand the Psychedelic Sector needs to know up front:\n\n**1) Intent:** This sector is fundamentally different from the Cannabis Sector in a large way. The target market is primarily medicinal uses rather than recreational uses. Cannabis has a large recreational movement, where psychedelics have a small one. While this may deter some folks, I find it reassuring: to play in this space a company must be serious and committed.\n\n**2) Diversity:** There are a number of drugs in the psychedelic space - psilocybin (mushrooms), LSD (acid), MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine (anesthetic), to name a few. Each is in some stage of clinical trials, and each company is attempting to use different ones to treat different mental and behavioral health conditions. These conditions are diverse as well, though the largest target markets include ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and drug and alcohol addiction.\n\n**3) Delivery:** Psychedelic research today is not seeking to put high volumes of over-the-counter mushrooms or LSD pills in your local CVS. Psychedelics are being researched in controlled microdoses, and the intended delivery is by trained therapists through guided psychotherapy sessions. Psychedelics on their own may give your mind a period of disconnection and subdued feelings of fear, but with proper guidance from a trained therapist this period also becomes an opportunity for \"rewiring\" old mental blocks that lead to mental illness. Some people begin to break through chronic mental health barriers in just a few appointments. CNN recently covered the sector in an hour long special under Lisa Ling's \"This is Life\" series called \"Psychedelic Healing\" (Season 7, Episode 6). This demonstrates the delivery method well, as well as several early success stories.\n\n**MindMed DD --&gt; Kevin O'Leary, Bruce Linton and the Najarian Brothers are in this**\n\nThough my summary is below, don\u2019t just take my word for it! MindMed has an incredibly well organized [website](https://mindmed.co/) where you can see much of this for yourself.\n\n*As an investor in a sector with a diversity of molecules and a diversity of applications*, you want a company that has a diverse approach. **That\u2019s MindMed** \\- which is in Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials with each 18-MC, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and psilocybin tackling a variety of conditions, including anxiety, opioid withdrawal, ADHD, and cluster headaches, to name a few. This diversity give MindMed a high chance of having not just one, but several breakthrough molecules. Kevin O\u2019Leary (yes, Shark Tank\u2019s Mr. Wonderful) is perhaps the most well-known investor in MindMed.\n\n*As an investor in a sector that requires integration with therapists*, including new tools and training, you want a company that is developing more than just the necessary drugs. **MindMed is the whole package.** MindMed has paired with NYU to develop therapist training strategies and has announced its launch of Albert, a digital medicine division meant to tie it all together. MindMed's recent announcements have indicated they are actively hiring to give this division more depth and to potentially undertake an acquisition in the digital platform space. MindMed is already thinking about **how** we make this work. In the future, a therapist will have use this digital tool to keep a list of psychedelic options catered to a host of mental conditions, and each will be tied to delivery strategies and training. MindMed's wholistic view from clinical trials through implementation is what sets them apart from others in the sector.\n\n*As an investor in a sector that is \"breakthrough\" in nature*, you want a company that has the right leadership. In January, Robert Barrow entered the MindMed team as the Chief Development Officer. Robert brings extensive knowledge of psilocybin research, but more importantly he was part of securing the Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA for his prior psilocybin program (Phase 2 Clinical Trials) at the Usona Institute. MindMed hopes to secure similar breakthrough designations for their trials and fast-track them. **Bruce Linton**, former Canopy Growth (CGC) Chairman and CEO, sits on MindMed's Board of Directors. Dr. Halperin Wernli and Carol Nast, President and COO respectively, each help round out the management team with over 50 combined years of leadership in drug and product development in emerging markets and heavily regulated environments.\n\nFinally, I know every investor wants to know how much the stock price will move over time, so here are a few catalysts to think on:\n\n**Next catalysts:** This is more obvious, but of course any trial milestones are catalysts! I\u2019m particularly excited about August/September this year when we expect Phase 2b trial results to begin rolling in, though Phase 1 announcements will continue to occur as the portfolio grows as well. With any luck, breakthrough designations will accelerate trials and portfolio growth further.",

I'm hearing many people claim it will be more than double this come the next earnings report on May 17th.\n\nFor some quick background - CLOV, or Clover Health Investments, is a healthcare technology company that has been on the rise for quite some time now. They've been increasing their member count substantially and each member has pulled in more profit for the company as time moves forward.\n\nRight now I think that the company is OVERWHELMINGLY UNDERVALUED.\n\nThis is not just a 'potential meme' stock, but it is definitely a long-term growth stock with investors in mind.\n\nRight now the company is approaching $10 per share with a prior peak at ~$17.07 back in December, and a low of around ~$7.29 in March (for reference).\n\nThe stock appears to hang around the $10 mark generally, but search traffic has been increasing (checked using google trends) and I'm hearing a lot of talk with the next earnings report. Combine this with a higher volatility, this leads me to believe CLOV might be my lucky stock of choice that will bring me to paradise \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\n\nI'm trying to start a mini-discussion here of the potential of CLOV as both a long-term and short-term investment.

The question remains, how do we solve the problem. Some say 'do less, eat less' but I'd argue that this is anathema to humanity and obviously isn't going to work fast enough.

Basically a metric ton of [funding](https://agronomics.im/) was handed out in 2020 once these companies solved the FBS problem, massively accelerating their progress to the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n**Important Points:**\n\n[Global meat, poultry and seafood market is growing to $7.3 trillion.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-meat-poultry-seafood-market)\n\n**That's a lot of money.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Up to 99% of meat farming in America is factory farming.](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates)\n\n**Vast majority of consumers do not care about quality, just price.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[According to American Human's survey nearly 95% of participants are \"very concerned\" about the welfare of farm animals.](https://awionline.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/fa-consumer_perceptionsoffarmwelfare_-112511.pdf)\n\n**People feel guilty about it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[84% of vegetarians return to eating meat.](https://www.thehealthy.com/food/vegetarians-vegans-go-back-meat/)\n\n**Buuuut people want/need meat.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\"If 1955 beef production practices were used today, we\u2019d need 165 million more acres of land to produce the same output.\"](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/200456/could-we-survive-without-factory-farming-the-low-price-of/)\n\n**Producing meat at todays consumption level ethically is impossible.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Animal Husbandry is the second largest contributer to human made greenhouse gas emissions and the leading cause of deforestation, water and air pollution.](https://climatenexus.org/climate-issues/food/animal-agricultures-impact-on-climate-change/)\n\n**Legislation incoming.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Future Meat Technologies](https://www.future-meat.com/) says [its cultured products will take up 99% less land, 96% less freshwater and emit 80% less greenhouse gases than traditional meat production](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/lab-grown-meat-could-exacerbate-climate-change-scientists-say.html)\n\n**Self reported but reasonable when taking into account future economies of scale.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what to do.\n\nPeople don't like doing less, people don't like feeling bad, solve the problem as ever with technology.\n\nWe simply skip the cow and grow the burger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is there competition from Big Meat?**\n\nAs of yet, no, in fact, the opposite. Everyone knows the story of how the auto industry has been trying to crush or minimise electric cars for the last hundred years and are only recently and extremely reluctantly developing their own.\n\nNot so with the meat industry, big players have instead invested directly into the growing new industry, could there be a greater approval than multi million investment, green lit by analysts and board, from the industry you intend to displace?\n\n[https://euromeatnews.com/Article-Tyson-Foods-announces-investment-in-clean-meat/697](https://euromeatnews.com/Article-Tyson-Foods-announces-investment-in-clean-meat/697)\n\nBig Players supporting the tech\n\nBill Gates, Richard Branson, Founder of Google, Richard Reed (innocent drinks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Optimistic speculation**\n\nCurrently the tech is in infancy and producing simple produce, however there is little perceivable upper limit for the technology, want a perfect Wagyu steak for half the price of a real cheap offcut?

Currently 99.99% of budget is spent on R&amp;D and funding as it should be. As they begin to come to market more will be spent on marketing, outreach etc...\n\nPersonally everyone I've talked to starts with the ick reaction, then shortly after admits they'd try it, then after debating the 'important points' believes in it's inevitability.\n\nCriticism of carbon footprint = solved by intentionally linking up with renewable energy sources.

Okay good stuff.\n\nThen some shit short selling report from Hidenburg research came out accusing them of some bad practices and a DOJ investigation.  That shit was overhyped and short sellers jumped on that and started shorting\u2026. They shorted it down to about 7 bucks, that was a hella bargain price to get in it. Lots of companies get summoned to provide information by the DOJ, its really not a big deal, but was overhyped.\n\nNow this company is legit.  Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurer that combines technology and preventive care to lower costs and increase the quality of life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- They have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive.\n\n\\- Biden and democrats are looking to lower the medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.\n\n\\- Short interest is above 35% \u2026 so yes possible squeeze potential too.\n\n\\- Board of directors has got Chelsea Clinton on it, and she is obviously tight with the democratic party. \n\n\\- They moved earnings up\u2026. Which is usually a good sign.\n\n\\- There are 360k calls expiring on May 21, and earnings are a couple days before on May 17th. (only 56k puts, so the call to put ratio is pretty damn high)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has got some real potential to double by earnings, maybe even more.\n\n I got in a bit late and bought high, dont be me and get in early on monday!\n\nPosition: 4531 shares at $10.72 - and (16) May 21st, $11 call options.

Not advice do your own DD. \n\nDD \n\n\u2022 housing market is INSANE right now. Many houses being sold well above asking price. Housing shortage throughout the country. 4 million houses short of buyer demand (per WSJ HERE: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-market-is-nearly-4-million-homes-short-of-buyer-demand-11618484400) \n\n\u2022 Fed is keeping interest rates low, which is incentivizing people to buy, refinance, and so forth. Anecdote, I refinanced my house in February because it was only $3,000 cost to me, but I would save buckets over the life of the loan. \n\n\u2022 Rising cost of lumber is forcing new homes to be more expensive. Thus, mortgage companies are financing *more* money. \n\n\u2022 $RKT releases earnings on Wednesday, which will be a huge catalyst of what\u2019s to come. Last earnings they went through the roof, gaining near 100% in the short term. \n\n\u2022 $RKT\u2019s competition $LDI smashed earnings this morning with $0.98 EPS, compared to an expected $0.58 EPS. LDI seems to be a much smaller company, and I think this could be indicative of a huge beat for RKT. \n\n\u2022 currently 8% short interest (pretty low, but the stock itself also has relatively low volume)\n\nThoughts?",

Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why buy?**\n\n$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. \n\nThey say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. \n\nAs a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chip shortage.**\n\nThe elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. \n\nBut I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final thought**\n\nEnd of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.\n\nAs always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cznh9hm6j3x61.png?width=1384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f982f936b4337cca2f1b63452b526fc0045cda1b",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9\n\n Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan\u201921 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. \n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007\n\n Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.\n\n**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.\n\n**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.\n\n**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm \u2013 Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.\n\n**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.\n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nCan I use the code/is it open source: Yes.\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "So, let me get this straight. We criticized MVIS for having a \u201clarge\u201d 2b market cap and so now we all suddenly support Nokia with a market cap of 25.1b? That\u2019s 12x more than MVIS. \n\nNOK Income statement for year ended 2020:\n\nRatio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 13,659,000/21,852,000 = 62.5%. This means 62.5% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 37.5% is what the company kept as gross profit. \n\nMVIS income statement for year ended 2020:\n\nRatio of cost of revenue to total revenue: \n1,398/3090 = 45.24%. This means 45.24% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 54.76% is what the company kept as gross profit.\n\nAll prices listed from income statements are in millions of dollars. Yes Nokia is bringing home more money, but they aren\u2019t raking it in as efficiently as MVIS. Because MVIS is a much much smaller company than NOK, their differences in the dollar amount of gross profit is to be understood. But my original statement still stands, MVIS is \u201ctaking home a bigger % of their pie\u201d for profits, because they are better than NOK at mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs. \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at their D./T.A. Ratio. This will give us insight to which degree debt is used to finance assets for each company. The lower the ratio, the better the company is at using that debt to finance assets.\n\nNOK DTA: 6,486,000/36,191,000 = 17.92%. This means, in laymen\u2019s terms, that for every $100 of assets, NOK accumulated $17.92 in debt. \n\nMVIS DTA: 3,107/21,006 = 14.79% This means, in laymen\u2019s terms, that for every $100 of assets, MVIS accumulated $14.79 in debt. \n\nMVIS does a much better job, as previously stated, at mitigating losses and staying efficient. Not to mention, because MVIS is researching extremely new technology, much of their funding will be for R&amp;D - much more R&amp;D is needed for sensors that didn\u2019t exist a few years ago, over the R&amp;D needed for a new phone or cellular service which has already been around for decades. If MVIS is able to have a lower DTA ratio, developing \u201cnew to this world\u201d technology, than a company that has been making phones longer than we\u2019ve been alive, then how is it a bad buy? How is NOK a better buy?\n\nI know typically DDs are not suppose to take into account the comparison between other stocks, but too many of you have fallen into this NOK train that will leave you at a $4.50+ cost basis, and suddenly NOK will start trading sideways at $4.10 for the next coming years, and you\u2019re nah holding. Have fun making 3 cents a share per year. That\u2019s pussy shit I didn\u2019t come here for. \n\nNot financial advice, I literally failed Finance 304. Professor was an ass.",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 3) - $AMC, $ROKU, $SQ, $ETSY, $Z, $PTON, $RKT, $CRSR, $MT, and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 3 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI fucking love earnings season. It\u2019s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What\u2019s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they\u2019re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\n\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their \"true\" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.\n\n- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.\n\n- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraid. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.\n\n- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.\n\n- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin\u2019 companies, theres plenty that I\u2019ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I\u2019d love to see what you guys come up with.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there\u2019s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",

        "selftext": "Here\u2019s something interesting to consider from a more technical options standpoint: right now there is unusually high open interest in CLOV calls (a significant portion being out of the money). These calls are often written by market makers, who need to hedge their short calls by purchasing stock. As you know, gamma squeezes occur as the stock rises and more of these call options go in the money and the whales buy up stock to hedge their risk. Here is another part of the puzzle many people are missing: the amount of stock they buy to hedge is often related to the delta of the option (so they can remain delta neutral). Hence, the higher the delta of a contract, the more shares the market maker needs to buy in order to hedge the risk. Here\u2019s another fact: vanna (the second order Greek, measuring delta sensitivity with respect to implied volatility) is (typically) positive. This means that if implied volatility goes up, delta will go up, and market makers will have to purchase more shares to remain market neutral. Now here\u2019s the kicker: as earnings approach, implied volatility will usually, particularly in shorter term contracts, skyrocket. Couple this with the fact that the May 21 expiration is very close to earnings, deltas across the board will quite possibly rise substantially in the days before earnings, forcing market makers to buy up huge chunks of stock to hedge, and hence potentially driving up the price by a tremendous deal.\n\nThis is all speculation. I cannot stress enough that there is no guarantee that this is the case. This theory could fail for a number of reasons: these calls may simply be retail investors who aren\u2019t bound by any delta neutral strategies or anything of the sort; the stock may drop before earnings and hence the increase in implied volatility could fail to offset the change in underlying's effect on delta; the market makers simply buy the calls back at a premium from paper-handed option buyers, taking a loss; or there is sufficient downward pressure/selling momentum at the time that the market makers could simply buy a lot of stock without drastically increasing the price. That's why I need to say: please please please only invest if you genuinely believe in the stock and can afford to lose whatever you put in. The stock market is risky business - nothing is guaranteed and you can always lose a lot of money if you make poor decisions. In fact, you can lose a lot of money even if you make really good decisions and the market turns against you.\n\n(This is not financial advice - please do your own due diligence and only risk capital you can actually afford to lose. I myself have invested about 10k in LEAPs, short term options, and then another few thousand in shares.)",

        "selftext": "Right now, I see a unique options play on RKT earnings. If you were to acquire some OTM call options for the may 7th 23.50 strike, if the calls go in the money and you pay 50 bucks for each contract, we are talking just about 47x ROI over a 5 day or less time period. \n\nCurrent vol and open interest on the call side is rather high. We are not seeing a ton of trading volume for the shares of RKT, but I personally believe this is the calm before the storm. \n\nTherefore - I believe the price of RKT call options are grossly mispriced and the potential for the stock to move 10% or higher shortly before and after earnings is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-40%. Historically this has happened before so it's not outside the realm of possibility. Because the stock stays stable for so long, calls are much cheaper than gambling on something like MVIS or GME (I guess due to implied volatility being lower comparatively). \n\nThe keener among you may have seen how this played out with short dated Tesla options on last Friday. The stock was trading down.. then did a complete upwards reversal, turning 1500 dollar call options into 30-50000 dollars in one day. \n\nUsually I never take the risk on short dated OTM calls but this time it's different. I think there is too much evidence stacking up to the fact that RKT has something under their sleeves for this earnings call. Fundmentally I expect a strong beat.. but they could also announce another special dividend or stock buyback. This is your time to buy the rumor sell the news. \n\nTLDR, buy lots of RKT call options expiring 5/7 at the 23.50 strike or higher  \n\n# \ud83d\ude80 \n\n# \ud83d\ude80 \n\n# \ud83d\ude80 \n\n# \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)\n\nBelow is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):\n\n1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let\u2019s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) \u2013 a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover\u2019s business model is so fool proof!  \n***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***\n2. **Competition:** Now let\u2019s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.  \n***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***\n3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover\u2019s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.  \n***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***\n4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let\u2019s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/) in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this\u2026as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn\u2019t\u2026.60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover\u2019s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).  \n***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***\n5. **Customers:** Let\u2019s now put some light on the target demographic\u2026seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.\n6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance\u2026except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money\u2026now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.\n7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock \u2013 he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as a board member.**\n8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \\~$3B, which is \\~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover\u2019s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated\u2026upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond\u2026.it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space \u2013 TDOC \u2013 and a Cathie Wood &amp; ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.  \n***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***\n\nI am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.",

        "selftext": " People seem confused about Nikola\u2019s worth. Let\u2019s try to clear things up. \n\nTo get into the EV stocks, best thing is to understand a bit about EV\u2019s.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between: electric vehicles, powered electric vehicles and plug-in vehicles?  Also what is the difference between hydrogen vehicles and electric vehicles? So, here is a simple explanation. \n\n**Electric, power electric and plug-in are all the same**: They run on electricity,  use a lithium battery and **need to be re-charged by plugging them into a socket.** \n\n**The hydrogen vehicles are also electric.** But, instead of a lithium battery, they have a hydrogen tank that produces the electricity. So they are similar to regular vehicles in that, **when needed, you fill up the tank, just, instead of gas, you fill it up with hydrogen.**\n\n**Pros of hydrogen vehicles?** It takes five minutes to fill up the tank.There isn\u2019t a \u201crange\u201d problem with them. In theory, you can drive them very long distances as long as you have a hydrogen station along the way.\n\nAs opposed to lithium batteries. You can drive a Tesla about 200 miles before you need to recharge it. Yep, Tesla will tell you it\u2019s 400 miles, but practically, it\u2019s 200 (400 would be if you are driving alone, no passengers, in a straight line with nothing stopping you all the way, (like a traffic light) or slowing you down (like slopes, curves, bad weather). \n\nThis is a HUGE difference. Think about it. 200 miles is a 3 hour drive at 70 miles per hour. If you have a 4 hour drive, you will need to recharge the battery for AT LEAST one hour, and probably way more. Your 4 hour drive just turned into a 7-8 or more hours\u2026And that is IF you have where to charge along the way.\n\nA hydrogen car you just need to refill the tank and be on your way. That sounds awesome. \n\n**Where is the catch**? Well, there are about 40000 electric charging stations in the USA. That is a solid number when compared to a bit over 100,000 regular gas stations. So, if you own an electric car, you have a decent chance of charging it. Although it might take you 4-8 hours, don\u2019t forget. \n\nMeanwhile, there are like...wait for it...45 hydrogen stations in all of the USA. So, basically, if you have a hydrogen car (you don\u2019t, it\u2019s really experimental at this point), you don\u2019t have where to fill up your tank. \n\nThe other problem with hydrogen vehicles: to \u201cproduce\u201d the hydrogen, you need power. It doesn\u2019t just \u201cexist\u201d. So you need to \u201cmanufacture\u201d it, so to speak. Nowadays, that costs too much. That is ONE reason Elon Musk says hydrogen cars are stupid. (He is only right as long as making hydrogen remains expensive\u2026)\n\n**But electric cars also have some important issues:**\n\nYou see, creating electricity has a price. That price depends on how you create that energy. Some electricity is super cheap, like that created using the sun, the wind or even nuclear energy. Others are expensive. Some countries have lots of electricity, others don\u2019t. Some can create clean electricity. Others need to pollute the air in order to make electricity.\n\nSo 1st problem: electricity. If all cars would be electric cars, it would be a HUGE problem to provide electricity from a plug to all of them. In most countries or states, that wouldn\u2019t work at all.\n\n2nd huge issue with all electric cars: where to charge them. If you live in a house, have a garage, no problems. You come home, plug it in, go to sleep, in the morning the car is charged. \n\nBut if you live in an apartment building, if you park your car in the street,  if you are too busy cause when you get back from work, you son/wife etc. take the car to do shopping, night studies, night job, whatever, when and where are you going to charge the car?\n\nBottom line: the biggest problem with electric CARS is that if everyone will have them, it will eat up too much electricity, there will be nowhere to charge them, and even worse, no time to charge them. Not everyone can have an electric car, gas cars aren\u2019t disappearing that quickly. Too many private electric cars are going to become a huge headache. \n\nBut trucks on the other hand\u2026.let\u2019s think about it. Everyone wants to make electric trucks (or large vans) why? Well, it\u2019s a smaller, more manageable fleet.  They are parked at designated spots or parking lots, easier to charge in that sense, the gas/money you save by turning a truck electric as opposed to a car, is much larger, and the truck brings in revenue so that even if it\u2019s expensive, companies can offset that cost. \n\n**So now we understand:** \n\n1. Electric cars are awesome cause they are friendly to the environment, easy to maintain, and as soon as the lithium batteries become less expensive (they will, technology is making them cheaper by the day), you will be able to afford one!\n2. Electric cars aren\u2019t THAT awesome because it takes time and lots of electricity to charge them. Good luck doing a movie about a road trip using an electric car. You\u2019ll have plenty of shots of people waiting at a charging station and making small-talk\u2026\n3. Hydrogen cars can solve the charging issue except that there are no hydrogen fill up stations (almost) and hydrogen is expensive as a solution right now.\n4. The private electric car market is huge and awesome, just not as huge and as awesome as Elon Musk wants you to think it is.\n5. Trucks are actually a better market for electric vehicles in the mid-term / current long term outlook. Whoever makes a good electric truck/van is going to be in an excellent position.\n6. Equally, whoever develops hydrogen fueled cars best, will have an upper hand. \n\n**Which brings us to Nikola**. And what it has or doesn\u2019t have. One could argue that Nikola is just a bunch of ideas. And nothing else. \n\nBut that isn\u2019t accurate. \n\nThey actually have several patents to their name. Some of them are more related to visuals. What the truck would LOOK like. But others are about real technology. This is a big deal in a field that is all about new technology. If you own some of the concepts of how to transform that idea into a product, if you own that patent, then that can be worth a lot of money.\n\nNikola is suing Tesla for using some of its patents (the ones related to how the truck looks, not how it runs). Though the lawsuit has been ongoing for years and might keep going for a few more years, down the road it seems very probable that Tesla will need to pay Nikola a sizeable payday.\n\nSo Nikola has some value because of its patents, it\u2019s a real player in this new technology. \n\nThe 2nd thing we know for sure is Nikola is building a factory, and that factory is in fact being built, and it will start producing something, pretty soon. We need to understand what that something is....\n\nNikola is aiming at building an electric truck. So is Tesla. Also Ford, Daimler, Volvo...this is a market where many big names want to make a splash. And then there is Rivian. They have a 100,00 truck order (!!) from Amazon. And their IPO is coming out this year. \n\n**So now that we are EV \u201cexperts\u201d, what is Nikola worth?**\n\nNo one has a reasonable, practical EV truck (maybe except BYD. But I don\u2019t trust Chinese companies, because they do not operate with transparency, they\u2019re fishy to me). Whomever gets a good EV truck on the road is bound to see a pretty nice spike in stock value. \n\nRivian is planning on an IPO setting its initial value at 50 billion. Mind you, this is a company that has a 100,000 truck order for a truck that doesn\u2019t exist yet. Its development is advanced, and they are hoping to deliver the truck to the market in the next few months. But 50 billion, considering this number can easily go to 70 as soon as the IPO is launched, is a lot of money. \n\nNikola\u2019s current value is at 4.5 billion. They are building a factory, they have hired many, many professionals, they have patents that show they understand the technology very well, they have experience building the prototypes (through which they got the patents). They are potentially a very, very cheap stock. \n\nJust news of the factory actually working and any kind of initial pre-order doubles the price of this stock. Hold it for 2-3 years, the chances for a tenfold valuation is reasonable. \n\nAs far as Nikola\u2019s hydrogen trucks. I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. They need to set up the infrastructure to have hydrogen stations for filling up the tank at a national level. That is just billions of dollars in costs. They need to create the technology that lowers the cost of providing the hydrogen. That still doesn\u2019t exist at a satisfying level. I wouldn\u2019t build on that as an investor. If they do somehow get that going, their value increases through the roof. But if they start focusing on it too much, they could waste lots of money, like they have done before. \n\n**Bottom line:** NKLA isn\u2019t as dead as people think, IMO. It has value, it has a real plan, it\u2019s focusing on the right market (the trucks) and it will be worth way more. It isn\u2019t going up anytime soon. But it\u2019s a good time to get in. \n\nI\u2019m not an advisor, I do not own NKLA stocks right now but plan on owning a position at some point in 2021. I just thought people would benefit from understanding this EV thing better.",

        "selftext": "Hear me out apes I think I may of found an exploit that can be utilized for maximize leverage with downside protection through housing.\n\nFirst you take advantage of the historically booming mortgage market and low interest rates by taking out as many mortgages as you can afford through a mortage brokers tied to a public traded stock (RKT for example).  Then using the houses that you now own you take out additional loans which you use the proceeds to wheel (sell calls/puts) into gold/silver/platinum.  As you keep gathering more premium and your house values goes up slowly (while interest rates mostly stay stagnant as the feds are afraid of crashing the market) you take out more loans and sell more puts.  Hopefully by the time the housing market crashes your wheeling account will have accumulated enough in value to pay off its mortagages on it own through wheeling.  Since gold and other commodities tend to go up during market/housing crashes during the downturn you will be able to pay off your mortagages through the gains you will see in your wheeling account.  If housing keeps booming you keep getting more loans out (or sell/pay them off to reduce risk and realize gains).  At some point later you you sell your housing for nice gains or refinance and take our more mortgages.  If things go sideways your wheeling premiums will keep you afloat, while you slowly whittle away at your mortagages.  \n\nThe way I see it is your houses you buy is almost like buying a LEAP call so you can sell options covered. \n\nAm i missing something here?

Those narratives would suggest that restaurants, hotels, airlines, and auto manufacturers are all flying high right now. The problem is, none if it is true.\n\nSince February\u2026\n\n* Tripadvisor, Expedia, and Booking are flat\n* Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt are flat\n* Ford, GM, and Toyota are flat\n* Restaurants are mixed\n* Airlines are down\n\nThe real rotation isn\u2019t toward any of that.

Since February, anything young people actually want to invest in has been annihilated: technology, e-commerce, semiconductors, renewable energy, cannabis, disruptive tech, EVs, and so on.

There is \\*a lot\\* happening beneath the surface and the coming few months will, in my view, prove to be significant.\n\nHere is the first part of the Bear Traps Report with my own added comments as well:\n\nIn 2020, six nuclear reactors were connected to the gnd. Of these, Belarus and the UAE opened their first nuclear reactors. This, despite the pandemic. We expect this trend to continue over the balance of the century. There are currently 108 planned nuclear reactors globally at various stages of the approval funding process. Different countries get different percentages from nuclear reactors, a sample: China, 4.9%; India, 3.2%, Japan, 7.5%, UK 15.6%, USA, 19.7%. The take away is that between China, the UK and the USA, alone, there is plenty of potential growth in nuclear reactor electricity supply and, of course, these countries have the financial wherewithal to fund the requisite nuclear reactors to go green should consensus so direct.\n\nProduction from mining (in tonnes U) for 2019 was. 22,808 from Kazakhstan: 6,938 from Canada, 6,613 from Australia, 5,476 from Namibia, estimated 3,500 from Uzbekistan 2,983 from Russia, estimated 1,885 from China, 801 from Ukraine, and 67 from the USA Production in the U.S. has been in steady decline: 2014 = 1,919, 2015 = 1,256, 2016 = 1,125, 2017 = 940, 2018 = 582, 2019 = 67. \n\nThe main takeaway here is there is a seemingly strong geopolitical risk component to Uranium supply. U.S. production has essentially evaporated, an extremely bullish fact for forward Uranium pricing given Biden's pro-nuclear stance. Production of Uranium concentrate in the U.S. has fallen steeply and steadily (pounds U308): 2,422,789 for 2017, 1,446,496 for 2018, 173,875 for 2019. In the first quarter of 2020-8,989 vs 58,481 in first quarter 2019 vs 226,780 first quarter 2018 and 450,215 first quarter of 2017.  \n \n\nOverall, nuclear power provides about 11% of global electricity output. Demand grows alapually in the single digits. Because of low prices, global Uranium supply is down 25%. If prices double, mines will reopen and consolidate. If the U.S. alone decides to go big on nuclear prices will at least double. And assuming prices double, supply will be adequate to power U.S. nuclear ambitions. It goes both ways. The U.S. produces but 7% of its own demand, with 93% dependent on imports. \"For strategic issues such as power supply and defense, this is not a healthy situation, and therefore the plan was made for a strategic stockpile, \"Gabi Schneider, the executive director of the Namibian Uranium Institute, explains, adding it is ultimately the US's goal to expand uranium production domestically in order to shrink, or halt outright, U.S. imports of Uranium. \n\nThe U.S. goverment's Uranium strategic stockpile effort passed last December is a key, and telling, first step. At the state level, legislatures have begun passing laws that set up support for nuclear reactors. This represents a big shift from half a century ago. The Biden administration is pro-nuclear power. China's nuclear reactor capacity is set to grow from 46 GWe in 2020 to 108 GWe by 2030. We expect ground to be broken for nuclear reactors over the balance of this decade in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Poland. Projects have begun in Turkey, Bangladesh and Egypt. So it's not just a question of the wealthiest countries jumping in. \n\nConsensus thought on Uranium has been remarkably stupid, missing the supply cuts, missing the 5x move in conversion prices (UF6), missing the 40% rise in SWU (enrichment) prices, and missing the recent run up in spot prices (U308). Basically, consensus can't even think one step ahead when it comes to basic economics. It didn't occur to them that money losing mines would be shut down.\n\nThe US needs to guarantee greater uranium supply. For that it needs U.S. mines to reopen and consolidate. For that Uranium prices have to double. The new U.S. Uranium stockpile could prove a key component to that price shift. Uranium just entered supply deficit Kazakhstan's Uranium production forecast is for its Uranium production to peak next year and to go into serious decline post 2030.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this comes down to one simple fact, it is that we are running out of time for uranium prices to get going and the longer this doesn\u2019t happen, the higher the eventual price overshoot to try and make up for a decade of lost capex investments and exploration. If utilities come to the table within the next 12 months, some form of price control can be asserted and perhaps a slower run up into a price of roughly 60-65 dollars with a small overshoot to around 80 dollars by 2024 might be the most probable scenario. If they don\u2019t though, we might be looking at triple digit uranium once more. One massive new catalyst that was brought to the table recently was the fact the coming into existence of the Sprott Uranium Trust. The bear traps report names 9 reasons why this will likely have significant implications for the broad uranium market:  \n\n\nUranium Participation Corp was a company that was buying U and sitting on it, the original yellow cake. The market will now have daily price discovery and a retail / family office / small asset manager speculation vehicle. This is a game changer. Now we have a new team taking over (Sprott). Very bullish for uranium. Why? Here is why:\n\n1. We are getting a U.S. listed vehicle with a physical redemption Like a GLD for uranium. Look at PSLV and PHYS, equivalent.\n\n2. A new mechanism for retail, institutional. An at the market facility. Technically a closed end fund, NOT a GLD.\n\n3. Pounds come in, don't go out. They could do a buyback if the market provides that opportunity.\n\n4. Uranium Participation Corp is tough to buy, pink sheet. Many online brokers didn\u2019t offer it, but now there will be a new liquidity vehicle that is far more widely available.\n\n5. Management transition from Denison to Sprott. Think Industry player to real asset mgr.\n\n6. When there is large premium new buyers are vulnerable. This has suppressed upside momentum NOW there is a liquid vehicle, large buyers can come in with a liquidity work out.\n\n7. Next, Sprott does a big offering to bring in new pounds into the fund. There was too much inventory of uranium in the system, this vehicle will eliminate this problem. New size buyers of the fund will quickly translate into spot buying!\n\n8. Think CME and oil this could be a new real franchise /a liquidity central facility\n\n9. Management take over might take 2/3 months. Then the premium U Part will come in, was 16% today in a month or so Dan Loeb can come in and buy $100m without the premium risk pounds will permanently be removed from the mkt NOT an ETF, it\u2019s a closed end fund. A discount may develop in the shares but new buyers are in a much better spot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat marks the end of this uranium market update and I hope you enjoyed the read. With so much happening both in front as well as behind the scenes, hopefully I can be of aid to help you traverse this opaque market in the best way possible. We are at the foot of what will undoubtably prove to be a generational event, but it will be an extremely volatile and wild market all the way up and eventually down as well. If you got any questions or comments, my dm\u2019s are always open. As always I wish you all a good and healthy rest of your day and good luck out there in the markets, cheers!",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it\u2019s justified, given their clickbait titles or \u201c5 can't miss stocks of the century\u201d or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,\n\n&gt;If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it\u2019s that Motley Fool is utter trash\n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool\u2019s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X\u2019ed the S&amp;P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.\n\nBasically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.\n\n**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&amp;P500 returns during the same period.\n\na. One-Quarter\n\nb. One Year\n\nc. Two Year\n\nd. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)\n\nAnother feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday\u2019s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).\n\n**Results:**\n\n**Performance of Motely Fool Premium Recommendations** \n\n|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|**SPY**|**Change over SPY**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|One Quarter|6%|3%|3%|\n|One Year|24%|11%|13%|\n|Two Year|67%|20%|47%|\n|Till Date|134%|71%|63%|\n\n As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool\u2019s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \\~2X and two-year returns were \\~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&amp;P benchmark. \n\n**Performance of Motely Fool Sell Recommendations** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|\n|:-|:-|\n|If you followed Fool's Sell Recommendations|134%|\n|If you did not follow Fool's Sell Recommendations|167%|\n\nBut it\u2019s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla\u2019s 2020 rally.\n\n**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**\n\nThe stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool\u2019s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.\n\nBut I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.\n\n&gt;We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&amp;P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&amp;P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it\u2019s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.\n\nWhatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to Motley Fools.*",

And what I can bring to Palantir is my expertise as a clinician, as a public health doc, as somebody who has been working in this field for years to help with the science and the strategy and the relationships.\"\n\nInvesting in tech for the next pandemic\n\nIn his new role, Kassler said, he wants to help put Palantir's technology in the hands of researchers who can use it to make smart decisions in the next pandemic.\n\nHe highlighted three areas that he believes can be improved with the help of tech solutions like Palantir's: patching supply chain issues, dealing with localized surges of cases, and tackling racial and ethnic disparities.\n\nPalantir's Foundry platform has played a significant role in the U.S. government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as private companies' handling of essential supply chains. Palantir's technology allows researchers to combine and overlay datasets in ways that can make supply chain weaknesses or outbreak hotspots more obvious, allowing them to act quickly on their findings.\n\nOn the government side, the National Institutes of Health has recently begun using Palantir's platform to combine datasets from 50 different academic groups that it funds in ways that would have been cumbersome without the software.\n\nPalantir's technology helps the groups share data in ways that protects patient identities but allows them to gain more insights by analyzing a much larger dataset than they would have access to in their individual group settings. Julie Bush, who leads Palantir's federal health care work, said the data is now being used to better understand how the Covid-19 has impacted people with different backgrounds and conditions.\n\nBush said that type of broad data-sharing was less common prior to the pandemic, but that she hopes it continues after.\n\n\"People love to hoard their data,\" she said. \"And the pandemic really forced people to come together and be willing to share information and sort of set the bureaucracy aside. And, of course subject to data use agreements and other things, what we really saw was incredible collaborations happening across the government.\"\n\nKassler said he wants to see the technology used for more everyday use cases, too. One example he gave is how the Centers for Disease Control has already used the technology to help narrow the possible sources of an outbreak linked to produce. Rather than recalling produce from a large region, Palantir can help the agency trace the supply chain and pinpoint a smaller target.\n\n\"We don't know what the next pandemic will be,\" Kassler said. \"So we have to be prepared. And in order to do that we have to have invested in the systems that are able to have that situational awareness and to be able to enable organizations to respond quickly.\"",

        "selftext": "I know a lot of folks in this sub have been seeing a lot of red lately. A word of caution for those expecting it to turn around - don't expect it in the near-term. Even ignoring the news - Yellen's comments on interest rates today, for example - the big boys are likely to be defensively positioned for the next 3-6 months. \n\nTo grasp why, well, always look to the left - preferably far to the left - to gauge overall market conditions. Let's take a look at the log-scaled monthly charts (newer traders - this is a useful tip for gauging long-term trends - if a stock has been getting exponential gains, look at trends in log scale).  Virtually the entire market is looking over-stretched, and the small caps and tech plays are particularly overstretched right now. \n\n**Russell 2000 Monthly  (Highest volatility/risk)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/816d70hw45x61.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f85efd17688183633e7f6801cff41f5f9b23887\n\n**Nasdaq Monthly (Mid-high risk)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixbae25k55x61.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9f5f91187d77a48dda05b2ef1c00dc14c1bfbb3\n\n**S&amp;P 500 Monthly (mid-risk)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr92k6st55x61.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9618bc4194c5ac55dce9462a32ef63d3b276e7cc\n\n**Dow Jones Industrials (Mid risk)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y96n9ul965x61.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1042c50c409e04867103212f9020be7c63cf8abf\n\nThe key thing to keep in mind is how far price levels are from the overall long-term trend. That's going to be a good signal of the overall risk-on vs. risk-off appetite of the market, particularly over the next couple quarters. Right now we are shifting from risk-on to risk-off, and the shift is likely to continue for a little while. Overall, small-caps (and especially micro-caps) are a really bad place to be relative to other companies, and will likely continue to be so through at least the end of the summer (and I'd bet on mid-Q4). \n\nA little on fundamentals to think about too: \n\n1. We are moving from a very loose credit environment to a slightly tighter credit environment. That means micro-caps especially will be more incentivized to raise funds through equity offerings rather than taking on new debt. Which means toxic funder dilution, which is usually terrible for share prices in micro-caps. \n2. A lot of recovery plays are starting to look overbought as well, at least relative to how quickly things will open up internationally. I was bullish on airlines and hospitality, for instance, a few months ago, I'm a bit less so now. This may also be part of why the Dow looks more overstretched than the S&amp;P, and comparable to the Nasdaq, which is fairly unusual.\n\nSo, where to park your money? Right now, I'd recommend looking defensively:\n\n1. Metals/Mining stocks - both GDX and SLV are in the handles of long term cup-and-handle formations, so they should be safe bets for now. Mining also has a tendency to lag industrials because of lag times in profits/indicators - the industrial indicators spike, driving the metal prices up, which drives mining profits up, but also incentivizes more mining, which can trigger a correction. (For pennies, I like $FTSSF - First Cobalt, which is making a lot of technical progress and getting lots of strategic investment from US/Canada because of China's rare earth refining dominance)\n2. Utilities - boring, I know, but increased industrial/commercial output leads to increased energy consumption, which is what drives utilities profits. And the utilities market is still off of its peak. \n3. Latin America/Brazil - overall the market here is looking quite undervalued, and Brazil has a lot of mining (Vale is a big driver of the EWZ etf, for example) and food/bev exports, etc. Plus, Bolsonaro's slow response has led to excessive investor trepidation about Brazil, which makes it a rare undervalued sector. (**Note:** weirdly, India appears to be fully valued or overstretched, perhaps because of a more robust foreign aid response, but also probably because of broader MSCI-Asia funds flowing to China are also flowing to India, so Indian asset prices benefit because of China's apparently successful COVID containment).",

        "selftext": "I see something along the lines of \"well even professionals don't beat the market, which is why you should invest in only index funds\" plastered all over every stock subreddit, discord, and twitter feed. Now I'm not denying the success rates of these funds. I know that over the course of 10 or 20 years only a small percent beat the market. That does not in any way reflect how an individual could perform. Mutual funds with billions under management have so many things going against them that a retail trader doesn't. The first is a management fee. The manager will take somewhere in the ballpark of 1% which starts them off behind. Their career is directly tied to their performance and so there is an incredibly strong incentive to be conservative with any speculation. Due to the size of the funds they can't easily invest in small companies or more obscure opportunities. Also due to the size of the funds they raise the price as they buy and drive it down as they sell getting a worse price on both ends than a retail investor. Between these things I think a reasonable retail investor has a significant advantage over these funds and so I think making silly claims comparing the two's success rate is misleading.",

        "selftext": "The AutoMod decided this was a bad post for /r/personalfinance so I am here now.\n\nHello /r/investing I was wondering what I should do in regards to my Roth IRA, basically I am focused growth, with plans to retire at age 55-62 depending on how everything goes (IE I hit whatever number I feel is appropriate I am done). Currently I have about 9K in my Roth IRA, and 11K in my 401k,  with plans to move much of that 401k money into my Roth so it can be maxed out.\n\nMy main questions are what exactly should I read to have more confidence in what I am doing, what should I be investing in, and should I use their roboinvestor (Even with the fees).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy understanding of my options are:\n\n1. Switch to the Robo advisor, with its 0.35% fee, which seems beatable to me, but I and all of my family use Chase, so it would be convenient, and I do already kinda like YouInvest. I think vanguard is like 10% of this rate fwiw, so it seems suboptimal, although I am taking on a lot of risk managing things myself.\n2. Buy mutual funds via my Chase account, my understanding is that I will not be charged a fee whatsoever for these trades \\[Source: [https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/online-investing/pricing](https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/online-investing/pricing)\\] and this would only charge me whatever fee the mutual fund charges.\n   1. I would presumably go with something like  TTIIX, as that is what my job put my 401k into, although they also underperformed the SP500 by quite a bit. Their fee is  0.100% \\[Source: [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/ttiix/quote](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/ttiix/quote)\\]\n   2. I could also just buy VTSAX, that seems like a semi-reasonable plan.\n3. Continue my manual buying of stocks and mutual funds I like, regardless of how risky it seems.\n   1. This seems dangerous to me, my current intuition on stocks has me about at the following ratios.\n      1. 40% SPYG\n      2. 25% VTSAX and the Schwab equivalent (I was YouTube researching on separate days and both ended up suggested.\n      3. 15% ARKK\n      4. 15% Ford (Hey, I made 85%)\n      5. 5% AAPL\n\nBasically my concerns are the level of risk I am taking, and the amount that I will pay for expert advice on my little bit of money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone! Here is my Monday Newsletter :) Happy trades and please DM me with any questions you may have :)  \n**Week of 5/3/21**\n\nThe S&amp;P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.\n\nManufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit &amp; factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity &amp; labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings. \n\nThe average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](gh2b3blx1xw61 \"\nLumber Futures 6-Month Chart (LBS)\")\n\nVerizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call \u201cYahoo.\u201d Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd. \n\nChip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020\u2019s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. \n\nCisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could \u201c...\\[take\\] another six months\u2026\u201d for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. \n\nThe effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW\u2019s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, \u201c...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter\u2026\u201d So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.  \nGM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying \u201cIf you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors\u2026 these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...\u201d\n\nThe United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   \nMeanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang\u2019s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. \n\nThe increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company\u2019s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it\u2019s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. \n\nMicrosoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector. \n\n**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**\n\n**Monday, May 3rd:**  \nEstee Lauder  \nApollo Global Management Inc  \nCarvana  \nON Semiconductor Corp  \nThe Mosaic Company  \nChegg Inc.\n\n**Tuesday, April 27th:**  \nPfizer  \nT-Mobile  \nCVS  \nActivision Blizzard  \nConocoPhillips  \nSysco  \nZillow  \nXilinx  \nHelloFresh  \nUnder Armor  \nWestern Union  \nMcAfee  \n**Wednesday, April 28th:**  \nPaypal Inc.  \nUber  \nGeneral Motors  \nTwilio Inc  \nMetLife Inc  \nBudweiser Brewing Company  \nBarrick Gold Corp.  \nFranco-Nevada Corp  \nEtsy Inc  \nFox Corp  \nGoDaddy  \nZynga  \n**Thursday, April 29th:**  \nSquare  \nNintendo  \nModerna  \nMonster Beverage Corp  \nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals  \nRoku Inc  \nAIG  \nAllstate  \nWayfair Inc  \nCBS Corp  \nPeloton Interactive  \nCloudflare  \nExpedia  \nKellogg Co.  \nAlliant Energy Corp.   \nPenn National Gaming  \nNorwegian Cruise Line Ltd.  \nDropbox\n\n**Friday, April 30th:**  \nDraft Kings  \nNCsoft",

Yay! Ok, but what does this mean for my stock??  \n\n\n**If you were a holder of APHA** shares as of 5/30/21 (Friday), each of your APHA shares will turn into 0.8381 shares of TLRY. This means that if you had 100 APHA shares, you will not have 838.1 shares of TLRY. **Keep in mind there are NO fractional shares.** This means that if your shares come out to 838.1, you will only receive 838 shares of TLRY. That number is always rounded DOWN, not up and there will be NO CASH to compensate you for your fractional share (so you can lose at most 0.99 shares of TLRY depending on how much APHA you have - which is like \\~$18.56 (if TLRY is at $18.75))  \n\n\n**If you were a holder of TLRY shares** you are STILL a holder of TLRY shares. Nothing changes for you. In the announcement, the company mentions the TSX listing, but this is a [DUAL LISTING](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duallisting.asp). TLRY will continue to trade on NASDAQ. TLRY will ALSO trade under the symbol \"TLRY\" on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) starting May 5th. Really nothing for you to do here, just gives you the ability to trade them on either exchange - it provides extra liquidity.  \n\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the \"back office\" - this happens at big banks and at big hedge funds too. APHA has HALTED today and will no longer trade. TECHNICALLY you now own TLRY shares that were given to you in the merger. When those show up in your account and you have the ability to freely trade those depends on what broker you use. If you're worried about it - call them. If you want to buy TLRY today, you can. Just go buy more and then the APHA shares that converted to TLRY will be added to your position when everything settles with your broker.",

And even for the next 2 years at least I am not going to buy the house for some reason.\n\nNow for the next two years, I want to invest that principal so that it does not lose its value because of the inflation. At the same time, I don't want to lose that principal because I had worked so hard for it.\n\nTLDR:\nCan you guys suggest me some investment options so that it satisfies the following goals:\n1.

        "selftext": "Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.\n\nInvesting in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.\n\nI\u2019ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel\u2019s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.\n\n*The Fab Ahab:*\n\nAhab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel\u2019s worst king.\n\nIntel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel\u2019s giant shadow. Intel\u2019s story \u2013 to me \u2013 looks like a downfall story in the making.\n\nIntel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel\u2019s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.\n\n*Hail Mary:*\n\nI call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.\n\nAt roughly the same time as Intel\u2019s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel\u2019s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision \u2013 a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.\n\n*Intel\u2019s Fab Focus In Question:*\n\nIntel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China\u2019s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.\n\nIn any case, I don\u2019t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.\n\nAnd if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.\n\nOverall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I\u2019ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",

While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!!

        "selftext": " \n\n**Dream Office REIT Updates**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) 366 Bay Street Toronto - Recently Fully Leased**  \n\n\n  \nDream appears to have full leased 366 Bay Street. In Q4, this location was only 34% Lease due to renovations. Around 30,000 square feet was available in Q1, and the building is now showing fully leased  \n[https://leasing.dream.ca/building/366-bay-street?search=](https://leasing.dream.ca/building/366-bay-street?search=)  \n\n\n  \n366 Bay Street was recently renovated and prepped for new tenants, and should have been leased around $45/foot. The $45 / foot rate is based on the newly renovated 357 Bay Street location which was leased in Q4 at $45 / foot.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**2) 2200 Eglinton Redevelopment**  \n\n\n  \n2200 Eglinton continues to be negotiated with the city. There are still a lot of changes to be made to their redevelopment proposals, but it will get approved. The golden mile is going through major growth and redevelopment by multiple major land owners, including Dream, SmartCentres, RioCan, and Choice Properties.  \n\n\n  \nOnce approved, the proposal will add around 2.5 Million in density. That works out to about $175M, or $4/unit NAV to Dream Office valuation. This is anticipated in Q4 2021 if all goes to plan.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n**3) Dream Industrial REIT holdings by Dream Office REIT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of Q4 2020, Dream Office holdings of Dream Industrial was valued at $13.15/unit. At the end of Q1 2021, it was $13.42/unit. An increase of around 2%. This is around 10 cents a unit in NAV increase for Dream Units. \n\n  \nThe holdings by Dream office of Dream Industrial is around 1/3rd of Dream's total market cap today, or around $350,000,000. These holdings can be borrowed against, or sold. \n\n  \nWhen you consider Dream Office is trading at a Market Cap of around $1,070,000,000 yet $350,000,000 of value is Dream Industrial Units,  $175,000,000 will be recognized soon on Eglinton, and $245,000,000 of properties are unencumbered, it's pretty easy to see the mispricing of Dream Office.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**4) Buybacks Coming**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Dream's Q4 Earnings Call, Michael Cooper was adamant on buybacks.  \n\"So I would say that the NCIB, we'll get a new one on mid-August. And I would expect on we see now, if the stock is where it is, we'll use it all up.\"  \n\"Over the next few years, we do not have a lot of capital commitments, so our balance sheet remains flexible.\"  \n\"So I think we'll continue to buy back stock as much as we can. I mean one of these is, we had 114 million shares at the peak. Now we're about 54 million. So we've reduced them by more than 50 million shares.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMichael Cooper has made it clear, buybacks will begin mid August (NCIB can be renewed then, last one was used up). These buybacks are likely to be 10% of the units outstanding. As I have mentioned before in other posts, the total float not held by insiders and institutions is only around 20-25 Million. Possibly less. Buying back 5 Million units is substantial, and will leave very few units trading publicly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**5) Office Market Update**  \n\n\n  \nAllied Properties released their results last week. Some highlights from their Earnings Call:\n\n  \n\" In Toronto, we maintained our leased area at 95.8%\"  \n\"We have remained unconcerned by the amount of space available for sublease in our portfolio.\"  - Sublet Space has declined from 6% to 5.3% (Dream Office has less than 2% sublet available for lease, which is extremely low)  \n\"The team recently tallied the amount of space currently under discussion in our portfolio, not including renewals at just over one million square feet... While we will not complete all of the potential deals, we are very encouraged for future results on the level of activity today.\"  \n\n\n  \nAllied has posted a very solid quarter during Q1, even as lockdowns rocked the headlines, and businesses remained forced closed.  \n\n\n  \nThe VODI index is showing a rebound in various markets. As we exit out of COVID, and vaccinations ramp up, the reopening will drive businesses to reopen their offices, and as proven in the USA markets, office demand will pickup as pent up demand begins the recovery.  \n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210428005266/en/National-Return-to-Work-Imminent-as-Employers-Ramp-up-Efforts-to-Find-Office-Space](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210428005266/en/National-Return-to-Work-Imminent-as-Employers-Ramp-up-Efforts-to-Find-Office-Space)  \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------  \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n  \nIn conclusion, the pandemic created a buying opportunity, and quality office REITs are showing some rebounding strength in their operations. It is my belief that REITs located in high demand areas, and that are still on sale, will show one of the strongest rebounds in the REIT sector for the remainder of the year. Sticking to REITs with quality assets, in core markets, will provide the greatest amount of safety as an investment. Dream Office's low debt, high liquidity, and over 85% of their assets in Downtown Toronto, will be one of the great winners of 2021. The catalyst for Dream is anticipated to be the August Buybacks. However, other speculation regarding a potential move by Sandpiper/Artis may occur. But that is simply speculation at this point. \n\n  \nH&amp;R REIT is another REIT I believe will continue its upward trend. H&amp;R's assets are 39% Office Weighted. Of that, H&amp;R's office portfolio is basically 100% leased (99.6%), a 12 year average lease term, and over 85% of their office tenants are investment grade credit rated tenants. One of the most defensive office portfolio's in North America. The catalyst for H&amp;R is expected to be their Spin Off of their divisions into multiple new REITs. One for each asset class. The announcement is anticipated in about 2 weeks, during their Q1 earnings report.  \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------\n\n  \n**Additional information/Facts:**  \n\n\n  \n\\- Downtown Toronto is 85% of all of Dream's Assets. Those assets can be walked, in a 1 hour walking tour. These assets are highly desired, and extremely difficult to aquire.  \n\\- NAV is expected to continue to rise as in place rents in the low 20s are replaced with market rents $40-50. This is significant organic growth that will drive Dream's NAV over the next 5 years with minimal capital expenditures.  \n\\- New buildings require around $80/foot leases to be worth investment for building. As older buildings in Toronto are removed in favor of new developments, this leaves less competition in Dream's renovated $40-$50/foot offerings.  \n\\- Dream has been reconfiguring their buildings to be single floor space offerings around 5,000-10,000 square feet. This allows businesses to rent a full floor all to themselves. This is highly desired and commands higher rent per foot. This is also a fairly unique offering differentiating Dream's Collection from other buildings.  \n\\- Dream is one of, if not the largest building owner in the downtown financial district  \n\\- Significant developments are planned for the future which is expected to nearly double GLA, without needing to aquire more land. 2200 Eglinton (3 Million GLA), 212-220 King (1.1 Million GLA, 50% ownership), and 250 Dundass (500 Thousand GLA) are some major potential projects.  \n\\- Debt in Dream Office is conservatively at \\~40% debt to assets  \n\\- Michael Cooper has the majority of his personal holdings in Dream Office REIT.   \n\n\n\\--------------------  \n\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n  \nLike always, this is not investment advice.

        "selftext": "Ok. I (and everyone here by now) knows that these are relatively small drops and understandable after such a historic bull market. But a lot of us just started investing in February after meme stocks got us interested. And a lot of people here and elsewhere said \"time in the market beats timing the market.\" So we, not knowing what we were doing, invested at the top. And now, when the market is going down, we're going red. Because, unlike many of you, we didn't get all the massive gains. So you're going from +50% to +40% and we're going -10% to -20%.\n\nI'm not trying to say we're blameless- I definitely put in too much money to start off with when I didn't know what I was doing \\[not even on memes, just bought high valuations\\]. Not trying to absolve responsibility here. But also, I do think the smug attitudes and \"wHaT ArE YoU GUyS InVEStEd In?!\" is a bit much. We get it. We made some mistakes. I, at least, even appreciate the warnings about planning how we'd feel if it drops a lot more and what we'll do. But I also think it's ok to feel scared and sad about losing money without getting so much attitude.",

        "selftext": "Hi Guys,\n\nI moved to Canada (ontario) from Dubai 3 years back and feel I've moved to  another planet. Living there a tax free life I never invested in anything except buying a house for myself and spending the rest of the money lavishly. I never had any loans but because I had a good salary (I was a first officer in an airline) I could afford to do that. The first time I filed my tax returns ever in Canada 2 years back and after having a conversation with my accountant I realized I was doing it all wrong. I started reading and it got me genuinely interested in investing (stocks, crypto,forex everything). after reading about gamestop I made an account with redditt and this is one of the only two communities im part of and I love it.\n\nNow im 42 living in Toronto which  married with a baby. I discontinued my flying and bought a small convenience store which did well initially but is kinda shut due to the ongoing lockdown. I have no loans not even credit card, my business is fully paid of and I have around 40000cad that I really wanna invest but to be honest im scared because I have expenses every month (my wife is a stay at home mother) please help and guide me to make the right move..\n\nThank you in advance",

        "selftext": "TLDR: **Long July corn** (futures preferred) although any ETF with exposure to cash corn would be best. I'm sorry if you can't trade futures. The next contract in September would not be preferred since that's the start of the harvest which usually runs into November. \n\nIf you have been watching the news, expensive agriculture has been nothing new in the past month. That shouldn't be too worrying, since the May Corn which set a high at $7.40/bsh was due to lack of old-stored stock because no one planted that much or thought to store that much during the recession. This is kinda like the opposite of the negative oil prices last year when there was 0 demand and full storage, because right not there is quite brisk demand (not from food, but ethanol producers) and almost all empty grain stores. July corn should also face the exact same problem, possibly worse as fertilizer prices are climbing and a few other factors detailed below. \n\n**Ethanol Demand**: Who uses the most corn? Nope, not farmers for feed or your fat wife but ethanol producers. What happens to all that ethanol? Except for some good ol' states like Oklahoma which sells mostly 100% pure American anticommunist gasoline, the ethanol is used for fuel. A quick google search will yield [articles reporting that fuel demand for end of March has surpassed levels set during 2020](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-products-gasoline/u-s-gasoline-demand-exceeds-2020-levels-for-first-time-in-2021-opis-idUSKBN2BM1UR). Americans are driving/traveling again as more and more of us are getting vaccinated, simply don't care, or are forced to commute back to the office. This will result in continued high demand for gasoline, and thus ethanol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smk6hcb45zw61.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2f11d0df5ce0709bd39995039d06ec8a4e54e15\n\n**Lack of Supply**: This is the critical part that resulted in May Corn's sharp rise. Supply as of right now might not be getting better, and thus should also play into July Corn's pricing. These are largely weather based, but starting with...\n\n**Corn Stocks are still trending down**: If you've ever watched Trading Places and wondered if you can make a killing on the crop report, here's your chance. This is the March 2021 grains report, and the headline is that [Corn stocks are -3% from 2020](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/xg94hp534/db78v700p/7p88db273/grst0321.pdf). But this doesn't show the trend. Flip to page 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2020-2021](https://preview.redd.it/bsx7kvo07zw61.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac918dfe02b84bf46afcbaedff22008d2ceeae1)\n\nEssentially all the 2020 harvest should be accounted for in December 2020 (harvest for corn is usually Sept - Nov). The demand is almost 250 million bushels more than the similar timeframe from last year. Also remember when looking at the March 2020 data below, that is when gasoline demand and food demand dropped through the floor. We're not going to get any new corn until September, so this summer of relying on what we have still in storage is going to get tight. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whrhpl4e8zw61.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1c85216ec9a6834a0cf5fb211fc897714b8656b\n\n**Weather pt1 Droughts**: Even though weather this summer won't affect July corn which should already be in storage, inclement weather might force users to bring forward their deliveries, because they won't be sure if their September/December stocks will even be there. Right now, the midwest is starting to see[signs of a drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) (if you're going to trade this, this site has to become your new bookmarked page). A look at the historical patterns, and you can see more and more of the midwest is [facing inclement drought conditions](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?Midwest). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/681ap0bg9zw61.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a320d905223497a3108bf3d1081946112adf5c70\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4qqafns9zw61.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=965ce52f6b5c8fc429e47142af571f12d42b3923\n\n**Weather pt2 Odd Weather Patterns**: Now I haven't read any scholarly articles for this, but doesn't it seem weather is odd this year for most of the country? First the [big winds from last year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2020_Midwest_derecho), then the early 2021 [big polar vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2021_North_American_cold_wave) that made a big V shape, and then sudden warming we're seeing now. I won't be so shocked if some big storm happens this summer to affect the heartland. Corn is very susceptible to storms because the roots are really shallow. \n\n**Weather pt3 Stress**: In any case, the weather so far might be leading to stressed corn. I have some BS11 planted in the middle of Texas, and it's already tasseling without any ears. This may be due to heat and drought conditions, but in any case I've heard farmers' horror stories of having their entire acreage sold for sileage because not one ear grew. Here's a pic of mine. The corn is about 4ft tall right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9sgyn7bbzw61.jpg?width=2976&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=476caf52a3d8542e8e2048d5e456102d12f9a80d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**High input costs**: This shouldn't color you shocked, but there's a [fertilizer shortage](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/fertilizer-shortage-ken-ferrie-weighs-fertilizer-issues-spring) going on too. You gotta use that and pesticides. I'm not sure if farmers have calculated this, but there's about at 20% increase in prices. Naturally I hope this means they're not willing to hedge their prices at a lower level (selling into the market), further helping prices go higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other considerations**: Corn is an international crop, but most of it is in the US. Brazil and Ukraine should have good planting, but once again that shouldn't affect July because of the supply/demand imbalance. There's also something about a locust infestation in Indiana. But, [plantings are increasing at a brisk pace](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/corn-planting-progress-leaps-29-points-beats-2020s-historic-jump). That might be why prices dropped today which I bought into. \n\nThese are my positions. I look forward to keep buying 2-5 contracts at a time and holding towards expiration in 57 days. \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6cp4h3ybzw61.jpg?width=719&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1c4e2054c36a9b4c1b0a7a2f10cbe5f96ed411c",

        "selftext": "I read today that if a stock is trading at 20.04 and pays a .4 dividend, on ex-dividend day the stock will adjust down to 20.00 to reflect that dividend no longer being available to buyers. \n\nI got down voted to hell for saying it's not necessarily 1:1 like that, but actually now I'm just confused.  Is it actually 1:1 like that?  Does the stock price adjust down automatically by that exact amount? I was under the impression that prices were only affected by supply and demand.  What about open limit orders?  Do they automatically adjust down by that exact that moment? I saw this somewhere. \n\nOr is it 100% due to market forces?  Since investors know they are no longer entitled to that money on ex-dividend day, they will naturally be willing to pay .4 less for the stock, thus they adjust their bid sizes accordingly. \n\nThe info I'm finding online is not clear on it.  Some sources are saying it's automatic, some are saying it's market forces (or maybe I'm just being thick)  Anyway, sorry for spreading misinformation in the other thread, but it would be cool if someone could actually clarify how this works.",

        "selftext": "So, recently I've been seeing more and more people saying that they're sitting on cash, which has got me thinking for a while. If everyone is waiting for a drop, it will most likely never come. Now I want to explain myself on why I think this, feel free to critique it. Suppose you, and 10 others are sitting out of the market, waiting for a correction. Now you don't know these people, but you all have the same intentions. Buy when there's a big enough sale. \n\nFirst question you should be asking yourself is what you consider a sale. With this in mind, would the others consider a sale to be above or below your price? If the answer is below, then what's to stop the other 10 from buying out the bottom, leaving you with your dick in your hand? This is on a small scale, but in reality, there's a lot more people, many of which are holding a lot of cash. On the other hand, suppose you think your price is above the estimates of others. Now the other 10 people are not idiots. They are probably thinking the exact same way you are, so if they move that limit buy up, suddenly you've reached the same conclusion as scenario 1.\n\nYou see, the issue I have with holding a lot of cash on the side is that you're holding a deprecating asset, in that your money is worth less with inflation. Why not put it in gold for example if you're worried about the market. \nAnother issue I've seen is that a lot of people can't put a number to what they'd consider a sale. We have seen a couple pullbacks in this past year where buying would've been very advantageous, and yet a lot of people still sit with cash. For example, there was early November. We had March gone by. I'm sure there were also pullbacks along the way that offered nice entry points, all of which were missed by many. What's to say that you manage to get in at the next sale? What if you miss the next sale by setting a price too low? Will you still be sitting on that cash in 2 years time? There's a reason people say you can't time the market. \nIf you really think you can get in at a cheaper price, why not buy 1 share now, and set up a scaletrader to buy 1 share in equal increments until it reaches that point? Worst case scenario, you get 1 share, and have to either wait, or buy in at the added premium. Best case scenario, your prediction was right, and you've now bought all the way down in equal increments, putting your DCA somewhere between the top and bottom. Sitting on cash however is probably not the best thing you can do though.",

        "selftext": "Hello my fellow apes, before I start, I wanted to say thank you so much for the love and support on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1so1m/quick_ta_dd_on_clov_as_of_42921/)! I didn't know that it would garner that much of positive feedbacks and I'm excited to write my TA posts as a series if time allows me to.\n\nWith that being said, I do not plan to write these kind of posts for every trading session days since I would run out of things to say at one point. My intention is to write these kind of posts for days where we see a significant gap-up or gap-down that reinforces the Elliott Wave Theory speculation. I also want to remind you that if the closing price goes below the speculated \"bottom\", the entire theory will be invalidated. I hope you all join me in this bumpy ride and enjoy it together. Anyways, let's get right to what I think about Friday's (4/30/21) price action.\n\n# Brief Summary:\n\nAs of 4/30/21, CLOV opened at $9.89 and closed at $9.85 with a previous closing price of $10.17 (-3.15%). To simply put it, today was a consolidation day based on the opening price and the closing price. The volume didn't help with the stock's bullish sentiment either as Friday's volume was at 17.38 mil in contrast to Thursday's volume at 68.33 mil. This means Friday's volume was cut down by more than -74.5%; that's 3/4 of Thursday's total volume, gone for today. Now, I have a few speculations as to why we experienced one of the lowest volumes on Friday ever since the CLOV hype began:\n\n* Continual market beatdown against smaller market caps causing a FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) against retail investors which discouraged investors from purchasing stocks due to the fear of further market beatdown.\n* CLOV's chart on Friday EXACTLY mirrored the NASDAQ 100 chart and NASDAQ's relative volume was the LOWEST out of all three major stock market indices (DOW, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P 500). Don't believe it? Check out the images below.\n   * Based on the images below, it's clear to me that there is a positive correlation to the performance of market index versus CLOV (individual stock) on Friday. This leads to a reasonable assumption that CLOV had a disappointing day NOT because of CLOV's getting \"dumped on\" per se, but rather because the entire market (especially NASDAQ) performed poorly on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CLOV's 5 min chart on Friday \\(4\\/30\\/21\\)](https://preview.redd.it/80g8hbo7tqw61.png?width=1825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272a07536e32b9477b8680c72063d3a5fd8141c6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NASDAQ's 1 hr chart for Friday](https://preview.redd.it/7vnsw2p9tqw61.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6485b2f802ade83939f2f423f2b88891d551e689)\n\n# Daily Chart:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Revised daily chart for CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/dbu0mj4mtqw61.png?width=2103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac30561676da97c754b0c5234956090ae9bd891d)\n\n**Fibonacci retracements:**\n\nWith Friday's bearish price action, it's good to see that we've respected the 23.6% level as a major support rather than letting it become the new resistance level. However, Friday's price action doesn't **necessarily** indicate that Thursday's (4/29/21) price action was a bear trap. Depending on the next Monday's overall market performance, volume level, and buying pressure, I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23.6% level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend. Overall, I do think that we will see 23.6% level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday.\n\n**Elliott Wave Theory:**\n\nFriday's price action, although it was a minimal dip in the grand scheme of things, does confirm that we are in wave 2 which is a corrective wave. I originally speculated that we will see a healthy pullback to around $8.52 range but since the chart respected the 23.6% level as a support, we may see a bounce earlier and perhaps move on to wave 3. That's a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars. But, of course, this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure. We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Friday's (5 min) Chart:\n\n[Friday's \\(5 min\\) chart](https://preview.redd.it/77zk7810uqw61.png?width=1824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aee8685305104aea32ca0c18b808d01ecb4c23ac)\n\n**VWAP:**\n\nToday, I wanted to focus more on the VWAP which is an acronym for 'volume weighted average price'. Simply put, it's a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day's volume and share price. The rule of this metric is: **If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line, it's a bullish sentiment and vice versa.**\n\nBased on that rule, we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what's going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue. Looking at the chart, we can see that during the market opening, we stayed **above** the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level. This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume. However, as the trading session went on, the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off. And as the volume level went down, you can see how the candle sticks moved **below** the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure.\n\n**RSI:**\n\nThis is further reinforced by looking at Friday's RSI chart. You can see that during the market opening, RSI trended towards an overbought territory, but as volume level died off RSI eventually corrected itself down to a neutral level, consolidated a bit, and headed over to an oversold level which is correlated to the 5 min price chart above. Based on VWAP and RSI analysis, it is reasonable to assume that CLOV will show a reversal as long as the volume level is high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short Interest:\n\n[Fintel's short volume data for CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/9mz2m7hxuqw61.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fecd758ddaab8e007c3ad0cde2034f6dbac7a71)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fintel's short volume data on GME](https://preview.redd.it/ygcg2dozuqw61.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae003665fe6a2c47d55848cb408325111c1880e2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fintel's short volume data on AMC](https://preview.redd.it/axn54td1vqw61.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87347195aeb549ac565c0d299172340878e26eb0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CLOV's stock price history](https://preview.redd.it/7rkeq9x2vqw61.png?width=1470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74aacd60997173485700b1069fba9c1555a4493f)\n\n**Short Volume:**\n\nLet's take a look at CLOV's short volume as a bonus since people believe there's a potential for short squeeze. According to a quick Google search, it is widely accepted as a fact that 10% short interest ratio is considered 'high' while 20% short interest ratio is considered 'extremely high'. Now take a look at all three of the short volume data on popular stocks like AMC, GME, and then CLOV. And now, take a look at CLOV's stock price history chart with its volume for each trading session days, what do you see?\n\nIt's clear to me as day that shorts are shorting in PROPORTION to the amount of volume level for each trading session day. Whether that day's volume level is extremely high or not, they are shorting CLOV with an average shorting ratio percentage of 23.1% which is considered EXTREMELY HIGH from 4/19 to 4/30. To further add, we can see that short volume ratio is pretty much similar across all three stocks. Based on that analysis, I will let you be the judge on whether we have a potential for short squeeze or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, CLOV's share price did NOT necessarily drop on Friday because people are \"dumping\" their shares. We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV's share price on Friday because of market's poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level. This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20%. **But,** we shouldn't invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone. We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company's management.\n\nThat being said, with 2 days of bearish days for the overall market, I hope to see a green day for the market on Monday and see CLOV bounce off from the $9.66 support. Thank you for reading and I look forward to throwing a champagne party with you all once we are at the moon!\n\n**Tl;dr:** **Today's low volume can be explained by the overall market performance, so don't worry too much about the price action today. BUY and HODL and watch this four petal leaf company go off to the moon with me.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is not a financial advice. I'm simply a fellow ape who just likes the company. Invest at your own risk and most importantly, do your own personal due diligence to ensure that the facts are true.",

        "selftext": "Alright, the weekends now over but that doesn't matter for most of you since Wendy's never closes and you need to work overtime to keep losing it on Robinhood with stupid FD's. Reading this won't take long and you can go back to using your lunch breaks to give discounted blowjobs next to the dumpster to support your \"grind.\"\n\nI am here to talk about my two favorite plays at the moment which you've either forgotten since reading it in the post title or you're just too retarded to know the tickers. It's fucking Academy Sports and Clean energy. If you just spat out your fresh semen and crayon lunch then pop an Adderall and try to decipher the symbols on your screen that make up the English alphabet. If you need help download a synthetic voice text-to-speech program and have it read to you. If that still doesn't work, you are actually retarded and should go seek immediate help. Clip your helmets chin strap and text your wife's boyfriend to come pick her up this time so you don't get distracted by the moaning and macaroni noises in the bedroom.\n\nFirst one, Academy Sports. Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven't stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors. You'd just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your \"girlfriend\" even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation, she can even smell it with her mask on. It's okay because your card is going to be declined and you'll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader.\n\nAcademy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain. We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it's been a total shit show. Academy reported earnings on March 30th and somehow, these motherfuckers blew the roof off.\n\n \u2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16.1%\n\n \u2022 Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019\n\n \u2022 Full Year Net Income Increased 157.2% over 2019 to $308.8 million\n\nHow did they do it? I have no fucking clue. Their e-commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60.7%. Where the fuck did this demand come from? Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard's gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn, and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead, eyes wide open. (Makes no sense, you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you \"watched a lot of kids\") Anyways, here's an excerpt.\n\n\"While many of our categories benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel, team sports equipment, apparel and footwear and back-to-school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year. In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth, they are all margin rate-accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales. Fourth, we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages, but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand. This year, we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line.\n\nAs we begin 2021, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team, the continued development of our key initiatives, and the stronger, deeper relationships we have built with our customers. The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021. Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2% to down 2%. This is an 18% to 14% increase on a two year stacked basis.\"\n\nOkay great, so people bought a lot of workout equipment. Who cares? What you semen suckers fail to understand, is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids. Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can fuck on the kitchen table again. Ding ding, those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind. Yes wow, vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins. Enter every single recreational sport available. Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see (this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it) we are obviously going into outdoor season. That means camping, vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do. Academy Sports has it all. Tents, grills, coolers, clothing, swimsuits, fishing gear, canoes, sleeping bags. Do me a favor, walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself.\n\nI obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one. Show me another stock with a 100% buy rating and if you're too lazy, type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself. Now I'm going to get into the most interesting part. ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts. blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet. It's kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support. ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago. If I had a guess, it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn't deserve to be, and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it. Oops, it's too late now.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16%. Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33.62% and a PE ratio of 8. Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room. What could these large funds know that we don't? Hmmm.. let's try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer. (Does this remind you of anything else?) I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is 40,436,703 shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short. That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so. Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself. To me, it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation. (Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from $32 to $35. If you're comparing companies in the same sector, who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on? Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019, 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio, or Dick's with 445M in 2019, 409M in 2020, or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former?\n\nI already know you little asshats get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it's up 150% for the week, but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3% for the week and up 10% for the month.\n\nI do also want to give some credit to /u/XionTG for the predictions below that he made a month ago. They turned out to be spot on, even though he got a lot of flack in the comments.\n\nPredictions:\n\nMy Target Prices\n\nFirst short-term target price: $30 by 5/1\n\nSecond short-term target price: $60 by 7/1\n\n\u200b\n\n(You can see his original DD here but I will warn you degenerate retards that this DD is from the r-investing crowd so don't pucker your asshole up too tight or your heads might explode and your balls could drop).\n\n\u200b\n\nNext one, CLNE (Clean Energy)\n\n\"Clean Energy is changing the way the world fuels its vehicles. Reducing pollution from the transportation industry is an important goal for our nation, and we at Clean Energy know just how realistic and attainable that goal is with natural gas fuel.\n\nMoving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer, healthier planet for all of us. This change is happening. Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world.\"\n\nHmmm, I can't even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time (notably marked by unprecedented climate change) when a company providing an alternative to diesel, especially one that is clean and readily available, could POSSIBLY flourish. I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over $500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day. Looking over the finances, fuel prices accounted for 20% more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis. Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business. We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry. Not that this is entirely related, but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again, exceeded expectations. Amazon's sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent. Why does it matter? Shut the fuck up and keep reading. \"[Clean Energy] signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas, as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations.\" Yeah you read that correctly, Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor. It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend showed up with a bottle of lube and his extra thick cock ring.\n\nAlso noteworthy.\n\n\"UPS Makes Largest Purchase of Renewable Natural Gas Ever in the U.S.\n\nSeven-Year 170 Million Gallon Equivalents Purchase from Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Will Reduce GHG Emissions by More than 1 Million Metric Tons.\" Go look at their press releases if you want to see their other partnerships.\n\nI have attached another DD done by /u/twenty98 about CLNE that was well done. We also know that /u/NrdRage made a very good DD as well so go read it because I'm not going to retype it and in any way attempt to take credit for their work. I am not sitting here saying I love the stock, to be honest, I love the company and what it does. Reducing emissions in one of the industries with an oversized carbon footprint is a home run for me. Just as Tesla and electric vehicles are the future, alternative fuels will fill the gaps where batteries cannot support. \n\nI don't really care what you spray paint huffing STD riddled idiots do, but in my opinion, both of these companies look like they have more potential than the current share price is demonstrating. CLNE is up 5% for the week and down 22% for the month. For those that figured out MVIS, CLOV and all the other bullshit, the time to buy into something isn't after it's up 120% in two days and Cramer mentions it. Find assets at a less retarded entry point. Good luck and go back to whatever smooth brained moron shit you were doing before seeing this.\n\n\u200b\n\nThat's the end of the post and that's all I got for you. Now you can return to the act of holding your wife's hair while she goes down on your neighbor! Thank me later.",

        "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-week-ahead-blow-out-us-earnings-suggest-market-has-room-run-2021-04-30/\n\nArticle for those who want to scroll through quickly:\n\nU.S. companies are leaping above expectations on first-quarter earnings, giving investors stronger confirmation that profit growth will be able to support the market this year.\n\nA big piece of that growth is coming once again from technology and growth companies, which suggests greater durability in companies that underperformed more economically focused value names for months.\n\nEarnings are rebounding from last year's pandemic-fueled lows. With results in from more than half of the S&amp;P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nAbout 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.\n\nSome strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 (.SPX) is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data.\n\n\"The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that's because you're seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there's still more room,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\n\nThe high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year.\n\nCiting stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&amp;P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&amp;P 500 index (.SPX) was last at about 4,180.\n\nStocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.\n\nEarnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.\n\nHowever, \"tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That's what I find amazing,\" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.\n\n\"Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,\" he said.\n\nInvestors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), Cummins Inc (CMI.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).\n\nThe first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.\n\nValue has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index (.RLV) remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index (.RLG) is up about 8% in that time.\n\nTechnology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&amp;P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv's data.\n\nTech (.SPLRCT) is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.\n\nWhile the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.\n\n\"It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,\" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.\n\n\"We're actually carving out a third group ... defensives,\" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now. \n\nIts hard to find a bearish view on the current market situation when so many companies are beating earnings. Maybe in the short term we'll see some volatility as we finish getting through earnings season, but I don't think we'll see much more falling, if any.",

AOL at peak had a $200 billion market cap.\n\nYahoo was the market leader in internet search traffic, it had the top talent and was the premier online destination, and had a who's who of fortune 500 clients buying ads. AOL was a behemoth generating massive amounts of revenue and profit from internet users.\n\nIt was estimated in 1999 that 50% of all US home internet users were AOL customers. \n\nBy 2016 Verizon had acquired both companies in separate transactions for about 9 billion dollars.

        "selftext": "Hey all - since there are a number of OTC stocks in this sub with \"uplisting\" as a key catalyst, I decided to look into the actual returns. I compiled the list of uplistings since 2014 (didn't go further back due to lack of time... takes forever to compile) and ended up with a list of over 500 stocks that gone from OTC to NASDAQ or NYSE. Jumping straight to the conclusions and observations:\n\nIt looks like 2021 could be a blockbuster year for uplistings. There are 37 stocks that uplisted thus far, and if you annualized this figure, it'll be over 100 uplistings this year, much greater than the 40-70 stocks typically. This bodes well for uplisting plays.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axokv9xesww61.png?width=1126&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b16043d26cced1638438a78e84987322296b175\n\nNasdaq Capital Markets is also by far the destination of choice for uplisting, due to their easiest listing requirements.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bm2c09xesww61.png?width=1159&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9f967ff4d4d1259d9fc54e81956329a907876f3\n\nBy market cap at the time of listing, it seems like USD400m is the sweet spot. The NASDAQ Capital Market is the best bet for small and micro caps...\n\nNow the key takeaway is this: if you buy a stock on the day of the uplisting and hold for 12 months, on average, you'd get a 34% return. Not bad considering the markets grow at 7% per year on average.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5zoadxesww61.png?width=1189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=042135a44d99ab7992e7d111822f7afb0705754e\n\nHowever, if you get in earlier, and buy 6 months before the actual uplisting date, and then hold for another 12 months after uplisting, the average return balloons to 185%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0yw2xzesww61.png?width=1153&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5797339b50674412857786dc145453e742b563b\n\nHealth Care stocks tends to want to uplist the most since they are most in need of cash. By sector, five sector stands out: consumer staples, communication services, consumer discretionary, technology and health care. Each of these sectors returned over 200% on average after 18 months, so these are the sectors to focus on if you're looking to play this strategy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5b97ucxesww61.png?width=1515&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c1d57b6d1879996ef7f692d2a28583e90e111d\n\nFinally, if you're wondering what stocks have the potential to uplist, I've compiled a list here. All of the companies in the list have said publicly in the past that they intend to uplist as soon as practicable. Basically all US cannabis stocks are candidates, including some Canadian retailers who have already applied like High Tide ($HITIF) and Fire &amp; Flower ($FLLWF). Another r/pennystocks favorite is on the list... $ABML.\n\nI discuss this topic in more detail in my video but I cannot post the link here. Search for it if you're interested in learning more!",

        "selftext": "\nBackstory - Got into investing at the start of the year. Rode the gamestop train and was immensly annoyed at the manipulation taking place on it. Got out for a \u00a35k profit.\n\nGot back on the gamestop train and am sitting at a \u00a3200 loss.\n\nGot onto the meme train of a certain stock running this week that deals with Lidar tech. Had 5k profit, was too greedy, got tied up and couldnt check my profile, ended up with a 2k loss.\n\nI really struggle with taking profits. It's probably greed. This is the biggest part of my investing life that I need to work on. I always think \"hmmm 20% profit, thats good, but 25% is better\". This mindset screws me every time, to the point I end up taking a loss, or taking a tiny profit because I held on and lost the big profit.\n\nOn the back of this week, I threw a yolo at Amazon 2 hours before earnings and made about \u00a3600 with an \u00a318,000 play. Sold the next day.\n\nNow, this next thing is what really pissed me off - When I first started investing, I wanted to do my own DD.\n\nI found a British company called Scirocco Energy. It was a pennystock, trading around the $1 mark, but they had a couple of things I liked. Some mining operations set up for a few years down the line, and it looked pretty slick with some reasonable figures. It was my very first investment, and I put about \u00a330 in, just so I could say I was \"in the market\".\n\nIt traded sideways FOREVER. Until all of a sudden, the other day, it went skyward, 60% in a single day, On no news at all. it was obvious it was being pumped and dumped. I sold and took my tiny $16 profit.\n\nIt irked me though. Someone has found this stock, pumped it up to high heaven and is in the process of dumping it. There's zero regulation. Nobody gives a toss. Nobody cares.\n\nLook at gamestop. Brokers literally turned off the market for a couple of days and caused retail a world of pain.\n\nThe mavis was another glorified pumped up memestock.\n\nIt just stinks.\n\nSo, I'm kinda done with this short term investing.\n\nI'm looking for a long term investment, something I can throw that \u00a318,000 back in and do a Buffet on it. Leave it for a year or two and see what happens. Something which is only gonna go up, even if it is at a very slow rate. Low risk, low reward is fine by me, because my anxiety can't take any more of the huge changes in price on meme stocks.\n\nSuggestions anyone? Stick it all back in amazon? Microsoft? Some ETF that i'm unaware of? Maybe even BRK.B?\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as salty ranting tears because I lost money, in reality, my \u00a330k profile has probably broken even (maybe a tiny loss) since I started investing, but it's really opened my eyes to how it all works, and how much of a casino it all is.\n\nI've got a couple of meme-ish long positions which hopefully might come good this year, but I need some stability in my life.",

        "selftext": "When searching for a company to do a DD on this week for this Discord, I initially was struggling to land on a company. There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn\u2019t know where to start. Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands, ticker $HBI, due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn\u2019t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday, so I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked. However, this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning. Funnily enough, it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America's first, largest, and objectively best waste management company, $WM. This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view $WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20+ years, including some basic financial information, how WM can grow into the future, as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see. Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written, weed induced WM DD, I hope you enjoy.\n\nThe aptly named Waste Management, ticker symbol $WM, is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover-advantage specializing in the waste management sub-sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years. Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection, landfill operations, waste transportation, and finally, recycling. It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow $WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1.68% with a yearly dividend of $2.30 paid out quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53% which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable. In fact, it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends.com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be (between 40-50% according to their 2020 Investors day presentation.) In addition to being very sustainable, a payout ratio of 53% also leaves room for growth, and $WM has been doing just that. While it's 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1.98% compared to todays at 1.68% the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41.46% over the last 5 years, 28.24% over the last 3 years, and even in the shitstorm that was 2020, WM raised its dividend by 6.34% just showing that this company not only cares about it's dividend growth, but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years (since 2004) of consistent dividend increases, the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged, maintaining managements preferred 40-50% payout ratio  with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world. Finally, Waste Management has a Current Price of \u2245 $138, an analyst price range of $125-$160, and an average analyst price target of $144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction. \n\nMoving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns, $WM has a current P/E ratio of 37.7 and I know this might seem very high, it actually isn't when you compare it to other waste management companies. For instance, WM\u2019s next three largest competitors are Republic Services, with a P/E of 35.2, Clean Harbor, with a P/E of 36.7, and Waste Connections, which has a huge P/E of 141.13 (this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes, it really is that big...) As you can see, a P/E ratio in the low to mid 30\u2019s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub-sector. Just as the P/E ratio comes with the sub-sector; growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its +1, and this is the next aspect of $WM\u2019s balance sheet that I want to touch on. In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company, it officially made enough to fully pay down it's yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt, an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 (and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments). Regardless, this is still an important feat as it shows that $WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend, but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future. Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on? Well in 2020 (yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses) $WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional $7.8 Billion in long term debt as well, just showing the strength of it's balance sheet and how the acquisitions it's made are paying off in time.\n\nFinally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better, more complete light. The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it's unusually high P/B ratio of 7.7ish. While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector, it is still important to compare it to its peers. The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P/B ratios than $WM. Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value, this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019, seeing that it could pay off all it's short term debt, Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions, one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4.6 Billion. This higher P/B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating. However my response to this information is just this: If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years, isn\u2019t it better to open your position early, accrue dividends and price appreciation, while buying dips, than to just wait for its P/B ratio to dip down to a level you\u2019re more comfortable with? Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves, so too will the P/B ratio fall.\n\nMoving on from financials and more towards hard assets, Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first-mover advantage in its respective sub-sector. The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States, Canada, DC, and Puerto Rico. $WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill. They also have 346 waste transfer/consolidation stations, 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation , 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23,000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW/hour of electrical/steam energy, enough to power 660,000 homes. Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online. This is enough RNG to power 1/3 of their 26,000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460,000 homes. Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn't a special waste-to-energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas-to-energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180,000 homes per year, bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1.3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years.\n\nThe last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P/B ratio the company currently has. Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to. In addition to being the largest, the first, and objectively the best waste management company, $WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG\u2019s that are simply by-products of their primary business.  In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands, $WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply. Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it's payment model, a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn\u2019t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste $WM picks up, and is changing to a fee-for-service model which will take into account everything from pick-up to transport, to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy. This move will essentially turn every action $WM takes into a way to make money. By providing such an essential service that no-one is exempt from needing, $WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come. And that is no understatement, Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10+ years. The final aspect of $WM\u2019s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others, and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas. Yes there are competitors here, but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing, and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin, $WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come.\n\nOverall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly, with $WM I might get to retirement early, and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job, as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe, I think it's only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money.",

        "selftext": "Overview:  For those not aware CYDY, Cytodyn, is a start up biotech that has been developing a drug for more than 8 years.  Originally focused with HIV resistant strains, the company has made several direction changes looking into cancer, Covid, Host Versus Graft, and other applications.  It applied for an HIV BLA and received a Refusal To File from the FDA.  The company has developed a trend of shifting focus each time it approaches the moment of truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was nothing new in the TNBC, Triple Negative Breast Cancer, presentation.  \n\n\nI find it troubling that not only did Scott Kelly trot out stuff we already knew, but that the company has shifted focus to drug study still in Phase 1.  \n\n\nLet me drive that home. You have HIV yards from the finish line. You have COVID who's study needs to be redone and could be before October if the company actually cared to put the work in. Instead they are driving attention, effort and resources to a study that is the furthest from revenue.  \n\n\nIt actually fits a pattern. Remember that the primary focus was always HIV. But when COVID hit we shifted to it's use in COVID. At first we all moaned about it because it was a distraction. But it kind of made sense, and since this was the first time we shifted focus it wasn't a trend yet.  \n\n\nSo COVID was the big focus, HIV limped along. HIV got rejected and instead of curing the failures in the Refusal To File, the driving focus became COVID. Yes there was a pandemic, yes it was a hot topic of the market. But in terms of reaching revenue COVID was less tangible than getting HIV completed.  \n\n\nThen the COVID studies came out and they failed. Granted when they were started there was little known about COVID. But the studies themselves were flawed and not designed to separate out groups in favor of lumping them all together to drive a P value. When that didn't work out they tried to separate out the groups which looked awful to investors and the FDA to get that P value. More to the point CYDY shifted focus to long haulers.  \n\n\nSo now the company had shifted focus all over the place. As long haulers moved along slowly, redoing COVID looked expensive, and HIV stayed in limbo. The company shifted focus to cancer. The furthest back of all the studies. Furthest away from approval.  \n\n\nSo here is the pattern. Whenever the moment of truth comes CYDY makes an emergency shift to something that is further away from a definite answer. This is also known as shifting deck chairs on the Titanic or Hindenburg. Which ever catastrophe you prefer in an analogy about catastrophes. I would personally pick the Titanic because of the slow sinking the company has been doing since HIV.  \n\n\nYou can't justify to me why 50 million has been raised only for the company to focus efforts else where than achieving an approval where they are furthest along. You can't justify to me avoiding success and revenue producing activities in favor of concepts in development.  \n\n\nThere is a fundamental problem in management and there could be a fundamental problem with the drug. My hope is that's management and Nader is really that bad at what he does. But all this shifting around could also be explained by a drug that looks great on paper and poor in practice.  \n\n\nLet us not forget that Remedesivir was originally an Ebola drug that looked great on paper and clunked out in practice. It was replaced ironically by mono-clonal drugs and mothballed. Leronlimab maybe equally flawed for it's current tasks. Why else put off everything to correct the RTF? Why focus on projects further away from approval? Why only see success stories in EINDs where it seems to be universal and then no significance in actual studies?  \n\n\nIf the drug is not flawed in practice, then let's really dig into management. It falls to one big question: Why are you avoiding revenue producing outcomes? HIV secures the future of the company. It has been put on the back burner. The only thing I can chalk it up to is that there is some sort of malignant phycological problems at work with Nader that trickles down into the board.  \n\n\nThere is your thought experiment for the day. Stopping to ask why.  \n\n\nBounce in share **price** or not. This is still bound to drop lower until something fundamentally changes.",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 3) - $AMC, $ROKU, $SQ, $ETSY, $Z, $PTON, $RKT, $CRSR, $MT, and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 3 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI fucking love earnings season. It\u2019s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What\u2019s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they\u2019re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\n\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their \"true\" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.\n\n- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.\n\n- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.\n\n- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.\n\n- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin\u2019 companies, theres plenty that I\u2019ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I\u2019d love to see what you guys come up with.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there\u2019s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or comment and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, do you own research. \n\n**TL;DR \u2013 Some brokers are taking their sweet time with these shares. MOST companies are down day after a merger and then rebound in the coming weeks. Sit tight!**\n\nOk, so we\u2019ve all figured out what happens to our APHA and TLRY shares now that the merger is closed (Right? Right!). If you\u2019re still confused, check out [THIS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphria/comments/n3uylv/still_dont_know_what_is_happening_to_your_apha/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from earlier. \n\nFeedback on my prior post is that SOME brokers have changed your position to reflect your TLRY shares (TD Ameritrade for the win) and some have not (get your shit together, RH). Either way, you will get those shares (hopefully) soon and all will be well with the world.\n\nBUT WAIT! TLRY is down $1.20 today\u2026 WTF?!? \n\nA few things to note - There are a lot of market dynamics at play here:\n\n1. There were hedge funds with prior positions that now need to rebalance. \n\n2. There are people who were only holding on the APHA for the merger and now want to sell.\n\n3. There are ETFs that will likely have some sort of rebalancing.\n\n4. Shorts may be covering on the weakness today.\n\n5. This is a liquidity event \u2013 expect volatility.\n\nWe can expect a decent amount of choppiness around TLRY the next few days. \u201cBut grey\\_patagonia\\_vest how do you know?!?\u201d Well kids, I did some good old fashion data analysis. \n\nI pulled a list of all mergers with the following criteria:\n\n1. Both target and acquirer are publicly traded on a North American exchange\n\n2. The deal terms (like APHA/TLRY) were either all stock or at least some cash and some stonks\n\n3. Any mergers with an equity value &gt;$500mm USD (some of the smaller ones can get funky)\n\nI then looked at the performance of the acquirer (like TLRY in this case) \u2013 after the deal closed. I started with the stock price of the acquirer 30 trading days before the merger closed, then looked at 7 days before, one day before, one day after, one week after, one month after, three months after, six months after and finally a year after. Here is what I found\u2026. \n\nOf the 214 deals that fit this criteria\u2026 \\~56% of acquirer stocks were down the day after a merger closed (as measured from the day before), so TLRY is in good company. Of these 56%, the companies were down an AVERAGE of 3% (TLRY currently down \\~6%). Then, of those companies that were down on day one, 19% of them were back up after a week, 38% after a month and 48% after 3M. Those 48% that were up after 3M were up an average of 14% from the day before the merger. If TLRY behaved that way, we\u2019d see TLRY @ $20.90 before long. \n\nWhat does this mean for TLRY?

        "selftext": "Here's some charts that distribute the allocations of President Biden's $2T Infrastructure Plan or [**American Jobs Plan**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/). Dollar value is approximate.\n\nSince r/stocks doesn't allow images to be upload, you will have to see all my sub-par looking charts [here](https://imgur.com/a/yJF6dOH). \n\nMore details on how the American Jobs Plan...\n\n* [Empowers and Protects Workers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/23/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-empowers-and-protects-workers/)\n* [Support Women's Employment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/21/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-will-support-womens-employment/)\n* [Supports Veterans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-supports-veterans/)\n* [Supports Small Businesses](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/13/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-supports-small-businesses/)\n\n**Who is going to pay for this?**\n\nWe the people. Well more like we the 1%ers. And corporations. \n\nAgain, I made more [charts](https://imgur.com/a/zFFfyGJ) to visualize it a bit better. \n\nSo unless you're a high earner, this won't affect you (much). I made these charts about a week or two ago but I heard for the American Families Plan, individuals earning more than $452,700 and married couples earning more than $509,300 (meaning each partners could earn less than $400,000) could see a tax increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do you mean, \"won't affect you (much)\"?**\n\nIf there's tax increases for the rich, what will the rich do? They'll take their stock market gains before the tax increases. 2020 saw huge gains so we may see a correction in the coming months. How much of a correction you ask? I don't know but I would guess 10-15% in the broader market. More if you're into speculative high growth stocks. I say that because I know a lot of you have positions on them. Careful how you invest these next few months.\n\nAnd if there's tax increases for corporations, obviously they'll do whatever they can to avoid them. However even a 1% increase in their taxes (note below I mention that many corporations pay very little taxes because of loopholes) will affect their bottom line. This means earnings will be less and therefore lower stock valuations.\n\n**So if the rich sell and corporations are being taxed more, how will that affect the stock market?**\n\n1. Less incentive to invest due to more taxes. People will look to other investments or stay cash. (Seriously though, the tax plan won't make a huge difference unless you're a 1%er.)\n2. Bonds become more [favorable](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/taxes/government-bonds#:~:text=Income%20from%20bonds%20issued%20by%20state%2C%20city%2C%20and%20local%20governments,where%20the%20bond%20was%20issued). Income from bonds issued by state, city, and local governments (municipal bonds, or munis) is generally free from federal taxes. You will, however, have to report this income when filing your taxes. Examples: MUB, HYD, VOHIX, VWAHX.\n3. ETFs and Mutual funds are more favorable. They both are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on your earnings. ETFs, however, have an advantage over mutual funds due to three reasons: 1) 2018, 89% of ETFs were passive vs. 4% of mutual funds. Less trading involved with passive. 2) Any high dividend or high interest paying securities will receive more distributions, therefore a high tax bill. 3) ETFs have greater liquidity as they are traded during market hours vs. mutual funds are traded at the beginning and end of market sessions.\n\n\\*In 2018, Goldman Sachs did a study that showed 100% of their ETFs did not pay capital gains. Broadly, 90% of ETFs did not pay capital gains compared to 39% of mutual funds.\n\n4. Tax advantaged accounts like Roth IRA and 401K are more favorable. If you're one of the super rich, take a look at the [backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp). It's a way for super rich people to put money into retirement without the contribution limits. Roth IRA contribution limit is $6,000 per year. BUT if you make more than $140,000 as a single or $206,000 filing jointly as married then you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. The easiest way to get by this is converting a traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does history [say](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/tax-hikes-history#:~:text=In%20the%2013%20previous%20instances,the%20data%20in%20the%20calendar) about stock market performance after tax increases?\n\n\"In the 13 previous instances of tax increases just since 1950, the S&amp;P 500, the stock index that tracks most of the major companies in the US, has shown higher average returns, and higher odds of an advance, in times when taxes are increasing, according to Chisholm's research, which analyzed the data in the calendar year of the tax changes, plus the year prior and year after. This pattern holds true even when you drill down into key sectors of the S&amp;P 500.\" Here's a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/2MaBjOp.png) of the S&amp;P500 performance after tax increases. Not too bad eh?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What's happening now with the current tax law?**\n\n* 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal corporate taxes. Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton, and IBM are some of those companies. Corporate tax rate is currently 21%.\n* 56 Fortune 500 companies paid 0-5% on their 2018 income.\n* 2017 tax bill cut the average rate that corporations paid in half from 16 percent to less than 8 percent in 2018. I couldn't find any data on this but its due to loopholes in the tax system.\n\n**The Made in America Tax plan**\n\n* Will raise over $2 trillion over the next 15 years and more than pay for the mostly one-time investments in the American Jobs Plan and then reduce deficits on a permanent basis.\n* Increase corporate tax rate at 28% from 21%\n* Right now, the tax code rewards U.S. multinational corporations that shift profits and jobs overseas with a tax exemption for the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and the rest is taxed at half the domestic tax rate.\n* The proposal will increase the minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21 percent and calculate it on a country-by-country basis so it hits profits in tax havens. It will also eliminate the rule that allows U.S. companies to pay zero taxes on the first 10 percent of return when they locate investments in foreign countries.\n* The United States is now seeking a global agreement on a strong minimum tax through multilateral negotiations.\n* Invert the current law in which U.S. corporations can acquire or merge with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company, even though their place of management and operations are in the United States.\n* A proposal that companies can no longer write off expenses that come from offshoring jobs. Instead a tax credit will be proposed to support onshoring jobs.\n* Invert a Trump tax law for \u201cForeign Derived Intangible Income\u201d (FDII), which gave corporations a tax break for shifting assets abroad and is ineffective at encouraging corporations to invest in R&amp;D. Instead the revenue will be used to expand more effective R&amp;D investment incentives.\n* Enact a minimum tax of 15% on large corporations\u2019 book income.\n* Eliminate tax preferences (worth billions of dollars) for fossil fuels and make sure polluting industries pay for environmental clean up.\n* Increase enforcement for tax evasion. Typical workers\u2019 wages are reported to the IRS and their employer withholds, so they pay all the taxes they owe. By contrast, large corporations have at their disposal loopholes they exploit to avoid or evade tax liabilities, and an army of high-paid tax advisors and accountants who help them get away with this. At the same time, an under-funded IRS lacks the capacity to scrutinize these suspect tax maneuvers: A decade ago, essentially all large corporations were audited annually by the IRS; today, audit rates are less than 50 percent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So what should I do to prepare if this bill passes?**\n\nNothing different honestly. Keep investing. DCA - dollar cost average if your stocks drop. Stay the course in your high conviction names. De-risk if you have to by investing in safer investments like index funds or ETFs. I know a lot of you are into SPAX (special purpose acquisition companies. I spelled it this way in case this sub banned the real acronym) and other speculative companies. There's almost 500 of them out there. 217 of those were from 2020. To be honest, 1% of those companies will moon. Most of them won't see a return for years. Are you willing to hold them without knowing they will moon in 5-10 years? Some may not even make a return. Make sure you understand market conditions. Stocks really do go up but its only the ones that are backed by strong earnings and potential. Don't get burned. Money is not everything but it's a tool to bring you financial freedom sooner in life. You know what they say, \"there's only two things guaranteed in life: death and taxes\".",

        "selftext": "# PART 2 \u2013 Understanding Washington: The Timeline and Calendar of Cannabis Legislation (2021)\n\nAfter completing my [first piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/mvlfnc/understanding_washington_the_cannabis_road_map/) I was overwhelmed by the positive response and am glad to be able to help shed some light on the process inside the Legislature. Since then I\u2019ve had several conversations with colleagues and have decided to include further explanation to help the community understand how long this process may take. This is particular important in response to the idea that \u201conce Schumer drops the bill the stocks will take off\u201d \u2013 so I\u2019ll be including notes on how I predict the stock market will respond to certain pieces of news.\n\n*Disclaimer*: *In this note I will offer some personal predictions around stock movements related to legislative timelines. These ideas are not financial advice meant to encourage you to buy, sell or adjust your holdings in any particular way.* *They reflect a combination of my understanding of the market factors and legislative process.* *There are no crystal balls.*\n\n**Where we are today:** At the moment there is a House Bill (HR1966) that has been approved by the House and sent to the Senate. The Senate Banking committee has a sister bill (S.910) which Sen. Sherrod Brown has commented on in several ways. (1) It will not pass solo but only as part of a bigger bill, (2) He has also been quoted saying \u201cI\u2019m talking to Schumer. We\u2019re not clear what we\u2019re going to do there\u201d. I believe him when he says they don\u2019t know what they are going to do yet. No conspiracies here, they are simply working on the process to get this done.\n\nAdditionally we have a major comprehensive bill that Sen. Majority Leader Schumer continues to promote near daily: \n\n* \u201cI won\u2019t stop working to end the federal prohibition on marijuana and undo the harms of the War on Drugs\u201d. \u2013 May 1, 2021\n* \u201cHopefully, the next time this unofficial holiday, 4/20, rolls around, our country will have made progress in addressing the massive overcriminalization of marijuana\u201d April 20, 2021\n* \u201cAt some point we're going to move forward, period.\u201d April 3, 2021 (*regarding Biden\u2019s potential negativity).*\n\nQuotes such as the above go all the way back to January and remind me of few political moments. I\u2019ve been trying to understand why Sen. Schumer has pivoted so strongly to vocal support when most of the time (read: 99% of important legislation) is done quietly until necessary.  One that stands out was the push for the Affordable Care Act by President Obama. After failing to get a single Republican vote on HR1 (the American Reinvestment &amp; Recovery Act) the White House knew they needed to put pressure on Republicans to see if they could attract any support. This also served to create as strong of a public push on GOP members as possible to see if public comments could sway the members. \n\nIn the end it did not move any votes and ACA passed under reconciliation \u2013 however it shows us that the large scale use of the bully pulpit is not a typical political measure. If Schumer is doing this then he doing it for a reason. \n\nSchumer is making it clear to everyone in Washington that this bill is going to be pursued and promoted. He is making it clear that the White House does not matter (the White House would have told Schumer to stop talking so loudly and often if they could) and that in this particular case the Senate leads. This is not unheard of and, in fact, often times the Senate is the more important piece of the puzzle than the White House.\n\nRemember, President Biden can speak around the issue for the entirety of 2021 and then once something passes the Senate simply say that he will note \u201cgo against the will of the people\u201d and use moderated talking points. There is **no sense in supporting a nonexistent bill** so do not expect the White House to show anything but silence or limited restraint (at times confusingly so) until this gets to his desk.\n\n**The Legislative** [Calendar:](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/2021_schedule.htm) Senators and Congress members are the only people over the age of 9 who seem to get \u201crecess\u201d but these markers of time are going to be important for us to understand moving forward. First let\u2019s talk about their weeks:\n\n**The Week:** The typical legislative week begins on Monday evening where typically votes with unanimous consent (non-controversial) are ordered. These sessions often include bills naming post offices after famous Americans, and \u201c1 Minute\u201d speeches which are opportunities for members to get up and talk to their base on camera \u2013 which makes for great Youtube moments and campaign fundraiser emails. \n\nTuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are the days when real work occurs \u2013 this is when committees meet, hearings are held and floor votes (typically in the late afternoon or evening) take place. By Friday *most of the time* members are on flights back to their districts. Why the short work week? Well, Friday, Saturday and Sunday are for cutting ribbons and kissing babies. Not too long ago members would spend weekends in D.C. and spent more time getting to know their colleagues. This often, though not always, created bridges for compromise and discussion around issues and ideas. Part of the polarization of Washington is directly related to the first that members run campaigns 24/7 and are seldom able to actually do their jobs without rushing back to the district. But I digress\u2026\n\nThe weekly calendar matters because it shows how tight the timelines are for members of Congress. It\u2019s like getting a package in 8 business days vs. 8 calendar days \u2013 things get spread out. So when Schumer mentions \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d note that might only be 8-10 working days. This means if there are minor setbacks they can mean additional weeks, not days.\n\n**Recess:** Congress\u2019 calendar includes some extended periods of \u201cdistrict time\u201d referred to as recess. These are always the case so no one should be deterred by their mention. Congress takes the entire month of August off as well as typically a full week (or two) around each banking holiday. The calendar is set by the Majority party and recess is always subject to their gavel. Remember all those \u201cnear government shut downs\u201d in December that came with votes around Christmas? That\u2019s not *normal* per se, however their typical recess is being adjusted by the needs of legislation.\n\nCannabis legislation, no matter how near and dear to our hearts, will not be the cause of a recess delay or dismissal. We should expect any legislation to be following normal order. This means that if a Cannabis bill is introduced just before recess we need to expect an extended pause before future movement. This will undoubtedly affect share prices. *For those who expect introduction to lead to a direct increase in value I would strongly encourage you to consider the timelines discussed in this post.* *An introduction press release may lead to a quick 5%+ gain, but the following days and weeks may contain zero news or movement leads to potential for a glide back.* *This makes for great trading opportunities, but should not be seen as a clear indication of any rally or stable movement.*\n\n**The Calendar for 2021:** You can read through the tentative calendar here to get a sense of what we\u2019re looking at. Remember that members can write legislation, talk with each other, whip votes and take meetings with stakeholders at any time \u2013 *however \u2013* non legislative weeks are slower and less productive for movement in general.\n\n**May - 40% chance -** The Senate will be in session May 10 \u2013 28. For those counting that is 3 short working weeks during which time competing priorities will be on the Senate\u2019s minds as well (infrastructure, families bill and COVID). \\*\\*This is the first upcoming chance for Schumer to drop a piece of legislation. I believe there is around a 50/50 shot (I gave it 40%) we get legislation during this period. If we do get Comprehensive Cannabis Legislation during these 3 weeks I believe confidence is warranted. Again, noting the [PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/mvlfnc/understanding_washington_the_cannabis_road_map/) of this post, developing the final bill that can realize 50 or 60 votes is going to be very difficult. It\u2019s like playing Junga with a tower on a moving record player. To have moved from ideas to laws in 3 months while dealing with the other legislation, an impeachment trial, and the start of a new session would be nothing short of incredible. \n\nShould the bill be dropped in these three weeks it will be unceremoniously sent to the appropriate committee and things will hold for a bit. Do not expect action by that committee immediately. This is where an introduction stock bump might occur followed by a retracement when further action does not occur.\n\n**June \u2013 55% chance \u2013** If you think my predictions are conservative just keep in mind these chances are all infinitely higher than they ever were in past Senate Sessions. Getting this far is a big milestone so we need to be patient. \n\nAfter the Memorial Day break Senators will return to work from June 7th \u2013 25th. This is another 3 week period where legislation will need to be introduced for movement. I believe these is an incrementally higher likelihood of introduction here. Watching Sen. Schumer for a change in behavior (goes quiet for a week or more, or begins to talk in direct terms of timeline) could be useful, however I believe we will not get any communication of a \u201cdrop date\u201d until the day it happens or the night before. \n\nFor those wondering what exactly will happen when the bill is introduced here\u2019s the picture: once the bill is completed (fully written) it is submitted to the Clerk\u2019s office and is given a Bill Number which becomes it\u2019s vehicle for movement. That number does not change regardless of the content. Sometimes entire pieces of legislation are swopped in and out but the number does not change. You can literally take a bill that has passed committee, swop the entire content including the title, and use that vehicle to send it to the floor. Wild, yes, but a useful parliamentary trick in tight times. (For those skeptics please note this is not done often and everyone is aware of what they are voting on. This is not trickery, just parliamentary process to the max. Once it has a number it is introduced on the floor (unceremoniously, this is not a moment for debate or votes of any matter) and sent to committee. This is done almost with the click of a mouse at this point so do not expect flare.\n\nThe flare will come from Sen. Schumer who will likely stand in front of a podium on the Senate steps, perhaps with colleagues, and once more tell us what we know: that the time has come for legislative movement on Cannabis. And that\u2019s the show. It goes to committee and might be there for a bit.\n\nIf we get a bill in June we should, again, expect a wait. It will go to committee and we can watch for hearings or votes to be scheduled. The fastest track likely would be for committee action the following sessions.\n\n**July 56% -** The next session starts after the fourth of July recess and takes us to the summer recess in August (July 12th to August 6). A little history: Congress started their first sessions back when the Legislature was in Philadelphia. Philly in August in sweltering (as is D.C. for that matter) so getting out and going home in August was as much about spending time back in their home districts as it was about getting \u201cout of dodge\u201d. Showering was not a big part of hygiene at the time and deodorant wouldn\u2019t be invented for another century.\n\nI might be getting cheeky with the 56% however, if we haven\u2019t seen a bill drop by the July month we might be able to surmise that things are not going well for Schumer. The content should be done by this time and if nothing is being introduced after the spring push there might not be the votes and no way to get them. Do not panic! But note that this third working session is likely the last good chance we have. That said, I believe a \u201cbill before August recess\u201d is written somewhere on a Legislative Advisors notebook with a circle around it. Everyone who works in that building knows that August recess marks a shift in the working environment. This is a time when we go from a legislative calendar of ideas to when we get things done because we have to (read: government budget, avert shutdowns, etc.)\n\n**September \u2013 December** **40% -** Once they come there is still a good period of time to do work. If they have no introduced legislation yet September and October are when we\u2019re likely to see something happen. \\*\\*Bear in mind there is an election November of 2022 and members will be going home either to run for their seats or to campaign for colleagues. This means they cannot take as big of political risks as in prior months when things have a chance to settle down afterward.\\*\\*\n\nThere are also fewer clear cut periods of work and recess at this point. Yes, there is a Thanksgiving holiday and there are other weeks off for District Work, however the fall is usually \u201cgo time\u201d and when the legislation outweighs the legislative calendar. Breaks are moved or removed, and the committee schedules get hectic. This can be good as the flurry of activity can promote progress, it also might mean Cannabis legislation takes a back seat. It is impossible to know.\n\nI reduced the likelihood for 40% but not lower because it is still very possible to see introduction and movement at this point. Just keep in mind that the longer it takes to see introduction more significant the hurdles are facing the bill. It becomes exponentially more difficult (from an outsider\u2019s perspective) as we hit the fall.\n\n**Conclusion:** This year there are 4 major periods of time when legislation can move. Once it is introduced expect committee movement to the floor in the following period. As mentioned in Part 1 the introduction is the key as it means Schumer has done the hardest parts of whip counts and is ready for votes. The sooner the better but there is reasons to be hopeful all the way through the summer. August recess really provides the first moment for concern and pause. Once introduced there will be several milestones ([explained in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/mvlfnc/understanding_washington_the_cannabis_road_map/)) and each one will be followed by some down time. Trade accordingly if you like.\n\n**Special Circumstances:** There are a few other circumstances for passage. I do not give them high likelihoods for success but will share here:\n\n**Omnibus Legislation** \u2013 Something that Congress often does in the fall is put together dozens of budget bills into an omnibus bill. These are useful to get a budget passed without having votes on every single subcommitee\u2019s bill (think 1 vote for Defense, Transportation, Housing, etc.) and are relatively frequently used. They are especially common as a way to give cover to members who may not like what is inside every part of the bill but don\u2019t want to shut down the government. \n\nWhile these bills do allow leadership to add some wish-list items to the legislation they are **not the typical vehicle** for legislation around major reforms. This would not be \u201csneaking in\u201d cannabis and would be large enough of an issue to derail any omnibus passage. Not to mention this would likely sour the political waters if the GOP has already said no to the reform package. **Change of happening? 5%**\n\n**Reconciliation Bill:** All the rage this year is talk of the concept of budget reconciliation. This mechanism allows for a bill, focused on budget issues, to be passed by only 51 votes in the Senate (or 50+ VP). This parliamentary procedure was developed to ensure when budgets have issues they can be easily fixed and not destroyed by a filibuster. The content of that bill can be broader so long as it is related to the budget. Cannabis reform is note likely to fit that description. HOWEVER, even if it were to be budget oriented the White House and Congressional Dems have plans for their limited reconciliation power. The infrastructure bill and The American Families Plan are both lined up for using this process. Additionally immigration reform might be in line for a reconciliation bill if needed. The Cannabis reform bill is not going to get the limousine treatment through Congress. **Change of happening? &lt;1%**\n\n**Smaller Bills**: This one continues to come up. What if Sen. Brown moves the Banking Bill separately? All things are on the table and under consideration but I expect this to be unlikely. Even if comprehensive reform is not passable I expect the Dems know they can only get a comprehensive bill to move if they have banking included. However it is possible they read the writing on the wall this fall and decide to try. **Change of happening? 15%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:** If we\u2019re in the 2nd inning of the Cannabis Industry story then we are in the top of the 3rd for the Legislative game. We\u2019ve got a lot more in front of us and a lot of chances for things to get good, get messy and get interesting. The straightest path still lies with Schumer introducing a comprehensive bill in the next 3 months and a compromise developing to get 60 votes by Christmas. It also remains true that introduction is the biggest and most important piece to the puzzle. Get that bill introduced as we can all feel about 25 pounds lighter. (\\*Not a done deal, but a good sign).\n\nWhatever the case may be the milestones are only temporary steps forward for the stocks and until the bill is fully passed and the agencies have developed new regulations we cannot expect to have a good understanding of what this means for the industry. \n\nTo close out the metaphor I believe we are in the 3rd inning of Game 6 up 3-2. *(for non baseball fans: we're nearing the end but have a ways to go).* We can afford to lose this year but we can\u2019t afford to lose out indefinitely. 2021 remains our best chance, near term, to see something happen \u2013 watch closely, but not too closely. The big milestones are going to be obvious and they are the only things that matter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Tl;dr: Between now and the Fall there are a handful of periods when we can expect legislation to drop. The sooner the better. If and When it does there\u2019s a slow but steady process toward passage.*",

It operates mainly in the USA but has a presence in Slovakia (East Europe). Before the 2008 Financial crisis it was a 50B company and in the past years it\u2019s stock price kept fluctuating between $4 and $50.\n\n**In Depth Overview (Yahoo Finance)**\n\nUnited States Steel Corporation produces and sells flat-rolled and tubular steel products primarily in North America and Europe.

I have no position yet on this stock but a buy order set at $22.50 since friday; I'm confident it will dip following today's sharp 8% rise. You have to decide whether you want to play this for a month or six months, the weekly chart shows that this could probably shoot to $50 by end of year but i\u2019m confident that if people discover about this hidden gem it could do it by mid summer and why not, go even higher. In any case I don\u2019t see this crashing hard since it\u2019s a strong company, and because it has a mid market cap if it runs it will almost certainly not be stopped by a shitty offering.\n\n[Entry](https://preview.redd.it/321u94o6yyw61.png?width=1586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e63cc5af304e01e96f10addfb6acb1c317230296)",
