        "selftext": "When I write here I try to make it funny and pay hommage to the founding fathers degenerate natures while giving actual DD. Clear point neuro is a couple of different things, but the short and skinny is that they're a network of neurosurgeons that work with a few other areas of expertise. Most notably other companies constructing human and non human primate trials, e.g., see Charles River labs, Bayer, PTC therapeutics, Blue Rock therapeutics, Uniqure., etc (and there are more). They are also one of the only companies performing procedures where a parkisons patient doesn't have to be awake or off medication to implant a deep brain stimulator, which seems pretty fucking cool to me. But the real meat of this post is this: clearpoint has every single clinical trial partner they work with by the balls (of which 6 have concluded). If any treatment in the pipeline is approved, they are tied to their original partner, clearpoint. Why? Because that's who delivered the procedure. None of the shit that is done in these trials would be possible without the products that clearpoint has built. And having clearance to do it with anything else would, in my mind, necessitate an additional trial to see if the tools can safely and effectively deliver therapeutics.\n\nOnce we can reliably get to any structure inside the CNS and brain, can effectively deliver that therapy, and have that therapy either correct or allow the cells to express a gene correctly, we have an untreated patient population that exceeds 10m as viable treatment targets. A bidding war will ensue across basically any patient population and company where the number of patients exceeds the clinics ability to perform neurosurgery (of which clearpoint has managed their way into 61 clinics so far), and I don't know if you looked recently, but there are not that many neurosurgeons. In the US there are almost 2000 fewer neurosurgeons than hospitals. I would not be surprised to see approved treatments priced well into the millions. \n\nNeedless to say, I am long as fuck. I own about 2k shares, have purchased a number of ITM calls and I have sold some gay bears ITM puts. I am planning to sell my car in 6 or so months, and roll over an additional 17k from the S&amp;P500 to additional shares and ITM calls. For the special kind of retard that spent the time to read this DYOD.",
