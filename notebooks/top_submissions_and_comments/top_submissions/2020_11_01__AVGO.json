        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

[https://ibb.co/Fzd8TMw](https://ibb.co/Fzd8TMw) / [https://ibb.co/NLnw4Lv](https://ibb.co/NLnw4Lv)\n\nWhile the other communication provider that I like is T-Mobile US which has seen a huge spike in user growth and are poised to do a lot of great things with the 5G cycle, they trade at a very high multiple for this sector but the growth expectations are huge for this company. [https://ibb.co/PCDFD38](https://ibb.co/PCDFD38) / [https://ibb.co/BTSzTMp](https://ibb.co/BTSzTMp)\n\nMoving on, one of the biggest gainers this year, TESLA is also one of my favorite companies to own as they continue to expand the products they offer and improve margins on vehicle, they are also expanding into more and more services, while manufacturing is growing exponentialy. They trade at insane P/E\u2019s but they have just managed to be included in the SP500 so this may bring some stability to the stock as the company continues to grow in the next decade.[https://ibb.co/6rNJf6q](https://ibb.co/6rNJf6q) / [https://ibb.co/CWN6wD4](https://ibb.co/CWN6wD4)\n\nVisa is the biggest global payments technology company and is expected to continue to grow as more people start using cashless payment options, they are a great growth and value company for the future as cash payments is a dying proposition worldwide. [https://ibb.co/CVXgZD9](https://ibb.co/CVXgZD9) / [https://ibb.co/BPKxFfZ](https://ibb.co/BPKxFfZ)\n\nWal-Mart, the biggest employer in the US continues to do amazing stuff as they continue to expand they\u2019re online presence and compete with Amazon as they trade at a 23 P/E and also offer a dividend yield. they are a great play alongside with Amazon which trades at much higher valuations. [https://ibb.co/Sr9s83J](https://ibb.co/Sr9s83J) / [https://ibb.co/0CvZKkD](https://ibb.co/0CvZKkD)\n\nWynn is another great recovery stock that I like as recently we found out that foot traffic in Macau has ramped up, this bolds well for the company as they will be one of the biggest gainers on the reopening. So if you are a long term investor you should get into this stock I believe. [https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ](https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ) / [https://ibb.co/mC35VPr](https://ibb.co/mC35VPr)\n\nZoom is the one company that I will be selling in the next couple of days. I know they are one of the best video conferencing apps out there, but I believe they will have a lot of problem due to a number of free apps that also offer great quality while the company is trading at insane p/e numbers. I know this trend is here to stay, but I thing there are far better play in the stock market out there rather than Zoom at this price point.  [https://ibb.co/T1tStb8](https://ibb.co/T1tStb8) / [https://ibb.co/rmxh0x3](https://ibb.co/rmxh0x3)\n\nI know I didn\u2019t get into in-depth stuff, technical analysis, fundamentals and more but I will continue go more in depth with this stocks as time goes on. \n\nSo here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)\n\nAs you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don\u2019t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs.

        "selftext": "I'm a relatively new investor (22 M) who began buying individual stocks this March. While I still keep the majority of my investments in an S&amp;P 500 ETF and dollar-cost average into it every week, I wanted to see what people think about how I analyze my individual stock picks which in general I want to be more risky than my ETF. Some of the criteria I look at includes: \n\n1. Revenues/Earnings: I am usually more interested in if a company is growing revenues year-over-year versus earnings. The newer the company, the less I am worried about its EPS and P/E ratio. \n2. Market Cap: Do I see potential for the stock's value to continue raising or does it feel like the company is grossly overvalued relative to its revenues/earnings? \n3. Industry: I like to buy companies where I can see a growing/expanding industry or if there is a specific catalyst that will propel the stock forward over a certain time period (ex: oil stocks when Covid goes away).\n4. Analyst Ratings: In general I trust the consensus on the analyst's buy/hold/sell ratings and their price targets. My opinion is they probably know more about the stock as it is their job to evaluate companies. \n5. Volume: I usually don't like stocks with a super high volume because I feel like they are very volatile and a lot of the trading is from pump-and-dumpers or day traders. Exception is if it's a huge, well-established company that has had high volume for awhile. \n\nOverall I've earned more relative to the overall market since March and my current holdings include AMZN, BABA, SHOP, AVGO, DKNG, CRM, PTON, FANG, APHA. Does anyone see any flaws in my thinking or what are some main criteria that you look for? Thanks!",

So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.
