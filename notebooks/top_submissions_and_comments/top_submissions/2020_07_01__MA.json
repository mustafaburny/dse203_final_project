Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah!

        "selftext": "**A Quick Note:** This is meant to be a purely charting and analytical approach to evaluating market movements. Although I have been very successful in the past predicting movements traders should always make an effort to adjust their positions based on changing political and media landscapes. This approach isn\u2019t meant to be any more accurate than a meteorologist predicting the weather. Take positions at your own risk and always do your own due diligence. I release these for thoughtful criticism from traders who use different approaches for analysis.\n\n**Tl;dr:** There no resistance left and there\u2019s no reason to believe we\u2019ll see a significant drop (below 305) without so major news to throw the market into turmoil again.\n\nTicker: $SPY\n\nIntervals: 1W, 1D, 4H\n\nIndicators: MACD, KDJ, MA(13 &amp; 30), NetVolume, VPVR, Relative Volume\n\nCharts: https://imgur.com/gallery/k5CRAcE\n\n**Signals: **\n\n1W: MACD Bullish Diverging, Net Volume (397.5M) Bullish, KDJ Slightly Overbought Nuetral\n\n1D: MACD Neutral Inconclusive, Net Volume (62M) Bearish, KDJ Overbought Slightly ullish \n\n4H: MACD Convergent Inconclusive, Net Volume (23M) Bullish, KDJ Overbought Nuetral/Slight Bullish Divergence\n\nKey Supports: \n\n305\n\n213\n\n218\n\nKey Resistances:\n\n323\n\nPosition: Put Credit Spread, 305/300 7/27\n\nTargets: Buying to open position if the market retests support at 318 or below. Take profit and stop-loss is not necessary due to the nature of the position. Just let theta do the work\n\nNews: [California Gov. Gavin Newsom pressed the panic button on Monday and locked down his state again.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/californias-second-shutdown-11594770566\\)\n\n[Four months on from the passage of the first coronavirus stimulus package in March, Congress is gearing up to work out the terms of a second injection into the U.S. economy\u2014but debates over a few red lines could stall the process.](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-democrats-draw-red-lines-relief-deal-1518660)\n\n[As the number of new coronavirus cases in Texas continues to rise and hospitals grow more crowded, Gov. [Greg Abbott](https://www.texastribune.org/directory/greg-abbott/) said Thursday there is no statewide shutdown looming.](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/16/texas-shutdown-greg-abbott/\\)\n\n[Some fantastic DD by u/MiltDavis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/htqy2k/dd\\_your\\_tendie\\_stimulus\\_vxx\\_qqq\\_and\\_spy\\_during/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf\\)\n\n**Analysis: **\n\n**Technical:** Momentum has neutralized on almost every interval. $SPY has passed through every major resistance in its volume profile with only 1% of the total active float above current market price. With almost every long position currently held yielding a profit there is no reason to expect a bearish shift in sentiment without a significant news catalyst.\n\n**Narrative:** Although stocks are closing at all-time highs behind the scenes investors are keeping their options open. Gold and other precious metals have been bought up at a historical price moving in step with stock prices. Even treasury bond prices have seen solid gains over the last two weeks with TLT holding a modest 2% gain since July second. Despite these gains VIX remains stuck at higher than average levels.\n\n**So what\u2019s happening?**\n\nCommitment to accommodating monetary and fiscal policy has propped the market up to all-time highs while doing nothing to quell the underlying feeling of uncertainty most investors are experiencing. The only thing certain at this point is inflation as demonstrated by consistent depreciation in $UUP. It\u2019s simple really, the only place you can\u2019t put your money is\u2026. Money?\n\nIf $NFLX earnings have shown us anything it\u2019s that even the star players of the COVID-19 crisis are going to report mediocre growth this season. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if $AMZN fairs better than Netflix but will it meet investor expectations? Likely not, but we\u2019re hostages of fiscal policy.\n\n**So what do we do?** \n \n\nDo what the big boys do\u2026 hedge! There\u2019s a reason stocks are reaching ATH while typically negatively correlated ETF\u2019s are also seeing similar gains as well as the VIX holding value. No one knows for sure where to place their money they just know they can\u2019t hold cash. \n\nWith a second possible stimulus coming a final rally through the stubborn resistance at 323 is well within the realm of possibility but try to remember the negotiations prior to the last stimulus bill\u2026. Constant bickering back and forth, meeting that almost always went nowhere until suddenly something was passed. Now, a more autistic trader than I may be willing to try and time bipartisanship, but I\u2019ve been in this country a little to long for that. Let time work for you, any position with theta on your side makes sense, but my preferred play here is a PCS (put credit spread).\n\nWith tech showing relative weakness and $MRNA announcing a possible vaccine may be on the horizon expect money to quickly flow out of Covid-19 stars and back to long neglected industries like tourism, gaming, sports, and retail.\n\nSo, to summarize, we\u2019re seeing market wide rebalancing, because the truth is the rollercoaster is over. Your deep OTM $SPY puts are fucc, you didn\u2019t outsmart the market. The bear is defeated for now. \n\nYoutube Walkthrough on TA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfK7Acy691E\n\nAlternative Plays: JETS, DIS, VIX",

After SoftBank bailed the company out they added Marcelo Claure as chairman, who is credited with turning around Sprint and negotiating their merger with T-Mobile.

However the Weston's don't actually own a majority of it, rather they own 63% of a publicly traded corporation called George Weston which itself owns 47% of Loblaws. Keeping to the strategy of creating russian nesting dolls of companies to basically retain control over companies you effectively only really own a quarter of they have also split off the real estate of the grocery stores into Choice Properties REIT, which is majority owned by Loblaws. Thus the Weston family controls this REIT despite really only owning an eighth of it.  \n\n\nGeorge Weston TSE:WN  \nLoblaws Companies Limited TSE:L  \nChoice Properties TSE:CHP.UN  \n\n\nOn the other side of the Pond, the Weston's also have another Top Order shell called Wittington Investments, which is 80% owned by Garfield Weston Foundation, which is a charity (or \"charity\" for tax avoidance if you feel it more appropriate). The other 20% is owned by individual members of the Weston family. The main holding of Wittington Investments is Associated British Foods at 54.5%, and some department stores in the UK and Ireland. Associated British Foods is a component of the British Stock Exchange Index the FTSE100, much like Loblaws they also own clothing brand/stores, and they also have a monopsony (a situation where there is one buyer rather than a monopoly where there is one seller) where they process the entire Sugar Beet crop of the UK with British Sugar which is responsible for about half of the UK's sugar consumption.  \n\n\nAssociated British Foods LSE:ABF  \n\n\nNext lets move on to the richest man in Canada. Again guess? Hint he is literally a British Lord.  \n\n\nOkay all guesses? It is David Kenneth Roy Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet. The descendants of the late Baron of Fleet own the Woodbridge Corporation which is itself the majority owner of 62.35% Thomson Reuters. The Thomson portion is difficult to explain, as they provide \"business services\", but it seems like the consist in providing information for legal and tax matters. Might be kind of like the Bloomberg of Canada who knows. Reuters was a British media company before it was acquired. How this particular guy became the richest person in Canada is because he actually doesn't even like having to run the family business and instead has started an independent real estate empire. Pinning down exactly what that entails is difficult, but his investment activities are run by a Toronto Hedge Fund Morgan Bay Capital, and the real estate empire is called Osmington Incorporated. Osmington has sold some of its properties to the Canada Pension Plan, and seems to have intersts in \"precision agriculture\" at FarmersEdge whatever that means, and it is a partner in the group that owns the Winnipeg Jets. He is not the richest man in Canada entirely because of Thomson Reuters, but it certainly contributes to it, and what billionaire doesn't own a media conglomerate or two?  \n\n\nThomson Reuters TSE:TRI  \n\n\nNow Galen Weston is the 3rd richest Canadian, and David Thomson is the 1st, so who is on second? Tsai's on second. Joseph Tsai. Taiwanese born co-founder and Executive Vice-Chairman of Alibaba. At 13 he was sent to a prep school in New Jersey, and eventually went to his father's alma mater at Yale. He started his career as a tax associate at a New York lawfirm and eventually became an attorney following in his father's footsteeps. From there however he eventually left for Hong Kong and became involved in Asian private equity, which resulted in him eventually meeting Jack Ma, where he was so impressed that he quit his investment firm to join in the founding of Alibaba as the only western-educated founder where he was COO and CFO as he was vital due to the cross-pacific nature of Alibaba's business model and being the only one with experience in venture capital and law. He is the second largest individual shareholder of Alibaba behind only Jack Ma. Beyond that he also bought the Brooklyn Nets off a Russian billionaire, as well as being the owner of several other sports team like football and including Lacrosse which he was the avid player while in prep school and at Yale.  \n\n\nAlibaba NYSE:BABA  \n\n\nHe is a dual Hong Kong and Canadian citizen. You would think it would be American given most of the time he spent in the west was in America but when you are rich obtaining Canadian citizenship is easy and it provides most of the same benefits as American citizenship. Controversial when on the question of the NBA and Hong Kong, we weighed in stating that many Chinese were angry over tweets in support of Hong Kong because they sounded like support for separatism which is a no go for China.  \n\n\nTaiwanese politics is a bit complex, the KMT the right-wing on the island believes in a United China, its just that this united One China ought to be under the KMT, strong, free, and independent, but ultimately friendly with the West, in the vein of Sun Yat-Sen who was also western educated. It is generally the left-wing DPP which is both more independent of the Taiwanese business community and also thinks of itself as independent from China. Taiwan's biggest trade partner is China, and the KMT sees no issue with this as they see it as business being done from a province of china that is free doing business with other provinces of china which are just temporarily under Communist Party of China occupation.  \n\n\nThe business community loves the One Country Two Systems because it lets them have their cake and eat it too, but if it came down to it since Chinese business is the most important trade partner for the Hong Kong and Taiwan and they are torn when it comes to the CCP power grabbing the two systems into one system. For the business community being one country is more important for the bottom line than the two systems, so while they are against the power grab, they are also against seperatism. This is difficult to understand but many chinese still see a United China as being in a protracted civil war that has just been on pause for decades, the same way people in Korea see the Korean War as a protracted civil war that never ended rather than a war between countries. They want their freedom, but they also want their country to remain united. Ultimately this is not too dissimilar from the powerful Quebec Federalist business families which are generally the historical owners of the Liberal Party who oppose Quebec sovereignty and want a united Canada even if they support francophone rights within Canada  \n\n\nWhich brings as to the Desmarais. Paul Desmarais was the fourth wealthiest person in Canada before he died in 2013, and his family is considered the seventh on the list currently. The Desmarais Family Residual Trust controls Pansolo which itself owns about 80% of the voting shares of the Power Corporation of Canada, but 60% of those votes come from owner almost all of the preferred voting shares which give 10 votes, while they own 11% of the regular shares which translates to another 20% of the voting power. Power Corp is itself a fan of complicated ownership structures as I basically wouldn't even be able to explain all the things they own. The largest holding is 67% of Great West Life and 62% of IGM financial, both of which also have subsidiaries who operate in the United States. The also have a Partnership ownership of Group Brussels Lambert with Frere Bougeois who was the richest man in Belgium while he was alive. As a result of complicated ownership structures, with Frere Bourgeois they actually control a French Materials company called Imerys, and also own minority stakes in Adidas and Pernod Ricard. Overall the European holdings are quite diversified, and its North American holdings in Wealth/Retirement Management and Life Companies functions as a diversified asset pool due to the nature of how life insurance companies use the premiums to invest so they can eventually cover the payouts. They also own wealth management companies in China which makes it globally diversified and sector diversified. Through the complicated ownership structure it owns WealthSimple in part via Power Corp itself, but also through their majority stake in IGM financial. They also have a renewable energy division where they live up to the \"Power\" name, and beyond renewable energy they also have a 60% stake in Lumenpulse an LED manufacturer, and a 44% stake in Lion Electric and electric school bus manufacturer.   \n\n\nPower Corp TSE:POW\n\nGreat West Life TSE:GWO\n\nIGM Financial TSE:IGM\n\nGroup Brussels Lambert EBR:GBLB  \n\n\nI own Power Corp shares because I couldn't believe it was trading as low as it was and for so long, as it has a 9% yield it has since gone up almost immediately after I bought it so I got in at the right time but still has a 7% yield. Power Corp is likely the closest you will get to the concept of the revolving door of politicians in business which you can read up yourself, but safe to say all our Francophone prime ministers have been involved, mostly Liberal leaders like Chretien, Martin, and Pierre Trudeau, but also Brain Mulroney, and many Premiers of Ontario and Quebec as well. If there was ever a company that made the concept of \"the Laurentian Elite\" that run Canada clear, it is Power Corp. In regards to my politics, I'm actually in favour of the concept of seperatism as a general idea so I'm sort of inverting my politics in my investments, but despite me supporting seperatism generally, the only victory for the concept in decades has been Brexit and even then that was not really the same thing. I'm politically infavour of renewable power so I found Power Corp attractive for its investments in Power Energy. Seems as if a good investment strategy would be to inverse your political positions which have never had victories like ever and go long on your political positions which seem to be where the political headwinds are going. Power Corp seems to get its way in politics regardless if I am in support of it lol, might as well own the company that controls everything I guess.  \n\n\nThe guy who owns Rogers is next on our line of Oligarchs. Rogers is similar to Power Corp in that they attempt to have voting shares and non-voting shares so the family can control the company while not actually owning the whole thing.   \n\n\nRogers TSE: RCI.A prefered voting shares  \nRogers TSE: RCI.B non-voting shares for us plebs  \n\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_Canadians\\_by\\_net\\_worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadians_by_net_worth) \n\nYou can look at the full list here but I'm going to stop as Saputo as they are the dreaded Milk Cartel of the Bernier's nightmares\n\nSaputo TSE:SAP  \n\n\nRapid Fire Round  \n\n\nGarret Camp NYSE:UBER\n\nIrvings (Private, Oil, New Brunswick)\n\nRichardson (Private, Agricultural and Food Production)\n\nJim Pattison (Private, British Columbia Conglomerate, fun fact owns Guinness World Records)\n\nJeffery Skoll (NASDAQ:EBAY, Participant a privately owned film production studio)\n\nRichard Li (Hong Kong Telecom, SEHK:8)\n\nAzireli Family (Israeli Real Estate, TLV:AZRG, fun fact the Azireli Towers used to be the tallest buildings in Israel)\n\nCarlo Fidani (Mississauga based real estate)  \n\n\nBernard Sherman (Privately held Pharmaceutical company Apotex)   \n\n\nMcCain family (Beyond McCain foods, Wallace McCain after being ousted from McCain by his brother Harrison purchased Maple Leaf Foods together with the Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan ... somehow lets not question it.

Plus the risks I saw in Tortoise's SEC Filings from the 10-K back in March were risks pertaining to them not being involved in any company at that time period. The risks I saw in their recent 10-Q Filing from May were just risks in terms of the Corona virus that may potentially affect business, just like all the other businesses that include the virus in their SEC filings. \n  * That being said, there are risks. In my opinion, a lot can go wrong. They can lose a partner they have with manufacturing, something could go wrong during the merger finalization. There's always risks that a merger does not go smoothly. This is a huge merger, at it's completion, the company will be valued at over $1Billion dollars. So any mistake during the merger would be a big problem. \n  * I personally believe everything will go smoothly, but I just had to mention those risks I see that are a possibility.\n  * Now upon completion, this could skyrocket the same way Nikola did. Nikola's FCEV truck won't be available until 2023 whereas Hyliion's is available next year, plus Hyliion already has electric hybrids available now. That being said, plus the valuation brought upon the merger completion, and the pre-order of 1000 Hypertrucks made by Agility. I feel the price of the shares have the possiblity to surpass Nikola's share price.\n  * As always, please do extend my DD by adding your own to it and making sure you are well informed with everything I've written and tagged through links.\n\n\n\nAnyways, hope this DD has helped in any way possible. For me it's a long hold. I'm holding for a while, at minimum until end of Q3 which is when it is expected to close. Hope you guys have a great day today. Take care Everyone!\n\n\n\n\n**As found on their investors Presentation page: \"Completion of the transaction is expected to occur around the end of the third quarter \r\nof 2020\"**",

I'm just a 16 year old looking to find a good stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is $AYRO?** \n\nAYRO, Inc. is a U.S-based designer and manufacturer of purpose-built, automotive-grade, all-electric vehicles. They produce EV Vehicles similar to $NKLA $WKHS $SHLL etc. They have a market cap of ONLY $50 MILLION making it a micro micro market cap company.  They have more revenue than WKHS and a lower float than WKHS as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Goal of AYRO:**\n\n \u2022 \"Our AYRO electric vehicles help higher ed, corporate, and government entities eliminate volatile fuel storage and CO2 Emissions and reduce noise signatures by up to 75%.  \n\n\u2022 Our electric vehicles are designed to traverse streets, narrow passages and campus walkways safely and use automotive controls for familiarity and ease of operation.  \n\n\u2022 Compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle, AYRO electric vehicles have fewer moving parts and are up to 50% less costly to maintain. This means greater vehicle uptime and more efficiency across your fleet.  Texas-based AYRO, Inc., designs and delivers compact, emissions-free electric fleet solutions for use within urban and short\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why AYRO will \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 )**\n\n\\*This company has a PR coming soon I believe (Not sure please fact check)\n\n\\*Company merged with DropCar ($DCAR yes the Notorious one)  \n\n\n\\*They very recently expanded their electric vehicle manufacturing facility\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*MOST if not ALL EV Related stocks have completely went parabolic including:  \n$NKLA   \n$TSLA  \n$SHLL  \n$WKHS  \n$SOLO\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*They have one of the lowest floats  [https://lowfloatreport.com/](https://lowfloatreport.com/) \n\n\\*Volume is starting to REALLY pump. And people are actually JUST starting to spread, tweet, post Reddit stuff about this etc. Just yesterday there was nearly 20 million volume :).\n\n\\*Looking like the same **EXACT** pattern where AYRO went from $2 to $6 with ONLY a FRACTION of the volume it has now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Basic/Important Resources To Check Out:**  \n\\*[https://lowfloatreport.com/](https://lowfloatreport.com/)  (Float of $AYRO)\n\n\\*[https://communityimpact.com/austin/round-rock-pflugerville-hutto/impacts/2020/07/02/round-rock-based-ayro-expands-electric-vehicle-manufacturing-facility/](https://communityimpact.com/austin/round-rock-pflugerville-hutto/impacts/2020/07/02/round-rock-based-ayro-expands-electric-vehicle-manufacturing-facility/) \n\n\\*[https://secure.ayro.com/merger/](https://secure.ayro.com/merger/) \n\n\\*[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200528005742/en/DropCar-AYRO-Stockholders-Approve-Merger#:\\~:text=Immediately%20prior%20to%20the%20Merger,dividend%20declared%20on%20the%20common](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200528005742/en/DropCar-AYRO-Stockholders-Approve-Merger#:~:text=Immediately%20prior%20to%20the%20Merger,dividend%20declared%20on%20the%20common) \n\n\\*[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200310005529/en/AYRO---Club-Car-Partnership-Announce-Deliveries](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200310005529/en/AYRO---Club-Car-Partnership-Announce-Deliveries) \n\n\\* [https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/06/30/ayro-reverse-merger-coronavirus-impact.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/06/30/ayro-reverse-merger-coronavirus-impact.html) \n\n\\* [https://ayro.com/partnerships/](https://ayro.com/partnerships/)  (Partnerships)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVideo on AYRO if your interested  [https://twitter.com/ayroinc/status/1276562700752097281?s=21](https://twitter.com/ayroinc/status/1276562700752097281?s=21) \n\nSome of these are old news, but the reason why they haven't moved yet was because literally no one saw it. The volume of AYRO was barely holding 500k, just recently we've been getting 2+mil volume in fact on Thursday there was a 20 mil volume day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GREAT AYRO CHART:** \n\n\\*RSI is picking up HEAT but it still needs fuel. RSI is at 56 which means its at a good deal, and it doesn't look like there will be a dip anytime soon \n\n\\*MACD is crossing over last time it did this $AYRO went from $2 to $6! \n\n\\*Squeeze breakout! This stock was having trouble climbing past that $3 zone and now that it's past that point its going to rocket! \n\n\\*Volume picking up just like $GNUS $SHIP $TOPS etc. This volume came out of NOWHERE and could continue to go higher if there's more fuel to the rocket. \n\n\\*Strong solid company. Brand new, and there having a PR soon too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHIT SIDE/CONS ON AYRO:**\n\nThis is a REALLY micro stock the Market Cap is literally in the $50millions. On top of this we don't know if EV Stocks are going to cool off this week. This is really important in my opinion, but the thing is **if people notice that AYRO is an EV Stock and notice it hasn't bounced yet FOMO will hit them like a truck because they wouldn't want to miss the next $SHLL $WKHS etc driving the price up**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother con about this company is the fact that they merged with the **NOTORIOUS DCAR** yes the shitty company. If I'm right about this there are LOTS of shorts/asks on DCAR (If that's how it works). Meaning that there might be a Resistance/Wall we would have to break in order for this thing to Rocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is **SOME** resistance at the $3.30 mark because of DCAR, the MA 50 is at $3.35 while the 200 MA is at the $3.37 mark. But then again it has completely obliterated the 50 and 200 MA before when there was **NO VOLUME,** Plus using other indicators (RSI/MACD) it looks like we will absolutely destroy the $3.40 mark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHY FOMO MIGHT CAUSE THIS TO ROCKET**\n\nEveryone wants to get a piece of the EV stock hype. Just look at:  \nWKHS  \nSOLO  \nTSLA  \nSHLL  \nNKLA  \n\n\nAll literally went up 100%+ yet **AYRO has barely moved.** And by this logic people are going to see this and think \"hmm, I can get in early as hell because of how hot EV stocks are now maybe I should get in!\". And once it AYRO pumps a bit, and goes up, up, up, up people will literally FOMO the fuck out of this stock just like NKLA and WKHS. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Stocktwits AYRO went from having around a few hundred \"Watchers\" to 2000 on Thursday to over 5500 TODAY. People are JUST noticing this stock which is insane. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 TO THE MOOON!! \n\nJokes aside this is a **REALLY Solid Play in my opinion**. It has really low float, great CEO, low market cap, more revenue than WKHS. And EV stocks are SO HOT right now. \n\nChart wise, the RSI is curling up (Really bullish) and has a 56 meaning its a great deal, MACD is curling (Very Bullish), squeeze through and starting to push off the Resistance (50, 200MA) already. Volume picking up so much etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolid solid NEWS, PR soon (I believe), 2x facility, merge with DCAR \n\nThis price target of this stock is LIMITLESS it can literally go to $10+ and could be the next WKHS/NKLA if it gets hyped enough and we get more and more buyers. Overall I'm bullish\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst quick DD/Charting I've ever done so no hate please &lt;3\n\nI will post more in an EDIT section if I find more juicy stuff.",

        "selftext": "First off, I want to clarify and reiterate, [Fisker Automotive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisker_Automotive) (now Karma Automotive) is NOT [Fisker, Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisker_Inc). Same co-founder, different companies, still a lot of confusion over this point.  \n\n\nI bought two weeks back, when I noticed [SPAQ switched their web site header](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/hgicgi/changes_at_spartan_energy_acquisition_corp_spaq/) and John J MacWilliams rejoined the board. Energy SPACs pivoting to \"green\" targets have been quite successful this year (SHLL, HCCH, etc). It was a gamble, but I figured this is Apollo, and I'll get another decent renewable energy play (I'm in many of these, beyond SPACs).   \n\n\nI've was skeptical of the SPAQ/Fisker rumors: SPAQ is [asking for a 6 month extension](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000121390020016770/pre14a0120_spartanenergy.htm); most of the board has [energy exploration backgrounds](http://www.spartanenergyspac.com/), not automotive or EVs; Fisker just raised [50 million](https://twitter.com/FiskerInc/status/1280821225455935489). I've changed my mind.  \n\n\n1. Fisker, Inc's raise was at a [valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-08/louis-bacon-backed-fund-invests-50-million-in-ev-maker-fisker) of around \\~1.6B (SPAQ has [\\~570M in the bank](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000121390020011332/f10q0320_spartanenergy.htm)). A company at $1.6-2.2B is just about right for merger with a SPAC of SPAQ's size  (general rule is a SPAC [should raise](https://www.mwe.com/insights/inside-ma-october-2015/) 1/4-1/3 of enterprise value, additional money can be brought in by PIPE if needed).\n2. There is/was allegedly a bidding war, so what else can Apollo bring to Fisker, Inc beyond cash? An experienced/well-connected ex-DOE [board member](https://www.energy.gov/contributors/john-j-macwilliams) (who, intriguingly, left and then very recently [re-joined](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000121390020015984/ea123511-8k_spartanenergy.htm) SPAQ). What better way to secure future government contracts/financing than by having an ex-DOE hand on your board. That's a benefit other suitors probably can't match. And might be extra relevant given the previous company's [history](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fisker-doe/u-s-government-fisker-grilled-over-loans-to-green-carmaker-idUSBRE93N14J20130424).\n3. Founder has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/henrikfisker/status/1281247742581280768) some vague and optimistic things like, \"We are accelerating our development!\" \n\nHODLing this SPAC and hopeful, but if this deal falls through or the rumor turns out to be nonsense, I have faith the extension will be approved and Apollo will find me my renewable energy play in time.",

        "selftext": "I really fail to see why a larger majority of people don't do this with their savings. I started passive investing in 2019 which gave me like a 15% return. I started active investing in 2020 heavily buying tech companies and financials with solid companies like visa, Mastercard, apple, etc. Obviously buying in the March dip has made it possible for 40% returns so quickly but even outside of that, some of these companies are so obvious good buys.\n\nShopify, zoom, teladoc to play off the virus. Continue to buy and sell and play off the financial news seems to be very solid. I would have gone into NIO, Tesla, or PLUG looking back instead of selling but that's alright since there seems to always be another new fad out there. I hopped on the train for data dog, square, and some others. \n\nIs it really that easy to make 20% on average every year at a minimum by buying and selling or buying and holding actively? Buy the dips. Set stop losses. Recessions are a huge boon since you get to buy the best companies at a big discount. Historically, we are by and large in an ongoing bull market no matter what short term multi month or multi year setbacks seem to be thrown at us.\n\nWhat will a decade or lifetime of investing show me as a negative that I can't find at the moment? My main thesis so far is that you need a lot of money to make A LOT of way more money and this is literally the key. I don't see why you wouldn't throw hundreds of thousand of dollars at amazon during March and April if you had it. ",

        "selftext": "So my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf8nin/did_you_see_the_woman_in_the_red_dress/) got taken down, and since it is literally as perkynent as it was two weeks ago (June 24th), ehfff offff and give 'er a read (minus BYND and MCD because true, not tech, and sideways blech). Today was red right?\n\nIf you're the horniest of Chad bull superstars, then today was a perfect red day. Why you ask? &gt;!Shut up.!&lt; Put your $ZM puts away and realize praying the bear away doesn't work. If $DIS can stay up through all of this why in JPOW's mother did you think your puts would print? We are not hitting lower lows - get your ass out of apocalypto and into the higher highs that we are seeing in all the meme / tech / zero earnings but all of the tendies / why are you still fighting the fed stocks. Finally to summarize, the next crash is when sports come back and all the gamblers pull their money, but not a second sooner. The ma and pa investors want their piece of the richer-than-they-could-imagine-casino and will be the last to pull out.\n\nUSD crash? Stonks go up as international money floods into equities. USD gains? Inflation stays managed and the Fed keeps printing. Pull out in October if you can't handle taking JPOW's money, but do you really think Grandpa Joe wants the stock market to crumble under his leadership? Look at the gains under Obama, you really think Biden wants his graph versus Obama's to be dog shit?\n\nOn days like today, how much has dropped compared to where those same stocks were last week? If your winners' low's (LOL this aged well) today are higher than the stock was last week, you're trending up. Let your winners keep trending up for maximum gainage, and buy two months out minimum. Yes the economy is falling apart - the stock market isn't the economy. Yes the Fed is printing like mad - so is every country in the world. What about 2008 charts? Yes absolutely - keep those for 2022 when borrowing money isn't dirt cheap. Want to make money?\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 $AAPL 430c Jan21 $AMZN 3700c Jan21 $ZM 300 Jan21 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTLDR: tech is safer than gold\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/a/9J4qceJ)",

        "selftext": " Hello, I usually post in WSB but the market cap of AGRX violates their rules so I am posting here as I follow r/PennyStocks and have held some in the past (IDEX, NOG, GNUS just to name a few and currently have Rolls Royce which I think qualifies as a Penny Stock now) I appreciate many of the posts here and this is me sharing some of my thoughts. Some of you may know me from my very extensive HUYA DD.  Which was taken down by the MODs (I believe) after I posted an update to some of the trading shenanigans that happened during earnings. Huya DD was solid and if you sold just half of your holdings before earnings you would have been up 900% on the FDs and the Leaps I recommended are currently up 250%+ (I am still holding these and plan on holding at least until August) Apologies for my grammar I have Dysgraphia and Dyslexia my sentence structure is brutal.  This is how it comes out of my head I\u2019m just trying to relay the information.\n\nTLDR = Agile Therapeutics is worth $7.xx right now and could be bought out at any moment for a Billionish +/-, someone doesn\u2019t want you to know about it.  \n\nBUY SHARES = 101-10001 shares depending on bankroll (Maybe more use your judgement)\n\nBuy Options = Sept 18th $2.5 Call December 18th $2.5 call (Safe plays) I believe the price on this will move fast so as the price goes up the $5 options become safer plays FYI\n\nany $5 option 7/17, 8/21, 9/18 (these are Buyout lottery tickets if you like the risky stuff but you could wake up one day to a big pile of money. \n\nBUY THESE SHARES UP BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP THIS STOCK HUSH HUSH\n\nEND TLDR\n\nAgile Therapeutics is worth $7.XX+ maybe more right now. I take this position as Corona shouldn\u2019t have dipped this stock and we just recently found out TWIRLA pricing and we have an idea of the addressable market. Agile could be bought out at any time for as much as $9-$11 which is 3x-4x it\u2019s current trading price of $2.75 and people are trying to keep a lid on things.  \n\nAGRX $2.75 Current MarketCap $246 Million.  What is it worth? DD Inside\n\n[AGRX Stock Overview](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/agrx)\n\nAGRX is a company built around a drug called Twirla.  It\u2019s a sticker that can be applied to administer birth control\n\nDon\u2019t want babies = Apply sticker\n\nWant babies = Remove Sticker\n\nEasy Peasy. This isn\u2019t a new idea, it has been done before but that patch can cause increased amounts of blood clots so it has gone out of favor.  At one time though 11% of the birth control market was a patch.    \n\nAGRX almost didn\u2019t get this drug approved in fact many people left them for dead. Surprise!!! it actually works great for people as long as they are under 30 BMI which is obese classification.\n\nThis is actually a great way to take certain medicines if anyone knows of someone doing this with THC DM ME PLEASE.  If AGRX can convert this Twirla tech to THC triple all numbers.  LOL\n\nThere is a normal cycle to the value of things. AGRX is undervalued because it was a late bloomer and it almost wasn\u2019t approved by the FDA. Once that approval happened the normal price run up occurred.  \n\nFDA Approval occurred Valentines Day February 14 (Point of Interest)\n\n[FDA Twirla Approval](https://www.wsj.com/articles/agile-therapeutics-gets-fda-ok-for-twirla-contraceptive-patch-151581726381)\n\nPrice Peaked at $4.77\n\nThe way these things usually work in Biotech is the next stage is dilution. Company sells stock to raise money to get them to the next stage\n\nOn the 21st of February AGRX announced it was issuing 15 million new shares @$3.00 this is normal and the sale was successful. AGRX now has enough money to make it to the next stages.  \n\nAGRX [Dilution](https://www.medtechy.com/articles/2020/agile-therapeutics-stock-offering-only-a-short-term-setback-after-twirla-approval)\n\nNormally a short time after the Bio-tech stock will start creeping up in price as normal price discovery occurs.  Not this time though as Corona jitters hit.\n\nCorona Low\n\n[High Mid February, Then Dilution and bad timing on the Corona dip](https://preview.redd.it/i5gb1qras9951.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c879dc6be8d3867e562e45f6be5534a0da330623)\n\nImportant thing about Corona it shouldn\u2019t have affected AGRX stock price as people are not going to stop taking Birth Control (Possibly going to take more of it as they are in lockdown with the kids not in school)  The purpose of the stock dilution was to give AGRX the money to work on the next stage.  It was successful and AGRX could simply be working on getting their product to market with no financial worries in the short term the Corona issues in the world do not affect AGRX's ability to go to market as they got there money from the offering already.\n\nThe corona hit was amplified by timing.  Biotechs usually follow this pattern.\n\nA. FDA Approval = Shoot up then settle back down\n\nB. Dilution = Drop and then settle back up.\n\nCorona hit right at the bottom of the dilution stage and then the stock never had proper price discovery.\n\nAfter the initial chaos of corona I am of the opinion that traders and institutions are actively trying to keep the lid on things and don\u2019t want people to know about AGRX\n\nAGRX Flat\n\n[AGRX Flat. Is someone trying to keep a lid on things?](https://preview.redd.it/23p26qdks9951.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b00d6f921fe04ebf85d69249b0be2e9853e22c53)\n\nWhy?\n\n1. It\u2019s a great product with a sure fire pathway to profitability.\n\n2. It\u2019s one of the biggest buyout candidates in the Biotech space and a buyout could happen at any time.\n\n3.  It's small market with not a lot of float with current retail buying situation retail could come in a wreck their plans to squeeze every last dollar out of the stock over the next 6 months. (We should do this)\n\nAGRX is basically the golden egg of biotech stocks.  Possible buyout at any minute and even If no buyout this thing has a guaranteed pathway to success and is very undervalued.  We will discuss these points below.\n\n1. AGRX is undervalued and has a surefire pathway to success.\n\nA. AGRX is not the first patch for BC.  There is already a product called Xulane.  At one point Xulane has 11% of the market so we know women want and will buy a birth control patch. Unfortunately Xulane gave some women blood clots and surprise surprise people don\u2019t like blood clots. (This contributed to the the slow approval of Twirla) Xulane is sold for $140 a month currently and is still bought even with the increased blood clot risk because women really like this option.\n\nWhat is it worth? Pinning down the value of a biotech stock isn\u2019t easy and after doing some research the most uniform and logical valuation IMO is setting the market cap at yearly sales. So how much Twirla will AGRX sell a year?\n\nWe can look to Xulane for that. At it\u2019s peak Xulane had 11% of the market\n\n61 million women in [reproductive range](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states) in the US.  60% use some form of birth control. If Twirla did just half of what Xulane did before the bloodclots what kind of market are we talking about?\n\n61 Million (Reproductive women)\n\n60% amount of women who use some form of birth control\n\n36,000,000 potential Twirla Customers\n\n5.5% Twirla customers (Half of peak Xulane)\n\n1,800,000 million Twirla customers potentially.   \n\nOnly recently did Agile announce pricing. (One of the reasons it has traded flat for months is there has been very little news out of the AGRX camp another reason why a Buyout might be cooking) Pricing of Drugs is like pricing on cars just because the sticker says something it doesn\u2019t mean that is what it will sell for. Agile priced Twirla at $160 a month which is $20 more than Xulane (Small price to pay IMO for peace of mind when it comes to blood clots)\n\nI did some research with the App Good RX and I found that Xulane could be had for as cheap as $99 a month.  Lets apply a similar discount to Twirla and I am going to use $124 a month which is a significant discount of retail and a similar discount to Xulane. (When it\u2019s new it might not even trade at a discount I am just being conservative in my pricing.)\n\n1,800,000 Twirla customers at $124 a month is $2,678,400,400 Billion dollars a year in sales.\n\nThis is my prediction for the market cap of AGRX and it\u2019s product Twirla in 3 or so years = $2.67 Billion Market Cap\n\nCurrent Market Cap = $246 million. AGRX will be ready to go to market by Q4, by the time Twirla goes to market it is reasonable for AGRX as a company to be worth a billion dollars. ($1 Billion market cap is around a $10 share price) Remember AGRX is not inventing the wheel here.  This has all been done before with success but it all went away when the blood clot thing happened.\n\nIn my opinion AGRX could be trading just under $10 a share by Q4 and would be trading in the $7.xx plus range right now if the timing for Corona wasn\u2019t so bad for AGRX stock price.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Wild Card \\*\\*\\* I\u2019ve already discussed AGRX and the fact that I think it should trade in the $7.xx range now with the $9+ range by Q4. At any moment we could wake up to a buyout announcement and I think it could be coming and might be one of the reasons AGRX has had some really weird trading or the bast few months.\n\nBuyout Points of Interest\n\nAGRX current CFO is Dennis P Reilly.  He was also CFO of Barrier Therapeutics which was bought out by Steifel Labs.  If you look up insider trading data on Barrier Reilly had similar purchasing habits for Barrier right before it sold to Steifel. Humans are creatures of habit\n\nThere has been NO INSIDER buying or selling since March other than the exercising of options for employee compensation.  The last one being interesting the CEO exercised some long ago rewarded options that timing of is weird.  R[ecently exercised decade old compensation option](https://flashalert.me/?symbol=AGRX&amp;source=SEC&amp;referer=https://twitter.com/&amp;url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1261249/000110465920076109/xslF345X03/a4.xml&amp;s3=AGRX/2020-06-23/17-00-53_000000/4/2fe0d01c8e7553a65e2efaa2732c4b1d/a4.xml)   It\u2019s almost like they are trying to tie up any financial loose ends before being acquired. This is important for SEC insider trading guidelines. I believe no one is buying/selling because they know a BO may be in order and they don't want to get a knock on the door from the SEC\n\nCEO used to work for Johnson and Johnson and a few board members are ex JnJ executives.\n\nAgile Office space is up for [Lease](https://www.commercialcafe.com/commercial-property/us/nj/princeton/poor-farm-road-office-building/)\n\nCEO had a [Virtual Fireside Chat](https://www.barrons.com/press-release/agile-therapeutics-to-participate-in-virtual-fireside-chat-as-part-of-the-2020-rbc-capital-markets-global-healthcare-conference-on-wednesday-may-20-2020-01589227945?tesla=y&amp;tesla=y) during which he made a possible slip by saying \u201cIf\u201d we go to market.  Might be nothing but also might be the truth coming out\n\nBasically lots of insider activity that could point to a buyout and Twirla is a good candidate for a buyout as this type of product in a way is a known quantity.  A larger player like Johnson and Johnson could profit from Twirla faster than Agile could.\n\nUnlike many other \u201cBuyout candidates\u201d Agrx is a product with a proven desirability in the market.  If no buyout happens it is on the pathway to being a multi billion company in just a few years and is worth far more right now than it is currently trading for.\n\nIt\u2019s price has been suppressed by unique market conditions and over the past few months some very weird trading characteristics can be observed. It\u2019s owned by a lot of institutions and they keep adding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[It will be a lot more in Q2](https://preview.redd.it/pbzbqnxiv9951.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb5c69f94367f41669ccf7391e33812c1b7925b7)\n\n[Fund Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/uzjk4m62w9951.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08e2dbd922c63d5c777c886cc9876c07104f888)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Institutional Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/sfj8ecc5w9951.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e0af3d9cdb4b7443a98774e0d0a317a275f868c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Direct Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/4z5qtlg8w9951.png?width=1702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10c475e2a34ffa34f394f41392d933188a50893e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotice nobody is selling ONLY BUYING\n\nJust recently it had a 7 million share AH transaction.  Some people attributed this to it being included in the Russell but I reject that theory as it looks like no other stock that was added to the Russell that week had nearly as big of a block of AH transactions.  Something is up and someone knows something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Recent 7 Million AH trade, 11million on the day](https://preview.redd.it/hc7edx4cw9951.png?width=420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=456e779755a5ec324276d196a49a21522cf88e47)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found this interesting comment while doing research on weird AGRX trading over the past 2+ months\n\nQuote = \u201c6/26/20 mm\u2019s bought everything they could get their hands on at the laser straight bottom $2.83- added to existing inventory they could then fill that 7.3M \u201csell\u201d (emphasis) at $2.82-$2.85 right at market close- which btw conveniently topped at .002 (+-) under vwap. with their inventory depleted- how do they restock below the obvious support at $2.80? tree shake- send it to the 50 ma- keep it there for a few days while they steal cheap shares from anyone that doesn\u2019t know what they own. think about it- the day before being added to the indices, sitting at 6 weeks of proven support and well under any immediate resistance, with commercialization processes underway, cash in hand and niche product that will probably swallow the market\u201d END QUOTE\n\nAGRX has been trading weird for months.  It looks to me like some people know that a buyout could happen at any minute and even if BO does not come the stock is very undervalued so they just make more money with no buyout just not as fast.\n\n  \nBecause this stock is very closely held and not very often bought and sold by retail a few players that might be in the know have been able to keep a lid on things.  My goal of this DD is to blow that up and help fellow retail buyers profit from this awesome product and get in before the big boys squeeze every dime out of the situation.\n\nAGRX is only going to go up.  It will either be a bullet train or a rocketship but wither way we should be the ones profiting.\n\nSuggestions  \n\nShares = 101, 1001 or 10001 shares depending on your bankroll (More if you have a big bankroll use your best judgement. (80/20 Shares to options are a good play in my opinion)\n\nSmall bank rolls get at least 100 so you can sell covered calls once this thing stabilizes. Buy in multiples of 100 for this reason. 1000 to 10,000 shares is a great goal if you have the bankroll. AGRX has been \"Consolidating\" for months this thing is a spring ready to release.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AGRX ready to release it's potential](https://preview.redd.it/nezxz43cx9951.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=746c141134bf2ba27afa4b736f067e3b359a1601)\n\nOptions = Sept 18th $2.5 Call December 18th $2.5 call (Safe play)\n\nAny $5 option ranging from 7/17,  8/21, 9/18 these are basically BO lottery tickets as one day we might wake up to news that AGRX is being bought out from $750 million to $1.1 Billion dollars which corresponds to about a $9 to $11 share price.  The RUMOR I have heard is AGRX has been shopping a nearly $12 a share buyout and the only reason it hasn\u2019t happened is Corona uncertainty and $12 is steep. If they were willing to sell for less it would be sold and AGRX isn\u2019t in any hurry to sell as they know they have a product with legitimate demand in a large market. If buyout were to happen my guess is around $9.xx a share. I would legitimately buy shares up to that price through the year 2020\n\nAGRX don't miss the boat and sorry to the people trying to keep this thing quiet.",

        "selftext": "I am a college student who is interested in investing and am working on a summer project to make investing, specifically long-term investing in stocks, more accessible to the everyday person.\n\nAs part of this project, I wanted to brainstorm and breakdown companies using a simple, systemic framework that is easily understood and digested by beginners while still allowing them to see the bigger picture. It is not to learn about every single detail about a company, but to share/record relevant information for someone to invest for the long-term.\n\nThis framework consists of analyzing a company's competitive advantages (moats), potential, risks, and valuation.\n\nThis is probably common knowledge to you guys but I'm just going to breakdown the categories for consistency and clarity.\n\nMoats:\n\n* Low-cost producer Ex: Walmart can undercut the prices of local grocery stores because of their efficient supply system and the fact that they buy their products in bulk.\n* High Switching Costs: When switching from Apple products to Android products, it is notoriously difficult to transfer files and photos from one device to the other.\n* Network Effect: As more people join Facebook, the platform becomes more valuable because users now have more people to connect and interact with.\n* Intangible Assets: Brands, (patents, trademarks, and copyrights), government approvals, or a geographic advantage. Ex: Starbucks can charge a high price for its coffee products and thus make lots of profit because they can uphold their brand reputation so effectively.\n* Efficient Scale or toll moat: Only a few players can enter a market and be successful. Mastercard's competitors, namely Visa, have no interest in undercutting Mastercard as doing so would only hurt their profits and margins. Instead, they function in a healthy, stable\u00a0duopoly\u00a0to preserve their market share and profits. This grants high barriers to entry for any company trying to enter the payment network space.\n\nPotential:\n\nThis section is to be filled with various reasons that the company is expected to grow in the foreseeable future. This is great for identifying if a company seems to have the ability to grow for the long haul. Below are various categories/examples of potential:\n\n* Product Potential: If a company can continuously innovate and make revolutionary breakthroughs/innovations in their products. Ex: Tesla's cars are improving every year with better batteries and a self-driving system that makes itself better the more data it acquires.\n* Market Potential: If a company can expand its market to new horizons. Ex: The iPhone SE has allowed Apple to start making the iPhone more accessible to the middle class, effectively allowing them to access a new part of the cellular device market due to its lower price point.\n* Business Model Potential: Changing the business model to ensure that the company keeps its footing within the industry. Ex: Boeing transitioned from making the majority of their revenue selling aircraft to servicing/repairing them.\n\nRisks:\n\nVarious risks go along with any company, and I believe that correctly identifying and evaluating these can make or break whether a company is a worthy long-term investment or not. These risks can be broken up into two distinct categories: external and internal risks. That is, risks that happen outside of a company versus risks that come from within.\n\nA couple of external risk examples include:\n\n* Competition: Samsung went from having 20% marketshare in China vs. 1% in just five years because of the likes of huawei, xiaomi etc.   \n* Government Regulations and Restrictions: Since Lockheed-Martin, a private military contractor, has its biggest client as the US government, their revenue that comes internationally can come to a halt it the US government decides to sanction a country that makes up a significant portion of their international revenue.\n* Unforeseen Event Risk: COVID-19 has been detrimental to the majority of businesses. AMC theaters, for example, have forced AMC theaters to close all of their theaters until further notice, which has stopped all of their revenue.\n\nA couple of internal risk examples include:\n\n* High Debt: Since AT&amp;T has recently acquired both DirecTV and Time-Warner, they have a high amount of debt (around $160 billion) that will take a substantial amount of time to pay off, and it must be predicted whether or not they will pay it off.\n* Concentrated Revenue: Since around 50% of Apple's revenue comes from their iPhone sales, if their sales were greatly reduced, this would be detrimental to the company's revenue.\n\nValuation: Any methods/metrics that seem relevant plus an approximate margin of safety price\n\nHere is an example of my own breakdown on Apple:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr790iG6U3xQbUJ5sVKYRBXyhTVpQV\\_Sdkb5S55LbY0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr790iG6U3xQbUJ5sVKYRBXyhTVpQV_Sdkb5S55LbY0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**\\*** These categories (especially for potential and risks) are by no means the only ones available, and I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can think up of any other effective categories for any of the four company factors that I listed above. Also, is this system flawed and ineffective, and if so, how and where is it ineffective?**\\***\n\nThank you for reading this far. If you have any questions or if anything is unclear, don't hesitate to ask. I am openly looking for constructive criticism, so any sort of feedback will be extremely helpful. Or if you want to share something similar of your own I would love to get this thread going. :)",

It is possible that i am going to need that money in the autumn. \n\nWhat would you guys do? Should i sell them now at 295 or wait it out until I actually need the money. My concerns are that the election in the autumn and corona spikes might bring it down even more short term.",

I have already put 2k into WFC however a lot of you said it wasn\u2019t a really good option so Im going to sell that and try to diversify my portfolio. I am first going to go for good Growth stocks which i can hold onto long term and get a solid return. Haven\u2019t investing anything yet however I am mainly going for AMD, QCOMM, SPY, MA, BKNG, MSFT, APPL, AMZN, UPS.\n\nI am also considering going for high volatile stocks to get a quick return. For thus I am thinking of going for AUY, TSLA, PFE, and ARKK. Any tips would be appreciated.\n\nBtw im pretty young(under 20) so im just trying test things around.",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

Still new to investing (about a year) and only recently figured out I really need a plan and stick with it. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been sitting on a number of shares of VUG for about a year. More recently I decided i would focus on a core group of 5 stocks every month with Mastercard and Microsoft being a large part of this core (25% each). \n\nThe rest is in IRM, HK.3101 (VGK equivalent on HKSE) and then VUG + some spare cash to fool around with, with fool.com stock advisor picks. \n\nThis morning however i noticed that VUG consists of 9.86% MSFT and 1.87% MA. Seems a bit stupid to double expose oneself to these 2 so significantly. \n\nWhat are your feelings? Does it really matter that much? Are there better low-fee, growth ETFs?

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b02cd9a08b7fedd5996d544420d9cd8/cb70e70b199ba14d-04/s500x750/c8010183a653633c81747813512c8c74ed5214a2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$EBAY** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$AZN** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$CNC** \n&gt; * **$MO** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$GOOG** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$GILD**\n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$DXCM** \n&gt; * **$ABCB** \n&gt; * **$BUD** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$LRCX**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/kg5BG97Q/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 27TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR2gdg5q/eram01.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D2LRQ6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/C6Upp8Y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/O5wY9g7.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MjSLIaQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EictqLG.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XGrwuKt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HMjc0WJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0hMH94x.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vFJ1WH4.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7otjSsD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7g6UICu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FKHIibS.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/l21kL5q.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rrBxXn7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X4senHx.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KqxX8LC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3l48OVf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0VTb4f4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/deutsche-bank-considers-financial-support-for-wirecard-bank-kc4tsbnd\n\nDeutsche Bank AG is weighing the acquisition of all or part of disgraced Wirecard AG\u2019s bank, potentially throwing the business a lifeline after one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based lender is in touch with regulator BaFin, Wirecard Bank\u2019s management board and administrators on possible further steps to help Wirecard\u2019s finance unit, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said by e-mail, without elaborating. Options include taking on pieces of Wirecard Bank or the unit in its entirety, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the lender is still debating other ways to help Wirecard Bank and hasn\u2019t made a final decision.\n\nDeutsche Bank had informal tie-up talks with the scandal-hit fintech last Spring, though it quickly broke off the preliminary discussions. Wirecard Bank -- which sat at the heart of the firm -- could be valuable to a potential acquirer because of its relationship with credit card companies Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and JCB International, which are also key to other parts of Wirecard.\n\nDeutsche Bank may also be hit if Wirecard Bank were to file for insolvency. Germany\u2019s deposit insurance scheme for private banks would have to make depositors whole if the lender didn\u2019t have enough funds of its own to repay them. That could lead to higher contributions from the scheme members, of which Deutsche Bank is the biggest and highest paying.\n\nWirecard filed for insolvency last week after saying that almost 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) it previously reported as cash probably never existed, throwing the future of its banking and others businesses into doubt. The company faces a potential avalanche of lawsuits and former Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun was arrested, though he is now out on bail.\n\nWhile Wirecard Bank isn\u2019t part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the parent ceded control of funds last week after the financial regulator stepped in to prevent the money from being deployed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the possibility of providing Wirecard Bank AG with financial support,\u201d Deutsche Bank said. \u201cWe are in principle prepared to provide this support in the context of a continuation of business operations, if such assistance should become necessary.\u201d\n\nInsolvency administrator Michael Jaffe said on Wednesday that the assets he\u2019s trying to sell are attracting interest from numerous investors. He didn\u2019t say whether he intends to sell Wirecard Bank as well, though said the lender remains solvent.\n\nTo fuel its growth, Wirecard had been paying depositors attractive interest at a time when traditional banks increasingly started to pass on negative rates. This year, it began offering a 0.75% interest rate via its Boon app, betting that more deposits will translate into more payments via its systems and lucrative contracts with stores and online merchants.\n\nIn addition to the earlier talks on a possible tie-up, the two financial firms had others links. Deutsche Bank is part of a lending group of 15 banks that together are owed about 1.6 billion euros, Bloomberg has reported. CEO Christian Sewing has been trying to shift the lender away from its reliance on trading income toward a focus on processing payments for companies, and he\u2019s made the division responsible for the business -- known as Corporate Bank -- the centerpiece of his large restructuring plan.\n\nSewing has focused tech investment on the Corporate Bank but he has also said that the division is being challenged by the low interest-rate environment it\u2019s operating in.\n\nThe collapse of Wirecard has prompted criticism of regulators and soul-searching among Germany\u2019s elite grappling for answers over the failure of what was once one of its most lauded companies. BaFin President Felix Hufeld has acknowledged that his institution is among those to blame for not catching the irregularities, which he referred to as \u201cmassive fraud\u201d on Thursday in Frankfurt.",

        "selftext": "Most people cannot dedicate their lives to trading all of a sudden and need to ease into it while they maintain their personal and professional responsibilities. I wanted to provide something so people start making progress with their trading without having to invest money or too much time.\n\nI wrote this scan in about **5 minutes** on a **free website** that has a **great scanner** so **anyone can use** it on **any platform**. They have built in scans that are actually quite good and it one of the most powerful scanners that a lot of people I respect turned me on to. It's not pretty but its powerful.\n\nWhile this is a Daily scan and I will phrase this in terms of Daily and **Swing trading**, any of these results are prime candidates for **intraday trading** because they are stronger than the market and bullish with momentum. You can also use moving averages on a 5M chart in the exact same way. The same principals apply on any time frame. Swing trading is just much easier to start out with because the room for error is much more flexible.\n\nThe perfect moving average order is **5 SMA** over the **20 EMA** over the **50 SMA** over the **100 SMA** over the **200 SMA.** So when they are in this order, price is too high and we do not want to buy it. We want a pullback. Okay, everyone said **\"buy the dips\"** **\"buy low sell high\"**. That's big words with no help. It's easy to scan for stocks, but no one tells you how to trade them without paying them money.\n\n[https://chrt.biz/SHOP/1242586mifa/chart/](https://chrt.biz/SHOP/1242586mifa/chart/) These highlight areas show you what happens when price \"dips\" and tests a moving average. As long as they get back in the right order, price moves up, and with more **momentum** than usual.\n\nWe want the 200, 100 and 50 MA's to never change order, or its a sign of a **bearish reversal**. When **short moving averages cross over the longer ones, that's a sign of retreat**. Go short or get out.\n\nBut when they come back and cross to the upside, that's our trigger!\n\n**Here is the scan.**\n\n[https://www.stockfetcher.com/](https://www.stockfetcher.com/) Click **New Filter,** **Paste** the red text and **Find Stocks**\n\nShow stocks where the comparative relative strength(\\^SPX,90) is above 1.0 compare with \\^SPXand Average Volume(30) is above 500000and close &gt; 10and close &lt; 300and EMA(20) &gt; MA(50)and MA(50) &gt; MA(100)and MA(100) &gt; MA(200)and MA(5) &lt; EMA(20)and Close &gt; SMA(5)\n\nand Show MA(5)and Show EMA(20)and Show MA(50)and Show MA(100)and Show MA(200)\n\n1. We want stocks that are performing **stronger than the S&amp;P**\n2. We want stocks with **500k volume** minumum (I like 1M for intraday unless its a nanofloat with like 100k average and 500k would be 500%)\n3. **Price -** Set this to what you want. I don't recommend stocks under 10 unless you know what you are doing More money to be made, but smaller stocks behave differently at times. 15-100 would be good for a 5k-25k account. Smaller stocks have more potential to move. (except TSLA)\n4. We want the **200, 100 and 50 in order.**\n5. We want the **5 to have gone below the 20** showing a bearish move. **But**\n6. We want **price to have recovered above the 5 SMA** but **still below the 20EMA**. Because then the **20 cross back over the 5**. We get **upward price movement with momentum**.\n7. We do not want **any signs of the 20 crossing down the 50** or we have a **bearish trend**.\n\n**Bad**: Price below 20 and 20 about to cross 50. [https://chrt.biz/MRNA/12425861fc3/chart/](https://chrt.biz/MRNA/12425861fc3/chart/)\n\n**Good**: Price went below the 20 but totally rejected the 50. Very bullish sign and you can see how it gapped right over the 5 and 20 moving averages (not a coincidence). You can see the moving average labels in the order we want. [https://chrt.biz/BABA/1242585rych/chart/](https://chrt.biz/BABA/1242585rych/chart/)\n\n**Worse**: Price is moving down so fast that the 5 is going to cross the 50 before the 20. So where is price going to go? The 100 SMA [https://chrt.biz/WORK/1242585pzza/chart/](https://chrt.biz/WORK/1242585pzza/chart/)\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWe use all SMA's except the 20 (I use the 15 intraday). That is an EMA (weights heavier on more recent price than the tail, where the SMA is even - not that important)\n\nWe want the 100 over the 200. 50 over the 100. The 20 over the 50. The 5 BELOW the 20 BUT price RECOVERED above the 5 but still below the 20.\n\n**Master this first** then you can do more elaborate scans for better runners such as the 50 SMA retest.\n\nIf you see here, all the times the price did what I have detailed in this guide in blue:\n\n[https://chrt.biz/ZM/12425877qgm/chart/](https://chrt.biz/ZM/12425877qgm/chart/)\n\nAnd then look at green highlighted area. The bigger the retest without falling below, the bigger the recovery.\n\nAnd here is what happens when a giant mess of moving averages suddenly get in order:\n\n[https://chrt.biz/SHOP/1242586mifa/chart/](https://chrt.biz/SHOP/1242586mifa/chart/)\n\nI deliberately showed you two failures up there. That's trading. Most trades don't work out. You must learn proper risk management if you want to survive. You don't have to read any books or videos. Is price below the 5 SMA? Time to sell. Set an alert for the 20SMA and you can do it all over again.\n\n**Moving average order is the single most powerful tool you can learn** in any timeframe. It's on every platform. My 10 year old niece could understand it and draw it with crayons. Now trading it is the hard part, but this should hopefully get some people on the right path in realizing how simple trading can be. If you want complicated like I do, more power to you. But you can trade this after dinner, after a long day at work with orders ready to go in the morning. Put your stops in before work and check in a couple times during the day.\n\n**If you are in a bad trade you cannot be in a good trade. Wait for the good ones.**\n\n**Good luck. Be safe.**",

        "selftext": "I've been in the market for a little more than two years now, I haven't committed to it hugely but am trying to educate myself as I would like to make a more full time job out of trading. I felt that this sub was the best place to pose these questions. But before the questions I'll explain what I am doing. I trade mostly debit spreads but have started learning about credit spreads, I have a small account balance of ~$450, I never risk more than 15% of my total account balance on a single position and my risk/reward for every trade is 1/2, I utilize swing trading tactics, and have been trading weekly and two weeks until expiry contracts. Now my questions.\n\n1. I'm developing my strategy so that I hold my positions for 72 hours tops. When looking at a chart if I was to hold a position for one to two days while utilizing swing tactics. I currently check weekly, daily, 2hr, and 30min timeframes, but I know this is mudding my vision on trends and entry/exit with checking too many time frames. What would be the more favorable chart timeframes I should watch for holding positions for 1 to 3 days?\n\n2. I'm working on understanding how to screen for stocks that are more favorable to my strategy. I currently screen for large cap stocks above their 20/50 day MA. I screen for these because I want liquid positions that I can get in and out of easy and are also trending up. This is a more nuanced question but also ties a little bit into my next question, but what are some resources for better understanding how to screen for potential swing stocks or for momentum?\n3. I've focused on learning TA and price action for my strategy and have ignored fundamental analysis. When holding positions for the time frame that I am, is fundamental analysis useless or will it provide even just a slight edge to my strategy? And if it isn't negligible, what topics of fundamental analysis should I read up on for this type of strategy?\n\nI know I'm undereducated but I would appreciate any and all help on starting to develop my strategy from a rough draft to a semi-refined draft.",

The longer the duration the price spends on the trading range, the more significant the breakout of the channel will be.\n* The greater the expansion of volume during the point of breakout, the more bullish the signal is. The volume should be higher than in previous weeks.\n* The price must be above the 30-MA (Moving Average) in order to enter a buy position.\n\n**Secondary Criteria**\n\n* Mansfield Relative Strength should move from negative to positive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

        "selftext": "**Graf Industrial** $GRAF announced its plan to merge with a maker of laser sensors for self-driving vehicles, Velodyne Lidar. The business has good credentials with over 300 customers including Ford and Mercedes.  Following the merger Ford, Hyundai and Nikon will hold 80% of the stock.  The valuation at 18x revenues is not cheap and reflects 60% annual growth expectations.  Velodyne\u2019s impressive list of backers and customers gives credibility to those forecasts. \n\n**Micron**'$MU reported earnings  that beat expectations with sequential improvement and guided to growth next quarter. Revenues were up 13% while adjusted EPS grew 80%.  It\u2019s the first sequential improvement for six months and a good indicator that the memory chip cycle may be on the turn.  Chip manufacturers have been cutting capacity but now the 5G phone cycle is driving a big increase in DRAM and NAND bits per phone and the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles should also provide a boost.\n\n**My Size** $MYSZ, is a highly speculative mobile device measurement solutions provider for e-commerce fashion.  The company reported this week that two French retail brands, La Pi\u00e8ce and Habillez-moi, are integrating MySizeID into their e-commerce websites in order to increase customer loyalty and reduce returns. My Size offers online retailers innovative measurement and sizing solutions to reduce expensive returns triggered by size errors.  It\u2019s a high risk nanocap with a market capitalization of just $8 million yet has huge potential with its patent protected MySizeID solution that has been licensed by platforms, including Shopify and Lightspeed.  \n\n**Hepion Pharmaceuticals** $HEPA (WARNING SPECULATIVE EARLY STUDY NANO CAP)  jumped on Tuesday after reporting that it was \"exceedingly pleased\" that its CRV431 Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment continues to be very well tolerated throughout the entire Phase 1 program, which well positions Hepion for upcoming Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients.\n\nDr. Robert Foster, CEO of Hepion Pharmaceuticals has said that the drug candidate \"CRV431 offers a novel approach to the treatment of fibrosis caused by NASH and possibly other causes of liver injury,\".  He went on to add \"This is because CRV431 acts, in part, by directly targeting fibrotic scar formation by down-regulating an important regulator of collagen synthesis, cyclophilin B, thereby reducing collagen production. This contrasts with most other NASH drug candidates that target events such as dyslipidemia or diabetes that may lead to fibrosis. Combining the direct antifibrotic actions of CRV431 with the indirect actions of other drug candidates likely represents the best opportunity for rapidly and effectively decreasing liver fibrosis in NASH.\"\n\nThe global Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) market is expected to exceed US$20.0 Billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of more than 10.0% during the period from 2018-2025.  Hepion has a long way to go before approval or commercialization of its drug.  However, with a market cap of just $26 million, even a small chance of developing a successful treatment for such a large prize makes this an interesting stock.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",

Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n2. They already have the X series CPUs for those who want well binned chips / top silicon. \n3. The consumer CPU market for AMD is now showing long term potential as a profit puppy. \n\u2014\u2014\n[https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results)\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAMD has a strong potential to beat Q3 expected earnings. Why? Because their production has a solid chance of recovering by then. Why? Because they have a somewhat diversified access to memory, and the raw materials needed for production.\n\n[AMD](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/interest_coverage)\n\nAMD - has had a rough go of it, but it\u2019s starting to recover. Yes In the consumers minds, and it\u2019s starting to show in the numbers as well.\n\nDirectly from the post linked above regarding AMD earnings\n\nQ4 2019 Results\n\n\"Revenue of $2.13 billion was up 50 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue was up 18 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment partially offset by lower revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.\"\n\n^ Clearly this is the direction the company is headed in my opinion.\n\n*What are my price targets?\n\nI fully expect AMD to hit ATH of 70$ per share by Q4 or Q1 2021. Why? Because there is demand. Look at what this stock was in feb 2019 and then look at its peak before Covid. Compare that to its current price. See what I\u2019m getting at here?\n\nHas anyone seen the MU surge? Memory is in high demand. Specially flash NVME and SSDs. \n\nWhat does this mean for AMD?\nAMD is heavily dependent on companies like micron (TSMC, Samsung, etc) GDDR6, flash memory, and VRAM are all dependent on this sector.\n\nThe amount of improvement in the memory sector -is staggering. Flash Memory is finally \u201caffordable\u201d to most mid-range computing customers. At the least - far more improvement here than simply PUMPING more GHz into the same cores and SMT that INTC always does. \n\n\n-----\nTLDR: Everyone already hopped on their **** why does this matter now... so what?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. - I can\u2019t speak to how the current market trends will affect this stock in the very short term. \n\nThis is literally a power play - in my opinion - showing how they can adapt to a changing market and their literally competing with theirselves now (just like NVDA competes with itself on its own high end GPUs)",

I got in at mid march when things were lowest. I am still a bringer but i found that the covid crash plus all the money I had saved up seemed like a good time to start dabbling.\n\nright now i hold: BA- 4 shares NCHL 99 share, Apple 11 share, RCL 40share- got a really good deal on that, it was trading at near $130 and i got in a $45 ERl- 95 share-again thought this was a steal bc i bought in at 40 and it was trading in the $60 C- 16 shares SYY- 15 share\n\nI bought all these back in mid march along with 1.32 BTC\n\nI understand these are risky and. cruisline may not recover anytime soon so this could lose me a lot of money but im in a position in life which i an afford to take huge hit, so i can learn for next time. phase two of my goal is to reap the benefits of his sale I got with all these stocks-assuming they survive, allocating the money i made from them and use it for my real long term portfolio, which includes:\n\n FAANG -Apple, FB,(debating AMZn bc how expensive the price has gotten at this point, -MFST -Mu -AMD- although ive had a love hate relation shit with AMD -V -JNJ''\n\nwhat doe you guy think if my plan/portfolio effectively, Id like to bring the portfolio to list to 10 manageable companies which i can study in the ins and outs of these companies and mitigated the gambling associated with the list of stock I initially chose\n\nThanks or any and all feed back, Im still a science student in the inventive domain having shifted career path from physics and chemistry.\n\nAny help/brutal criticism is welcome!",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been managing my stock portfolio kinda randomly, some options some stocks buying on a whim and selling. I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my spreadsheet right now:\n\nNewer stars 2 yrs: SE, NET, CRWD, CHWY, FSLY, DDOG, TTD, ZS, TWLO, TEAM, SPLK, MDB, WORK, SHOP\n\nETFs: ARKK, ARKW, WCLD, QQQ\n\nPayments or Banks: SQ, PYPL, V, JPM, BAC \n\nBetting: GAN, DKNG, PENN\n\nChips: NVDA, AMD, MU\n\nEnergy: ENPH, NEE, PCG, FANG\n\nHealthcare: LVGO, TDOC, UNH, MOH, DHR, CATS, VEEV, MODN\n\nCovid: HOLX, NVAX, MRNA, INO, IBIO, AYTU, VBIV , TTOO\n\nEVs: TSLA, NIO, WKHS, FUV, GRAF, PLUG\n\nFANG stocks: MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB\n\nSocial/Entertain: PINS, NFLX, ROKU\n\nCyber: PANW, ZS, CRWD, NET, PING, FNET, FEYE\n\nBeaten down (1 year recovery): WYNN, LVS, DAL, LUV, STWD, SPG, CAR, MAR, RCL\n\nMy Options are:\n1) Invest $10K into 50 stocks since I can\u2019t choose with all the confusion\n2) Choose 15 stocks and invest $30K each or so \n3) Invest more % in couple categories above like the FANG stocks, ETFs, EVs, and less in others \n4) Buy 100 shares of 15 or so from the above list and sell covered calls getting ~$4K per week (but with the limited upside of covered calls, downside will be the same as holding) \n5) Stay 50% or more cash since the market could crash given the high valuations, pandemic and election year \n6) Something else that you\u2019d do in my shoes",

        "selftext": "This week we look at a bullish play in my favorite company in Idaho.  No, not ADM Edible Bean Specialties (Ticker: ADM), but the maker of computer memory, Micron (Ticker: MU).  Tried to find a potato joke, but clearly came up short \\[although the first half of one is at the bottom of the post...\\].  A 6 month chart shows that Micron has recovered much of the March COVID-19 drop, but not all: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[6 Month chart of MU](https://preview.redd.it/9stfq91qavb51.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=726b49ca5f9d5d9ce574b55a73d550c844d1a348)\n\nFurther, we see that historical volatility has come down significantly, but implied volatility remains a good deal higher (Make sure to look at the absolute value of IV as well).  To take advantage, we look to sell some options, in one of two ways:\n\n* Sell 21 August 42.5 puts for 0.51\n* Sell 21 August 45/42.5 put spreads for 0.40\n* Price is at the midpoint as of 7/17/2020\n* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.\n\nIf you want to consider MU as a long term holding, selling a cash secured put will get you in close to $42.  As a pure trade, the put spread offers a nice return on risk if the position expires worthless.  19% for a little over a month ($40/$210 = 19%).  \n\nThere are no earnings during this time frame, which is a benefit to this type of trade (we don't want movement).  \n\nOne risk, as with any placed while the world battles COVID-19, is an overall market drop that takes MU with it, much like what occurred in March.  Here are a couple ways you can offset some of this risk:\n\n* Sell a call spread, like the 55/57.5 for 0.36.  This requires MU to stay within the 45-55 range at expiration and one takes in a total of 0.76 (assuming the put spread is selected)\n* Maintain a smaller position size. Put on less spreads than normal to limit the overall risk to your account.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Better potato jokes than this \"What do you call a potato that has turned to the dark side?\" ....",

        "selftext": "None of my friends or family care but NVDA was one of the first trades I ever made (51 shares at $68). I cashed out my original investment at 140 a share, then a bit more at 270, then again at 360 and finally sold the remaining 12 shares I had today at 400 a share.\n\nThe valuation right now is too insane for me to continue to hold. While I love the company, there is no way that they should be ranked in the top 16 companies in the S&amp;P in terms of market cap. They did 3.1B in revenue last quarter compared to intel who did 33B. I wish all my fellow NVDA holders good luck in the future, but personally believe they are priced to perfection in this market.",

        "selftext": "These past few days/weeks, we've seen some truly absurd moves in tech. Today alone, Tesla was up 10 percent, Netflix was up 8 percent, and Amazon is up about 20% the past few weeks on basically no news. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, etc. are all at or above their mid-February valuations. What spooks me is not that these equities are moving upward, but it's that they are moving upward quickly and impulsively, with few pullbacks, and leaving the rest of the market in the dust. These are not the signs of a healthy new bull market; they are the signs of rampant speculation, euphoria, and greed. These mega-cap corporations are propping up the indices and are almost acting as safe havens for investors pulling out of travel, financials, consumer staples, energy, etc. We saw this rotation in full force yesterday when the Dow ended over -1% while the Nasdaq was around +0.5%. This is not to say that I think we are on the brink of collapse--bubbles can last a lot longer than any of us think they might.\n\nFor those of you who have exposure to big tech, how are you managing it? Are you planning to ride out what seems to be a massive, unstoppable wave upward or are you slowly taking profits along the way? How will upcoming earnings impact your strategy?",

How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology. (see below for a few examples)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey are the preferred OEM for Nvidia:\n\n[OSS Introduces the World's First and only PCIe 4.0 Expansion System for Nvidia.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oss-introduces-world-first-pcie-150010777.html)\n\n[OSS and Nvidia](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus)\n\n[Official PR from NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/worlds-top-system-makers-unveil-nvidia-a100-powered-servers-to-accelerate-ai-data-science-and-scientific-computing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nU.S. Military Defense:\n\n[OSS Military Defense, Navy, Air, and Ground forces.](https://www.onestopsystems.com/defense)\n\n[Latest Order from U.S. Navy](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/163/oss-orders-for-new-u-s-navy-ai-threat-detection-system-top)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAI Learning, DLSS, and Self-driving vehicles:\n\n[OSS Reveals World's First Solution for AI Learning that incorporates NVIDIA GPUs and ARM-based servers.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/19/1949447/0/en/OSS-Introduces-Industry-s-First-Solution-Incorporating-NVIDIA-GPUs-with-NVLink-and-Marvell-ThunderX2-Arm-based-Servers.html)\n\n[OSS AI on the Fly](https://www.onestopsystems.com/ai-on-the-fly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMachine Learning:[ OSS Machine Learning Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/machine-learning)\n\nMedical:[ OSS Medical Pre-built Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/medical)\n\nOil Industry:[ OSS Oil and Gas Industry Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/oil-and-gas)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are about a hundred more links, presentations, and conference calls that could be added to this post, but it would simply make it too long. *(We will be releasing follow up posts throughout the week to break up the information.)*\n\n$2 for a pennystock generating $60 million of revenue in its second year?\n\n$2 for a company that literally dominates an entire section of its industry?\n\n$2 for a company that is partnered with over 50+ major companies?\n\n$2 for a company that literally makes DOUBLE its ENTIRE MARKET CAP?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Vanguard increases their holdings by 103%, something's up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Further in-depth analysis will be posted tomorrow and throughout the week.)*\n\nA few of the topics to be covered are: product and competitor assessment, corporate presentations/conference calls, and financial breakdown.

I feel it is a responsibility to give back to the WSB community as I believe I have learned from others sharing their experience.\n\n\\#1: Pick only a few stocks to trade that you strongly believe they have a competitive edge over peers.\n\nFor me it was NVDA and COSTCO that paid off big for me. \n\n\\#2: You have to be disciplined. \n\nI bought COSTCO calls beginning of June and I actually lost about $40,000 as you can see from the dip in June. Thank God I stayed true and didn't sell. I had over 200 calls with different strike prices expiring all on 7/17/20 and I told myself I was going to hold until the June sales report.\n\n\\#3. Options trading is more luck and less analysis or acumen than stock investing. You have to time it right even if you picked winners. In the long run, I think it will be hard to continue winning. Get out while you're up.\n\n\\#4. Something I read from other posting on WSB: Don't fight the trend. The current trend is stonks only go up, brrrr. \n\nHappy gambling, poland out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n346lmy55v951.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d389fa7f62e945762ded15b1832de0ead57afd8c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd8yu0s25v951.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66015f699411cdff8656b54701d252e6e17af189",

        "selftext": "What\u2019s up fellow scallywag\u2019s, it\u2019s ya boy Swaggy with an update on some unusual options activity caught at the end of last week. Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

Just dig it up in my history.\n\nThere's profit-taking and sector rotation and then there is collapse. The first is a very healthy trim of the froth that built up over the past few months. Investors are simply reallocating the profitable portions of their book to previously avoided sectors to participate in their anticipated rise.  Collapse is when everybody, and I mean everybody, sell absolutely everything, even at deep losses just to get out.\n\nRight now, we are seeing a measured and controlled trimming.  Short-term cash might move over to tradeable opportunities in the non-tech space for a few weeks, maybe even just days but the US economy is an absolute mess right now. There are truly only two smart positions, well-establish tech equity and cash. It will flow back into tech at a discount.  The same people selling are the same people buying back at a 20% discount.\n\nI've got no advice for you if you're rolling dice with P&amp;Ds, buying bankrupt companies or flipping ridiculously short-term options but if you're like most people here, buying companies because they make sense over a longer time horizon and especially in a post Covid world (if that's even possible), the next few days or weeks will not matter after a few months.\n\nSo what do I currently own?\n\n30% cash, PFE, WMT, MSFT, AMZN, AMD, NVDA, GOOG, AAPL and TSLA.  All are still substantially in the green. I've trimmed about 25% of all positions last week and move over the cash. VIX is currently at 28.  In March, it was 80.   \n\nSo folks, it's cool.

        "selftext": "  \n\nMy fellow bulls, this is my first DD which gives this a 100% chance success rate. I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet. While you guys spent $85 watching grown men hug in an island for hours, I spent my time securing tendies for you. TSM is the play to make next week and here\u2019s why:\n\nTSM $64\n\nTSM is the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and produces for Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, and Huawei. They do more than just this but I suggest doing your own research as I promised to keep this short and sweet. They are in a great position financially and have recently reported revenue in June of 40% increase over the last year and a 28% increase from the previous month. Obviously 5G stocks have been mooning, and although TSM will not be responsible for creating the technology, they will likely be the company producing those 5G chips. On top of this, Merica\u2019s government is paying TSM to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM produces chips for the U.S. F-35 jet. Setting up a plant in the U.S. will make it much easier for future productions of any military related needs, as they have less restrictions to worry about. \n\nAside from all of that, TSM has also recently agreed to the world\u2019s largest corporate green power purchase agreement. WTF does this mean? Well this purchase gives them ownership of some of the world\u2019s largest wind farms. Their goal is to be a 100% renewable energy operated company. Why the fuck does this matter? Besides it making this world a safer and healthier blah blah blah, it is a nice PR move. People love this kind of shit and it will definitely shed positive light into the company. More importantly, major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, are part of the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100). In the future TSM may be the supplier of this renewable energy to these major companies. \n\nAnd for those of you who care, the technicals on this are very bullish. It is not overbought nor is it oversold and the MACD crossover is signaling buy. I\u2019d say we hit at least $70 by EOW. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF](https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF)\n\nAll the \u201cfinancial experts\u201d rate this as a great buy. Earnings will also be released 07/16 pre market. This is not an earnings play but regardless they are expected to beat their estimated earnings. I will be getting shares Monday and buying 08/28 $70c and 01/15/21 $80C. I will post proof of positions on Monday or as the kids say nowadays\u2026. BAN",

        "selftext": "Right now, there's a lot going on. We're at the start of a horrible earnings season. Tension between US and China. US Elections coming up between a crazy guy and a senile guy. So many companies are extremely overvalued. \n\nSo what do you think of the situation. Are you getting your money out? Are you spending it all and make decisions when something happens? Lowering your positions and hold a big cash position for a new crash / recession?\n\nIn my case, I was thinking about selling before elections and see how the consequences of the crisis would pay out. It's great that the Fed lends all that money, but it has to be paid off at some point as well. With lowered revenue and higher costs for adapting to the virus along with the stock market being this overvalued, I could see recession coming up.\n\nBut that would be timing the market, cause I would buy again at some point. That's why I decided to rearrange my portfolio a bit, focussing on small-mid cap companies with steady financials, active in growing sectors (web services, AI, digitalization of healthcare, fintech,...) and preferably IPO'd in the last 2 years. Those stocks wont fall that hard and would rebound pretty quick, so I'm pretty well set up  holding for the next decade.\n\nCompanies like TSLA and NVDA are very high on my watchlist, they are the future imo. But there's no way I could buy into them right now at this valuation. They would get hit way too hard if the bubble breaks. I'm kinda dividing my watchlist into two sides. The ones buying right now and the ones to buy during a crash or not buy at all cause I've missed the boat.",

It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures. The business pays their customers well which in turn results in supreme customer service and care.\n\n [https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/](https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/) \n\n\\- **Berkshire.B - QUALITY BUSINESSES**\n\nBerkshire.B is selected for similar reasons to Costco. I'm excited for Abel's leadership in the 21st century and they're simply an elegant long term investment with respects to quality business selection.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio) \n\n\\- **XLB Materials ETF - PROCESS ENGINEERING**\n\nXLB has an excellent selection of dominant businesses with respects to their industry like Sherwin-Williams, Linde PLC, and Ecolab.\n\n [https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings](https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings) \n\n\\- **Tesla - FUTURE MANUFACTURING**\n\nTesla is interesting as it develops robust applications and development of EV batteries, battery solutions, industrial automation and is helmed by a person who is able to mine engineering resources and relationships from SpaceX.\n\n [https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/](https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/) \n\n\\- **AMD - COMPUTING ACCESSIBILITY**\n\nI feel that the name of the game for AMD is the ability to reduce energy costs and low the cost of computing. They have been excelling at this for years now and I believe this patience will pay off enormously as AMD conquers the maintenance of data centers around the world.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/)",

Every full-home console from 2013 (Xbox one, One S, One X, Ps4, PS4 slim, Ps4 pro) a PLUS THE ENTIRE \u201cnext-gen\u201d console market. AMD APUs have literally ZERO competition unless you consider the NVidia Tegra X1 (the custom APU in the Nintendo switch) \\*PC gaming specifically - AMD DOMINATES the multi core market. This would appeal to consumers who like to play games... but also productivity / and or streaming / and or video editing etc\n\n\\*FINAL fundamental note - You can\u2019t compare an AMD stock present against its speculative potential without mentioning both NVDA &amp; INTC\n\nLETS GET STARTED\n\n\\*Evidence - (Fine. If you insist - I\u2019ll back up my thoughts with some [Graphs](https://imgur.com/gallery/x0UiCyl))\n\nReferenced TICKERS AMD +69% on the year (lol) NVDA +145% on the year INTC +23% on the year (disappointing due to its previous trajectory)\n\nSPECULATION \\*AMDs poor relative performance to NVDA (GPU market) can directly be correlated to two things\n\n1. The lack of a high performance GPU. NONE of amds current line-up (remember we have a future generation coming but the current gen is lackluster for high performance.\n2. Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n3. Price to performance ratio is not great on their GPUs but is EXCEPTIONAL on the Ryzen platform I admit\n\nNVDA has the RTX 2000 series (we won\u2019t compare the GPUs that haven\u2019t been officially announced yet from these two companies) \u2014\u2014 \\*NVDA - how is it up so much?\n\n1. Market Leader\n2. Strong leadership under CEO Jensen Huan(probably spelled that wrong sorry I\u2019m a lazy shit sometimes)\n3. High performance and \u201cattempts\u201d at a budget GPU option.\n\nRTX 2060 super cards allow gamers to build a \u201cbeast\u201d of a PC these days for -under 1500$\n\n[Proof](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mstbPn) \\^ under penalty of permanent BAN I swear to WS gods I put that list together in under 2 minutes. THATS how easy it is to build a pc in this modern era. \u2014\u2014 And finally INTC\n\n1. Dominated the entire sector as a market leader for 7 years. See Core i \u201cgen\u201d CPUS. From sandy bridge to Kaby lake - this company was at the top.\n2. Gained momentum because AMDs FX serious sucked bro\n3. Name recognition. Has your mom heard of intel before? It\u2019s quite possibly. AMD? Less likely. \u2014- Conspiracy level speculation? Okay here it is: NVDA could be a market leader in self driving cars. This could put them in direct competition with TSLA.\n\nTLDR: So what are the plays bitch?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. I have a long position of at least 10 shares with them. I\u2019d have to check my other brokers to give an exact number.\n\nNVDA - Why aren\u2019t you buying this stock? Have you looked at the charts? I can go to war defending this company\u2019s stock price.\n\nINTC - Fuck! Before Covid this was a definite buy. If INTC continues to grow it\u2019s market share in the APU, CPU, and GPU markets this company could be fucked in 5+ years or so. Trade at your own caution - but I\u2019m BUYING.",

It\u2019s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&amp;P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.

We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI\n\nOur Discord Forum link is on the video description..\n\nSECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off \u201c10\u20192 of thousands of employees.\u201d  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it\u2019s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don\u2019t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We\u2019ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP\u2019s to the averages.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -.67, BGS +.70, FLO -.03, CPB -.11, CAG +.54, MDLZ -.22, KHC +.22, CALM +.03, JJSF -1.43, SAFM +.54, HRL -.14, SJM +.18, PPC -.34, KR -.03, and PBJ $31.56 +.06 (.19%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB - -1.72, ABBV +.72, REGN +14.50, ISRG -9.30, GILD -.13, MYL -.43, TEVA -.29, VRTX +8.35, BHC -.59, INCY +.86, ICPT -.74, LABU +3.36, and IBB $140.15 +.71 (.51%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.13, CGC -.40, CRON -.19, GWPH +2.93, ACB +.17, CURLF -.07, KERN -.62 and MJ $13.08 -.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -8.59, GD -3.29, TXT -1.73, NOC -7.89, BWXT -1.78, TDY \u2013 7.84, RTX -2.12 and ITA $160.32 -6.10 (3.67%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.03, JWN -.58, KSS -.72, DDS -.88, WMT +9.11 (7.66%), TGT -1.40, TJX -1.84, RL -2.49, UAA -.41, LULU -6.66, TPR -.51, CPRI -.18 and XRT $43.78 -.43 (.97%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -7.40, AMZN -44.69, AAPL +1.06, FB -.91, NFLX +.69, NVDA +3.06, TSLA +9.42, BABA -2.60, BIDU -4.54, CMG -10.92, CAT -2.03, BA -8.57, DIS -.53 and XLK $106.34 -.77 (.72%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS \u2013 7.91, JPM2.52, BAC -.63, MS -1.32, C -1.53, PNC -3.15, AIG -1.36, TRV -2.45, AXP -3.48, V -3.13, and XLF $22.93 -.48 (2.05%).\n \nOIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

It has been very successful over the last 4 months but I'm afraid I may be missing something because it seems too easy so far which means it's very likely I'm doing something that is overly risky or misunderstood. I get that this is a great market but I'm trying to get honest feedback as to whether this is a dangerous or simplistic strategy in \"normal\" markets. What I'm doing:  \nSelling puts typically at only 1 or 2 week DTE at a delta of between 8 and 15 with an IV between 40 and 100. I only sell at a probability of profit +80% and a minimum of 20% annualized return- with the short duration it can be much higher. I also try to find good support levels to set my strike under and select stocks in a strong uptrend. My win rate has been over 95% as far as having to roll.  \nFor example today I sold a NVDA $380 put for this Friday for $1.00 at a -12 delta and a POP of 89%. So it seems like a solid likelihood I can make it three days without it dropping ITM.  \nWhat's wrong with this deep OOTM and very short DTE strategy? I understand many people go 20-45 days at a higher delta which just seems to a noob like me that it's a long time for something to go wrong but I might be thinking of that the wrong way. Experienced traders I respect seem to focus on 30-45 days DTE at a higher delta like 30- has that strategy been shown to have a higher expectancy? Is the use of such a short DTE overly risky?\n\n  \nThanks in advance for any guidance,",

Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n2. They already have the X series CPUs for those who want well binned chips / top silicon. \n3. The consumer CPU market for AMD is now showing long term potential as a profit puppy. \n\u2014\u2014\n[https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results)\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAMD has a strong potential to beat Q3 expected earnings. Why? Because their production has a solid chance of recovering by then. Why? Because they have a somewhat diversified access to memory, and the raw materials needed for production.\n\n[AMD](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/interest_coverage)\n\nAMD - has had a rough go of it, but it\u2019s starting to recover. Yes In the consumers minds, and it\u2019s starting to show in the numbers as well.\n\nDirectly from the post linked above regarding AMD earnings\n\nQ4 2019 Results\n\n\"Revenue of $2.13 billion was up 50 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue was up 18 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment partially offset by lower revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.\"\n\n^ Clearly this is the direction the company is headed in my opinion.\n\n*What are my price targets?\n\nI fully expect AMD to hit ATH of 70$ per share by Q4 or Q1 2021. Why? Because there is demand. Look at what this stock was in feb 2019 and then look at its peak before Covid. Compare that to its current price. See what I\u2019m getting at here?\n\nHas anyone seen the MU surge? Memory is in high demand. Specially flash NVME and SSDs. \n\nWhat does this mean for AMD?\nAMD is heavily dependent on companies like micron (TSMC, Samsung, etc) GDDR6, flash memory, and VRAM are all dependent on this sector.\n\nThe amount of improvement in the memory sector -is staggering. Flash Memory is finally \u201caffordable\u201d to most mid-range computing customers. At the least - far more improvement here than simply PUMPING more GHz into the same cores and SMT that INTC always does. \n\n\n-----\nTLDR: Everyone already hopped on their **** why does this matter now... so what?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. - I can\u2019t speak to how the current market trends will affect this stock in the very short term. \n\nThis is literally a power play - in my opinion - showing how they can adapt to a changing market and their literally competing with theirselves now (just like NVDA competes with itself on its own high end GPUs)",

        "selftext": "Hi Folks!\n\nLong post but bear with me. I had a Motif Investing account which I opened in 2016. For those who don't know, Motif used to offer theme based investing (for instance Cloud Computing was a theme). I had a 4-5 themes and each theme had a bunch of stocks each.\n\nFast forward to this year, Motif sent me an email that they were being sold to Folio Investing and that they have a monthly fee of 19.99 per month. I used to pay a small fee on Motif for free stock advisories in different themes and free rebalancing. They also had free individual stock trading which I used instead of Robinhood. However, I decided the 20 dollar monthly fee was too much for my \\~40k portfolio in Motif. So I called Vanguard and had them initiate a rollover. I have most of the rest of my portfolio with them and very happy so far. It went well except, Vanguard doesn't do fractional shares that Motif did. So eventually Motif had to liquidate all the fractional shares before rolling over the account complete. I didn't mind that either coz I have a good chunk of Tax loss Harvesting done in March this year when shit hit the fan. \n\nNow my question is, what do I do with the individual stocks in my Vanguard account? Here are the companies I own - \n\nABB, ABBV, ABT, ADM, AFL, ALB. ALL, AMCR, AMD, AME, AMOT, AMZN, AOS, ATVI, BABA, BEN, BILI, BRKS, CGNX, CMCSA, CVX, DEO, DIS, EA, EMR, EVRI, EXPD, FTI, GLUU, GPC, HEI, HLX, IGT, IRBT, IRM, ISRG, JNJ, LEG, LMNX, MDT, MG, MITK, MSFT, NFLX, NICE, NTES, NUE, NVDA, OMCL, ON, PBCT, PH, PPG, RXN, SCPL, SE, SGMS, SNE, SOHU, T, TER, TJX, TM, TRV, TTWO, TXT, UBER, UL, V, VNE, WB, WBA, XOM, ZNGA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother piece of information - I am sitting on a gain on the total but there are certainly losers in there. I know it is a lot of information to parse through. But is there any advice on how to consolidate this? My investing philosophy has evolved and I have most of my money in low cost index funds now and would prefer to do that for this piece of my portfolio as well.

UPS also gained 2.9% and between them they added 120 point to the average but still couldn\u2019t keep the average in positive territory.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -.53, BGS -.08, FLO -.11, CPB -.32, CAG +.50, MDLZ -.05, KHC -.21, CALM -.54, JJSF -2.80, SAFM -3.21, HRL -.83, SJM -.59, PPC -.15, KR -.20, and PBJ $31.06 -.17 (.54%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB -3.44, ABBV +1.22, REGN -15.55, ISRG +5.71, GILD -.94, MYL -.23, TEVA -.82, VRTX -3.31, BHC +.13, INCY -1.32, ICPT -1.41, LABU +.59, and IBB $137.80 +1.11 (.81%).\n \nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with TLRY -.06, CGC +.25, CRON +.05, GWPH +3.53, ACB -.18, CURLF +.06, KERN -.16, and MJ $12.98 +.11 (.85%).\n\n \nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -3.92, GD -.86, TXT -.77, NOC +.70, BWXT -.18, TDY -6.76, RTX -.01, and ITA $163.19 -1.53 (.93%)\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M -.26, JWN -.29, KSS -.63, DDS -.94, WMT -.23, TGT -.93, TJX +.64, RL -1.85, UAA -.12, LULU -2.82, TPR -.33, CPRI -.37, and XRT $43.06 +.18 (.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +23.95, AMZN +122.28 (4.43%), AAPL -.69, FB +10.03, NFLX +31.96, NVDA +1.49, TSLA +58.18 (5.39%), BABA +.60, BIDU +.91, CMG +17.52, CAT +.07, BA -1.85, DIS +1.45, and XLK $104.66 +.17 (.16%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -.12, JPM -.64, BAC -.44, MS -.74, C -.70, PNC -2.38, AIG -1.55, TRV -1.65, AXP -.84, V +.50, and XLF $22.94 -.20 (.86%).\n \n \nOIL, $39.82 +.55. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied midday. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. The stocks were higher with XLE $36.93 -.92 (2.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,779.30 -20.60. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

NIO, VSLR, just to name a few. Its a frustrating time because you invest in a few things for short term, and a few things for long term. What are you looking at for some useful information? I dont mean websites telling me to invest into Amazon, Disney, Microsoft, NVDA, Apple etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits a rough feeling seeing a stock at $6 last week, and double that today. We all see it, but then realize we didn't see it in time. Thats what i've been doing and im just chasing my tail looking at it going....well NOW do I invest? I know nobody has the right answer, but companies with a strong future are good investments. COVID isnt going anywhere anytime soon, so my MGM stocks will have to sit there for now. Election coming up, microsoft releasing info in a weekish, more iphones and more online shopping (seriously who got rich off overstock's...stock). Research forever, or buy apple and disappear for 10 years? My late night rant.",

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.**\n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.\n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade. Mexico is part of a puzzle that fits in a large scope that involves other bulwark nations like Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[Bulwark Trading Nations\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[The North American Trade Block\\]([https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Mexico is a nation in crisis. The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

        "selftext": "Hello, new investor here, I just started back in February right before the hit when everything was at it's highs. I had about $3000 invested into individual stocks like TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, etc but I unfortunately had to sell most of those a few weeks ago to pay bills because I am currently furloughed and it took me 15 weeks to get unemployment from the state of Florida. I also have $1500 in a Fidelity Roth that is split between FZROX, FZILX, and FXNAX.. which is still down. I also bought into my ESPP this year with Hilton so I probably should of sold some of that instead of the other ones but I was hoping to hold it at least for the two years to get the tax break. Anyways, I finally got all the unemployment owed to me in lump sums so I'm going to be ok for awhile and would like to reinvest at least half of it. I'm not sure if I should just stick with my Roth right now until it's maxed out or if I would be better in individual stocks at the moment. The 1500 was in my 2019 Roth so I think I have to start fresh with my 2020 one now so not sure if that would still help to maybe dollar cost average FZROX down?\n\nAny advice/recommendations/suggestions will be greatly appreciated!",

I cashed out my original investment at 140 a share, then a bit more at 270, then again at 360 and finally sold the remaining 12 shares I had today at 400 a share.\n\nThe valuation right now is too insane for me to continue to hold. While I love the company, there is no way that they should be ranked in the top 16 companies in the S&amp;P in terms of market cap. They did 3.1B in revenue last quarter compared to intel who did 33B. I wish all my fellow NVDA holders good luck in the future, but personally believe they are priced to perfection in this market.",

        "selftext": "These past few days/weeks, we've seen some truly absurd moves in tech. Today alone, Tesla was up 10 percent, Netflix was up 8 percent, and Amazon is up about 20% the past few weeks on basically no news. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, etc. are all at or above their mid-February valuations. What spooks me is not that these equities are moving upward, but it's that they are moving upward quickly and impulsively, with few pullbacks, and leaving the rest of the market in the dust. These are not the signs of a healthy new bull market; they are the signs of rampant speculation, euphoria, and greed. These mega-cap corporations are propping up the indices and are almost acting as safe havens for investors pulling out of travel, financials, consumer staples, energy, etc. We saw this rotation in full force yesterday when the Dow ended over -1% while the Nasdaq was around +0.5%. This is not to say that I think we are on the brink of collapse--bubbles can last a lot longer than any of us think they might.\n\nFor those of you who have exposure to big tech, how are you managing it? Are you planning to ride out what seems to be a massive, unstoppable wave upward or are you slowly taking profits along the way? How will upcoming earnings impact your strategy?",

How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology.

I feel it is a responsibility to give back to the WSB community as I believe I have learned from others sharing their experience.\n\n\\#1: Pick only a few stocks to trade that you strongly believe they have a competitive edge over peers.\n\nFor me it was NVDA and COSTCO that paid off big for me. \n\n\\#2: You have to be disciplined. \n\nI bought COSTCO calls beginning of June and I actually lost about $40,000 as you can see from the dip in June. Thank God I stayed true and didn't sell. I had over 200 calls with different strike prices expiring all on 7/17/20 and I told myself I was going to hold until the June sales report.\n\n\\#3. Options trading is more luck and less analysis or acumen than stock investing. You have to time it right even if you picked winners. In the long run, I think it will be hard to continue winning. Get out while you're up.\n\n\\#4. Something I read from other posting on WSB: Don't fight the trend. The current trend is stonks only go up, brrrr. \n\nHappy gambling, poland out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n346lmy55v951.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d389fa7f62e945762ded15b1832de0ead57afd8c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd8yu0s25v951.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66015f699411cdff8656b54701d252e6e17af189",

Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

        "selftext": "I'm going to leave out the obligatory background bit about why my two cents might be helpful.  Just dig it up in my history.\n\nThere's profit-taking and sector rotation and then there is collapse. The first is a very healthy trim of the froth that built up over the past few months. Investors are simply reallocating the profitable portions of their book to previously avoided sectors to participate in their anticipated rise.  Collapse is when everybody, and I mean everybody, sell absolutely everything, even at deep losses just to get out.\n\nRight now, we are seeing a measured and controlled trimming.  Short-term cash might move over to tradeable opportunities in the non-tech space for a few weeks, maybe even just days but the US economy is an absolute mess right now. There are truly only two smart positions, well-establish tech equity and cash. It will flow back into tech at a discount.  The same people selling are the same people buying back at a 20% discount.\n\nI've got no advice for you if you're rolling dice with P&amp;Ds, buying bankrupt companies or flipping ridiculously short-term options but if you're like most people here, buying companies because they make sense over a longer time horizon and especially in a post Covid world (if that's even possible), the next few days or weeks will not matter after a few months.\n\nSo what do I currently own?\n\n30% cash, PFE, WMT, MSFT, AMZN, AMD, NVDA, GOOG, AAPL and TSLA.  All are still substantially in the green. I've trimmed about 25% of all positions last week and move over the cash. VIX is currently at 28.  In March, it was 80.   \n\nSo folks, it's cool.

        "selftext": "  \n\nMy fellow bulls, this is my first DD which gives this a 100% chance success rate. I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet. While you guys spent $85 watching grown men hug in an island for hours, I spent my time securing tendies for you. TSM is the play to make next week and here\u2019s why:\n\nTSM $64\n\nTSM is the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and produces for Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, and Huawei. They do more than just this but I suggest doing your own research as I promised to keep this short and sweet. They are in a great position financially and have recently reported revenue in June of 40% increase over the last year and a 28% increase from the previous month. Obviously 5G stocks have been mooning, and although TSM will not be responsible for creating the technology, they will likely be the company producing those 5G chips. On top of this, Merica\u2019s government is paying TSM to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM produces chips for the U.S. F-35 jet. Setting up a plant in the U.S. will make it much easier for future productions of any military related needs, as they have less restrictions to worry about. \n\nAside from all of that, TSM has also recently agreed to the world\u2019s largest corporate green power purchase agreement. WTF does this mean? Well this purchase gives them ownership of some of the world\u2019s largest wind farms. Their goal is to be a 100% renewable energy operated company. Why the fuck does this matter? Besides it making this world a safer and healthier blah blah blah, it is a nice PR move. People love this kind of shit and it will definitely shed positive light into the company. More importantly, major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, are part of the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100). In the future TSM may be the supplier of this renewable energy to these major companies. \n\nAnd for those of you who care, the technicals on this are very bullish. It is not overbought nor is it oversold and the MACD crossover is signaling buy. I\u2019d say we hit at least $70 by EOW. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF](https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF)\n\nAll the \u201cfinancial experts\u201d rate this as a great buy. Earnings will also be released 07/16 pre market. This is not an earnings play but regardless they are expected to beat their estimated earnings. I will be getting shares Monday and buying 08/28 $70c and 01/15/21 $80C. I will post proof of positions on Monday or as the kids say nowadays\u2026. BAN",

        "selftext": "Right now, there's a lot going on. We're at the start of a horrible earnings season. Tension between US and China. US Elections coming up between a crazy guy and a senile guy. So many companies are extremely overvalued. \n\nSo what do you think of the situation. Are you getting your money out? Are you spending it all and make decisions when something happens? Lowering your positions and hold a big cash position for a new crash / recession?\n\nIn my case, I was thinking about selling before elections and see how the consequences of the crisis would pay out. It's great that the Fed lends all that money, but it has to be paid off at some point as well. With lowered revenue and higher costs for adapting to the virus along with the stock market being this overvalued, I could see recession coming up.\n\nBut that would be timing the market, cause I would buy again at some point. That's why I decided to rearrange my portfolio a bit, focussing on small-mid cap companies with steady financials, active in growing sectors (web services, AI, digitalization of healthcare, fintech,...) and preferably IPO'd in the last 2 years. Those stocks wont fall that hard and would rebound pretty quick, so I'm pretty well set up  holding for the next decade.\n\nCompanies like TSLA and NVDA are very high on my watchlist, they are the future imo. But there's no way I could buy into them right now at this valuation. They would get hit way too hard if the bubble breaks. I'm kinda dividing my watchlist into two sides. The ones buying right now and the ones to buy during a crash or not buy at all cause I've missed the boat.",

It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures. The business pays their customers well which in turn results in supreme customer service and care.\n\n [https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/](https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/) \n\n\\- **Berkshire.B - QUALITY BUSINESSES**\n\nBerkshire.B is selected for similar reasons to Costco. I'm excited for Abel's leadership in the 21st century and they're simply an elegant long term investment with respects to quality business selection.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio) \n\n\\- **XLB Materials ETF - PROCESS ENGINEERING**\n\nXLB has an excellent selection of dominant businesses with respects to their industry like Sherwin-Williams, Linde PLC, and Ecolab.\n\n [https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings](https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings) \n\n\\- **Tesla - FUTURE MANUFACTURING**\n\nTesla is interesting as it develops robust applications and development of EV batteries, battery solutions, industrial automation and is helmed by a person who is able to mine engineering resources and relationships from SpaceX.\n\n [https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/](https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/) \n\n\\- **AMD - COMPUTING ACCESSIBILITY**\n\nI feel that the name of the game for AMD is the ability to reduce energy costs and low the cost of computing. They have been excelling at this for years now and I believe this patience will pay off enormously as AMD conquers the maintenance of data centers around the world.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/)",

The lack of a high performance GPU. NONE of amds current line-up (remember we have a future generation coming but the current gen is lackluster for high performance.\n2. Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n3. Price to performance ratio is not great on their GPUs but is EXCEPTIONAL on the Ryzen platform I admit\n\nNVDA has the RTX 2000 series (we won\u2019t compare the GPUs that haven\u2019t been officially announced yet from these two companies) \u2014\u2014 \\*NVDA - how is it up so much?\n\n1. Market Leader\n2. Strong leadership under CEO Jensen Huan(probably spelled that wrong sorry I\u2019m a lazy shit sometimes)\n3. High performance and \u201cattempts\u201d at a budget GPU option.\n\nRTX 2060 super cards allow gamers to build a \u201cbeast\u201d of a PC these days for -under 1500$\n\n[Proof](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mstbPn) \\^ under penalty of permanent BAN I swear to WS gods I put that list together in under 2 minutes. THATS how easy it is to build a pc in this modern era. \u2014\u2014 And finally INTC\n\n1. Dominated the entire sector as a market leader for 7 years. See Core i \u201cgen\u201d CPUS. From sandy bridge to Kaby lake - this company was at the top.\n2. Gained momentum because AMDs FX serious sucked bro\n3. Name recognition. Has your mom heard of intel before? It\u2019s quite possibly. AMD? Less likely. \u2014- Conspiracy level speculation? Okay here it is: NVDA could be a market leader in self driving cars. This could put them in direct competition with TSLA.\n\nTLDR: So what are the plays bitch?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. I have a long position of at least 10 shares with them. I\u2019d have to check my other brokers to give an exact number.\n\nNVDA - Why aren\u2019t you buying this stock? Have you looked at the charts? I can go to war defending this company\u2019s stock price.\n\nINTC - Fuck! Before Covid this was a definite buy. If INTC continues to grow it\u2019s market share in the APU, CPU, and GPU markets this company could be fucked in 5+ years or so. Trade at your own caution - but I\u2019m BUYING.",

        "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/lSqyKg4\n\nEnded up hitting it big with a couple of well-placed trades this month. Started the month with $25k after being down $12k on some really stupid decisions/tp hands. I kept reloading like $1000 a day to keep myself above the 25k threshold. Told myself to stop automatically selling at 20% loss and riding out this crazy bull market. Recovered all my losses and now I\u2019m sitting with $3k in gains. I did it all in 8 trading days buying calls. Now I\u2019m still sitting in a bunch of calls. \n\nMy current positions:\n\nAAPL 400c 1/15/2021\n\nBABA 270c 7/24\n\nDDOG 100c 7/24\n\nDIS 170c 10/16\n\nFSLY 110c 7/31\n\nGOOGL 1650c 7/17\n\nJPM 115c 9/18 \n\nMSFT 220c 7/31\n\nNFLX 600c 7/17\n\nNIO 16c 7/17\n\nNVDA 420c 7/17\n\nPYPL 200c 7/31\n\nSPOT 282.5c 7/17\n\nTSLA 2000c 7/17\n\nWMT 131c 7/17\n\nZM 280c 7/17\n\nI already transferred some gains back to my bank account.

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading JULY 8th\n \n \nJOLTs 5.4 vs. 5 Million\n \nNVAX gets $1.6B from BARDA\n \n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&amp;P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&amp;P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It\u2019s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&amp;P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP\u2019s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP\u2019s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight\u2019s video about the S&amp;P is very telling, I think, with the S&amp;P only 2% off its high, the median S&amp;P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.\n \nWe sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today\u2019s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI\n\nOur Discord Forum link is on the video description..\n\nSECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off \u201c10\u20192 of thousands of employees.\u201d  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it\u2019s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don\u2019t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We\u2019ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP\u2019s to the averages.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -.67, BGS +.70, FLO -.03, CPB -.11, CAG +.54, MDLZ -.22, KHC +.22, CALM +.03, JJSF -1.43, SAFM +.54, HRL -.14, SJM +.18, PPC -.34, KR -.03, and PBJ $31.56 +.06 (.19%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB - -1.72, ABBV +.72, REGN +14.50, ISRG -9.30, GILD -.13, MYL -.43, TEVA -.29, VRTX +8.35, BHC -.59, INCY +.86, ICPT -.74, LABU +3.36, and IBB $140.15 +.71 (.51%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.13, CGC -.40, CRON -.19, GWPH +2.93, ACB +.17, CURLF -.07, KERN -.62 and MJ $13.08 -.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -8.59, GD -3.29, TXT -1.73, NOC -7.89, BWXT -1.78, TDY \u2013 7.84, RTX -2.12 and ITA $160.32 -6.10 (3.67%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.03, JWN -.58, KSS -.72, DDS -.88, WMT +9.11 (7.66%), TGT -1.40, TJX -1.84, RL -2.49, UAA -.41, LULU -6.66, TPR -.51, CPRI -.18 and XRT $43.78 -.43 (.97%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -7.40, AMZN -44.69, AAPL +1.06, FB -.91, NFLX +.69, NVDA +3.06, TSLA +9.42, BABA -2.60, BIDU -4.54, CMG -10.92, CAT -2.03, BA -8.57, DIS -.53 and XLK $106.34 -.77 (.72%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS \u2013 7.91, JPM2.52, BAC -.63, MS -1.32, C -1.53, PNC -3.15, AIG -1.36, TRV -2.45, AXP -3.48, V -3.13, and XLF $22.93 -.48 (2.05%).\n \nOIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "I've been trading a strategy that I'd love to get feedback on. It has been very successful over the last 4 months but I'm afraid I may be missing something because it seems too easy so far which means it's very likely I'm doing something that is overly risky or misunderstood. I get that this is a great market but I'm trying to get honest feedback as to whether this is a dangerous or simplistic strategy in \"normal\" markets. What I'm doing:  \nSelling puts typically at only 1 or 2 week DTE at a delta of between 8 and 15 with an IV between 40 and 100. I only sell at a probability of profit +80% and a minimum of 20% annualized return- with the short duration it can be much higher. I also try to find good support levels to set my strike under and select stocks in a strong uptrend. My win rate has been over 95% as far as having to roll.  \nFor example today I sold a NVDA $380 put for this Friday for $1.00 at a -12 delta and a POP of 89%. So it seems like a solid likelihood I can make it three days without it dropping ITM.  \nWhat's wrong with this deep OOTM and very short DTE strategy? I understand many people go 20-45 days at a higher delta which just seems to a noob like me that it's a long time for something to go wrong but I might be thinking of that the wrong way. Experienced traders I respect seem to focus on 30-45 days DTE at a higher delta like 30- has that strategy been shown to have a higher expectancy? Is the use of such a short DTE overly risky?\n\n  \nThanks in advance for any guidance,",

Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n2. They already have the X series CPUs for those who want well binned chips / top silicon. \n3. The consumer CPU market for AMD is now showing long term potential as a profit puppy. \n\u2014\u2014\n[https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results)\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAMD has a strong potential to beat Q3 expected earnings. Why? Because their production has a solid chance of recovering by then. Why? Because they have a somewhat diversified access to memory, and the raw materials needed for production.\n\n[AMD](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/interest_coverage)\n\nAMD - has had a rough go of it, but it\u2019s starting to recover. Yes In the consumers minds, and it\u2019s starting to show in the numbers as well.\n\nDirectly from the post linked above regarding AMD earnings\n\nQ4 2019 Results\n\n\"Revenue of $2.13 billion was up 50 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue was up 18 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment partially offset by lower revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.\"\n\n^ Clearly this is the direction the company is headed in my opinion.\n\n*What are my price targets?\n\nI fully expect AMD to hit ATH of 70$ per share by Q4 or Q1 2021. Why? Because there is demand. Look at what this stock was in feb 2019 and then look at its peak before Covid. Compare that to its current price. See what I\u2019m getting at here?\n\nHas anyone seen the MU surge? Memory is in high demand. Specially flash NVME and SSDs. \n\nWhat does this mean for AMD?\nAMD is heavily dependent on companies like micron (TSMC, Samsung, etc) GDDR6, flash memory, and VRAM are all dependent on this sector.\n\nThe amount of improvement in the memory sector -is staggering. Flash Memory is finally \u201caffordable\u201d to most mid-range computing customers. At the least - far more improvement here than simply PUMPING more GHz into the same cores and SMT that INTC always does. \n\n\n-----\nTLDR: Everyone already hopped on their **** why does this matter now... so what?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. - I can\u2019t speak to how the current market trends will affect this stock in the very short term. \n\nThis is literally a power play - in my opinion - showing how they can adapt to a changing market and their literally competing with theirselves now (just like NVDA competes with itself on its own high end GPUs)",

        "selftext": "Hi Folks!\n\nLong post but bear with me. I had a Motif Investing account which I opened in 2016. For those who don't know, Motif used to offer theme based investing (for instance Cloud Computing was a theme). I had a 4-5 themes and each theme had a bunch of stocks each.\n\nFast forward to this year, Motif sent me an email that they were being sold to Folio Investing and that they have a monthly fee of 19.99 per month. I used to pay a small fee on Motif for free stock advisories in different themes and free rebalancing. They also had free individual stock trading which I used instead of Robinhood. However, I decided the 20 dollar monthly fee was too much for my \\~40k portfolio in Motif. So I called Vanguard and had them initiate a rollover. I have most of the rest of my portfolio with them and very happy so far. It went well except, Vanguard doesn't do fractional shares that Motif did. So eventually Motif had to liquidate all the fractional shares before rolling over the account complete. I didn't mind that either coz I have a good chunk of Tax loss Harvesting done in March this year when shit hit the fan. \n\nNow my question is, what do I do with the individual stocks in my Vanguard account? Here are the companies I own - \n\nABB, ABBV, ABT, ADM, AFL, ALB. ALL, AMCR, AMD, AME, AMOT, AMZN, AOS, ATVI, BABA, BEN, BILI, BRKS, CGNX, CMCSA, CVX, DEO, DIS, EA, EMR, EVRI, EXPD, FTI, GLUU, GPC, HEI, HLX, IGT, IRBT, IRM, ISRG, JNJ, LEG, LMNX, MDT, MG, MITK, MSFT, NFLX, NICE, NTES, NUE, NVDA, OMCL, ON, PBCT, PH, PPG, RXN, SCPL, SE, SGMS, SNE, SOHU, T, TER, TJX, TM, TRV, TTWO, TXT, UBER, UL, V, VNE, WB, WBA, XOM, ZNGA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother piece of information - I am sitting on a gain on the total but there are certainly losers in there. I know it is a lot of information to parse through. But is there any advice on how to consolidate this? My investing philosophy has evolved and I have most of my money in low cost index funds now and would prefer to do that for this piece of my portfolio as well. Thanks for reading!\n\nTLDR: How do I consolidate a bunch of individual stocks into index funds?",

        "selftext": "\n \n \nISM Back Over 50\n \nFEDEX Loss Sends the Stock Up\n \nPfizer in the Vaccine Race\n \n We added some CVS 7/67.50 calls on the decline with an average price of $1.16 and they finished $ .59, and the NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94 this morning.  They closed today $2.81.  We also added a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .7\n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a decent start and rallied to a high of +210 by 9:45 but didn\u2019t hold it and was back down on the day by 11:00 but wouldn\u2019t give up, and spent all day between + / - 100 until the close when it sold off in the last 15 minutes and finished -77.91 (.30%).  The DJIA was the outcast with the NASDAQ +95.86 (.95%) at another new high, S&amp;P +15.57 (.50%), the Russell -14.05 (.97%), and the DJ Transports -19.71 (.21%) even though FDX and UPS had added 120 DJT points to the average.  Market internals were even on the NYSE while the NASDAQ was actually 9:7 Down, regardless of its new high close.  The DJIA was 20:9 down and WMT unchanged with no winners or losers moving over 20 DP\u2019s. Volume on NYSE was average but on the NAZ it was about 20% higher than yesterday.  Hong Kong and Covid-19 were the big negatives today and it was the ISM gains to 52.6, well over the 50 break-point, and the excitement of the PFE vaccine news were the big positives that helps us higher.\n \n \n \n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/dr95ohxzdjo\n\nOur Discord forum link is in the video description..\n\n\nSECTORS: The transports were the sector in the spotlight with FDX earnings (a loss) sending the stock higher by $16.44, although it closed just over its low of the day with a gain of 11.7% after being up over 14% for the biggest one-day gain since coming public in 1978.  UPS also gained 2.9% and between them they added 120 point to the average but still couldn\u2019t keep the average in positive territory.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -.53, BGS -.08, FLO -.11, CPB -.32, CAG +.50, MDLZ -.05, KHC -.21, CALM -.54, JJSF -2.80, SAFM -3.21, HRL -.83, SJM -.59, PPC -.15, KR -.20, and PBJ $31.06 -.17 (.54%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB -3.44, ABBV +1.22, REGN -15.55, ISRG +5.71, GILD -.94, MYL -.23, TEVA -.82, VRTX -3.31, BHC +.13, INCY -1.32, ICPT -1.41, LABU +.59, and IBB $137.80 +1.11 (.81%).\n \nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with TLRY -.06, CGC +.25, CRON +.05, GWPH +3.53, ACB -.18, CURLF +.06, KERN -.16, and MJ $12.98 +.11 (.85%).\n\n \nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -3.92, GD -.86, TXT -.77, NOC +.70, BWXT -.18, TDY -6.76, RTX -.01, and ITA $163.19 -1.53 (.93%)\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M -.26, JWN -.29, KSS -.63, DDS -.94, WMT -.23, TGT -.93, TJX +.64, RL -1.85, UAA -.12, LULU -2.82, TPR -.33, CPRI -.37, and XRT $43.06 +.18 (.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +23.95, AMZN +122.28 (4.43%), AAPL -.69, FB +10.03, NFLX +31.96, NVDA +1.49, TSLA +58.18 (5.39%), BABA +.60, BIDU +.91, CMG +17.52, CAT +.07, BA -1.85, DIS +1.45, and XLK $104.66 +.17 (.16%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -.12, JPM -.64, BAC -.44, MS -.74, C -.70, PNC -2.38, AIG -1.55, TRV -1.65, AXP -.84, V +.50, and XLF $22.94 -.20 (.86%).\n \n \nOIL, $39.82 +.55. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied midday. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. The stocks were higher with XLE $36.93 -.92 (2.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,779.30 -20.60. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

NIO, VSLR, just to name a few. Its a frustrating time because you invest in a few things for short term, and a few things for long term. What are you looking at for some useful information? I dont mean websites telling me to invest into Amazon, Disney, Microsoft, NVDA, Apple etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits a rough feeling seeing a stock at $6 last week, and double that today. We all see it, but then realize we didn't see it in time. Thats what i've been doing and im just chasing my tail looking at it going....well NOW do I invest? I know nobody has the right answer, but companies with a strong future are good investments. COVID isnt going anywhere anytime soon, so my MGM stocks will have to sit there for now. Election coming up, microsoft releasing info in a weekish, more iphones and more online shopping (seriously who got rich off overstock's...stock). Research forever, or buy apple and disappear for 10 years? My late night rant.",

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.**\n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.\n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade. Mexico is part of a puzzle that fits in a large scope that involves other bulwark nations like Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[Bulwark Trading Nations\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[The North American Trade Block\\]([https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Mexico is a nation in crisis. The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

        "selftext": "Hello, new investor here, I just started back in February right before the hit when everything was at it's highs. I had about $3000 invested into individual stocks like TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, etc but I unfortunately had to sell most of those a few weeks ago to pay bills because I am currently furloughed and it took me 15 weeks to get unemployment from the state of Florida. I also have $1500 in a Fidelity Roth that is split between FZROX, FZILX, and FXNAX.. which is still down. I also bought into my ESPP this year with Hilton so I probably should of sold some of that instead of the other ones but I was hoping to hold it at least for the two years to get the tax break. Anyways, I finally got all the unemployment owed to me in lump sums so I'm going to be ok for awhile and would like to reinvest at least half of it. I'm not sure if I should just stick with my Roth right now until it's maxed out or if I would be better in individual stocks at the moment. The 1500 was in my 2019 Roth so I think I have to start fresh with my 2020 one now so not sure if that would still help to maybe dollar cost average FZROX down?\n\nAny advice/recommendations/suggestions will be greatly appreciated!",

        "selftext": "The current policy of QE (brrrrrrrrr) according to most economic theories would mean that inflation will eventually happen, but will likely be delayed until the economy begins to reopen and spending recovers. \n\nTo avoid crowding out non-government debt, the Fed has stepped into risky bond markets and started buying those bonds to increase liquidity, this has some effect of delaying inflation but that balance sheet will unwind slowly.\n\nAnyway, if we assume that inflation will rise at a higher level that we saw in the last few years, the real winners will be people and companies with huge amounts of debt that are able to maintain enough cash flow to pay those obligations.  Their debts will be eroded by inflation, and taking on enormous amounts of debt will likely result in windfall profits assuming what they financed with debt appreciates at the same level of inflation (think share buy backs).\n\n\"the proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds reached as high as 30% in both 2016 and 2017,\u00a0\".[1]. So, by taking out loans to buy stock, which will keep pace with inflation, the companies that have participated in this behavior will stand to make huge returns, at the expense of the debt holders (at this point the fed and anyone with a savings account). \n\nSo, what are some companies that stand to benefit from this?  Any company with a huge amount of debt, little cash on hand, a large number of repurchased shares, and a strong enough business model to not default on debt. \n\nThese are the stocks I think would fall into that category.  It's important to note that companies like MSFT and APPL sitting on mountains of cash may be forced into share buybacks to avoid inflation, thus further driving up their stock prices as well.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS)\nCharter Communications (CHTR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nComcast Corp. (CMCSA)\n\nOracle Corp. (ORCL)\n\nIBM Corp. (IBM)\n\nFord Motor Co. (F)\n\nI'd be interested what your thoughts are? \n\nTldr; inflation goes up. Companies with debt that don't default will be rewarded. Companies that might default probably bailed out and rewarded also. Companies with lots of cash will have their value eroded.

        "selftext": "Hi all. Fairly new to options here. I\u2019m considering starting a wheel using one of the three stocks in the title. A few thoughts and questions I\u2019d love to get feedback on:\n\nWFC: I think WFC is really undervalued and would not mind at all owning the shares. One downside here is that I work in financial services (insurance) so I\u2019m already disproportionately exposed to the industry (employment, company stock, etc.) There\u2019s some uncertainty with the earnings release upcoming, especially since they\u2019ll be announcing just how much they\u2019ll be cutting their dividend. Is it stupid to write a put that expires after the earnings announcement?\n\nPCG: They\u2019re fresh out of bankruptcy and in my opinion have a lot of upside but very little downside. The stock price is very low, just under $10, which I know makes it a bit risky from traditional rules of thumb. However, I think they\u2019ve done a ton to mitigate downside risk with the restructure.\n\nORCL: Love the company. It\u2019s been trading sideways for a while now, and I think it\u2019s likely it will continue to do so. Higher cost than the other two stocks, so technically more risk for selling the OTM put... but not too concerned about that.\n\nQuestions:\nShould any of these be outright avoided for a reason I haven\u2019t considered?\n\nWhat\u2019s the appropriate strike for the initial short put? I was thinking something with delta in the 20ish% range. Is that about right?\n\nWhat expiry is best for the initial short put? I was thinking something like 1-3 weeks out.\n\nNote: I\u2019m only thinking of doing one contract to start. Just trying to get my feet wet / study the strategy. 100x any of these shares is a very small fraction of my portfolio, so while obviously not the goal, I could afford to lose it all. Not looking to \u201chit it big\u201d or get rich on options... just trying to learn for fun.\n\nThanks for any and all advice!",

        "selftext": "The current policy of QE (brrrrrrrrr) according to most economic theories would mean that inflation will eventually happen, but will likely be delayed until the economy begins to reopen and spending recovers. \n\nTo avoid crowding out non-government debt, the Fed has stepped into risky bond markets and started buying those bonds to increase liquidity, this has some effect of delaying inflation but that balance sheet will unwind slowly.\n\nAnyway, if we assume that inflation will rise at a higher level that we saw in the last few years, the real winners will be people and companies with huge amounts of debt that are able to maintain enough cash flow to pay those obligations.  Their debts will be eroded by inflation, and taking on enormous amounts of debt will likely result in windfall profits assuming what they financed with debt appreciates at the same level of inflation (think share buy backs).\n\n\"the proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds reached as high as 30% in both 2016 and 2017,\u00a0\".[1]. So, by taking out loans to buy stock, which will keep pace with inflation, the companies that have participated in this behavior will stand to make huge returns, at the expense of the debt holders (at this point the fed and anyone with a savings account). \n\nSo, what are some companies that stand to benefit from this?  Any company with a huge amount of debt, little cash on hand, a large number of repurchased shares, and a strong enough business model to not default on debt. \n\nThese are the stocks I think would fall into that category.  It's important to note that companies like MSFT and APPL sitting on mountains of cash may be forced into share buybacks to avoid inflation, thus further driving up their stock prices as well.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS)\nCharter Communications (CHTR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nComcast Corp. (CMCSA)\n\nOracle Corp. (ORCL)\n\nIBM Corp. (IBM)\n\nFord Motor Co. (F)\n\nI'd be interested what your thoughts are? \n\nTldr; inflation goes up. Companies with debt that don't default will be rewarded. Companies that might default probably bailed out and rewarded also. Companies with lots of cash will have their value eroded. Calls. \n\n\n1- https://hbr.org/2020/01/why-stock-buybacks-are-dangerous-for-the-economy",
