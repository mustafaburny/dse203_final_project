Ok, that's almost entirely noncontroversial.\n\n&gt;* Most engineers will never interact directly with cloud vendors, but through services on top of those.\n\n&gt;* The database market (OLAP, OLTP, you name it) will be dominated by vendors running on top of cloud vendors, where the underlying layer is completely abstract.\n \n&gt;* We will have some amazing new runtimes, finally figuring out the developer experience problems that are currently holding serverless solutions back.\n\n&gt;* We will see a lot of partnerships between startups and cloud vendors, where a cloud vendor may concede an area and try to be a preferred partner with a startup instead.\n \n&gt;* Kubernetes will be some weird thing people loved for five years, just like Hadoop was 2009-2013, but the world will move on.\n\n&gt;* Resource utilization in the cloud will be much better, and engineers will spend an order of magnitude less time thinking about resource allocation and provisioning.\n\n&gt;* IBM has finally given up on \u201chybrid multi-cloud\u201d.\n \n&gt;* YAML will be something old jaded developers bring up after a few drinks. You know it's time to wrap up at the party at that point.\n\nWhat do you think are the companies that show great potential to be a top could service provide in the next 5-10 years?",
