        "selftext": "This makes zero sense to me. I was expecting red but a 20% dump is insane given its $70 ATH. The confusion is that for the past several days/weeks people have been warning about this date for a long time. So effectively it should have been priced in with all the weak hands leaving, and for at least the option IV should have increased yet it wasnt, and now puts more than doubled. Also at times when the market is overly sure of event X going in Y direction, the absolute opposite happens. Its pretty fucking wild that we pretty much all called it. Usually that never happens. Anyone who bought puts was granted the easiest play ever. \n\nYou can claim its the PIPE dumping but I dont think the Saudis are stupid enough to dump all their shares in pre-market. There are no short shares available. It seems like retail is all selling NOW despite being warned extensively.",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed for 4 months BUT \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[COIN Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x6qvq5tiuvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eec4721d35b1315ec0be5e51129e93926fc00f)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not currently in a position but considering loading the $300 calls exp dec 21",

        "selftext": " Dear \\*\\*\\*\\*,\n\nIn response to new Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules related to pattern day trading, we are updating our policy (which will go into effect on or about September 14, 2021). Because your account was noted for pattern day trading in the past year, we wanted to make sure you're aware of the change and how it could impact your account.\n\n**Understanding the new policy.** In line with the new FINRA rules, our new policy allows for only one flag removal within the life of an account. This means that if your account is flagged again in the future, the flag cannot be removed. Previously, our policy allowed the flag to be removed from an account up to three times within a rolling year before the account was flagged permanently.\n\n**What if your account is flagged?** If your account is flagged for pattern day trading, you'll have to maintain a minimum equity balance of $25,000 at the start of each trading day to continue day trading. If you place a day trade in a flagged account with a balance under $25,000 in equity, you'll be restricted to closing transactions until you bring your equity above $25,000.\n\nTo learn more about the pattern day trading rule and how to avoid breaking it, please view our [FAQ](https://www.tdameritrade.com/why-td-ameritrade/contact-us/top-faqs.html) or [*The Ticker Tape*](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/avoid-violating-pattern-day-trader-rule-18005).\n\n**Questions?

I'm purely messing around now in an effort to learn, and despite thinking I wrapped my head around, looking at my portfolio holdings the next day has me more confused. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSituation and recap of what I've done below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- purchased 100 shares of company X, yesterday in Margin Practice account.\n\n\\- Selected  Sell to Open 1 Contract on those 100 shares, which in my understanding means I opened a covered call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Premium added up to $498 and indicates it was filled under my activity section. To my understanding this means someone purchased the covered call (or the system simulated someone purchasing it because it's a practice account).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at My Portfolio holdings the next day, I am more confused.\n\n\\- The stock moved past the strike price today (briefly), yet it looks like I still have the 100 shares under the account, meaning the option was not sold or exercised by the buyer, is this correct?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Yet under Portfolio Holdings it says the contract quantity is (-1) and Book cost says (-$498.80). Wouldn't it have been a positive $498 because I received a premium for the sale of the covered call? Also why is it telling me I have an unrealized loss of (-$221.20) when I am the one who sold the covered call?  Finally, the last price of this current contract appears to have gone-up from $4.988 to $7.20 yet the covered call I have seems to have unrealized losses. Is this because of the time decay on the contract?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny clarification you guys can provide, would be greatly appreciated. Also I know I'm not yet ready to trade real money, so I don't need the lecture. This is me attempting to learn, and make mistakes, and be comfortable with the process of selling options. I thought I had some of it down, but I'm clearly not there yet.",

Can we make a few bucks sure, do they really care, no,  what they really want to make sure of, is that we do not disrupt the money printing machine scheme, sadly on the backs of unsuspecting victims,  that like before,  and now again,  will ultimately carry the bag. Let's make sure to stand the line and hold these bad actors accountable. \n\nKeep digging,  keep studying,  keep turning those shiny smooth \ud83e\udde0 surfaces into wrinkles that look like g m e chart. Keep sniffing green crayons",

I started following the guy who recommended them on [twitter](https://twitter.com/CorneliaLake), and he has been pointing out some very interesting facts.\n\nLots of insider buying, both of stock and warrants. My understanding is that warrants aren't executable until $18 (stock is around 13-14 right now), which leaves a lot of room for growth until warrants expire. I can't remember the last time I saw upper management using their own money to purchase shares instead of trying to get them awarded. If that's not a bull indicator, what is?\n\nTheir business model looks very interesting, but I'm concerned about how healthcare laws will affect them. Management looks capable from the earnings call transcripts I've read. Wondering if anyone else is in this stock, and if you have any concerns. It's a relatively small position for me. I'm in about 600 shares.",

        "selftext": " \n\n22nd\u00a0Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops\n\nMassive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants.\u00a0**Now hops also?**\u00a0I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nInitiating coverage on\u00a0**22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),**\u00a0a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.\n\nCurrent price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)\n\nOn August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.\n\nWhen I look at\u00a0[the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st\u00a0the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today\u2019s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are\u00a0**approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.\n\nI often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company\u2019s success. Insider ownership isn\u2019t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares.\u00a0**Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company\u2019s shares.**\u00a0Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company\u2019s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it\u2019s infancy. XXII doesn\u2019t chase small markets.\n\nIn a\u00a0[letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html)\u00a0published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said \u201cI am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise \u2013 the global\u00a0**specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.\u201d\n\n95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.\n\nXXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.\n\nXXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.\n\n7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00\n\n**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA\u2019s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company\u2019s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN\u00ae King and VLN\u00ae Menthol King, including the headline claim of \u201c95% less nicotine.\u201d VLN\u00ae tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.\n\n**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century\u2019s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).\n\nThe XXII \u201ctrifecta\u201d of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an\u00a0**estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each\u00a0**1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.\n\nStay tuned for more coverage on 22nd\u00a0Century Group coming very soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 22nd Century Group, Inc.  \n22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA\u2019s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking.\u00a0**The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/exciting-report-in-a-hot-sector-coming-tomorrow-649728?e=[UNIQID])",

        "selftext": "ARK Investment Management is looking to debut a new ETF that will focus on transparency in companies and shun vice and sectors that run afoul of sustainable investing like fossil fuels.\n\nIn an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.\n\n\"Companies operating in the following industries, as determined by the Index provider, are excluded from the Index: (i) alcohol, (ii) banking, (iii) chemicals, (iv) confectionary, (v) fossil fuel transportation, (vi) gambling, (vii) metals, (viii) mineral, (ix) natural gas, (x) oil, and (xi) tobacco,\" ARK says in its filing.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be the second that Ark has launched this year. In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm\u2019s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it\u2019s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;P 500.",

But if you dig deeper in their financials there is nothing to stop them. And the major risk from CCP i believe will dissipate going forward. \n\nThe whole crackdown on Chinese tech started with Jack Ma when he talked publicly and in front of Chinese high officials , how Chinese financial system is old and cant catch up with tech innovation. This was about ANT IPO. Well, imagine the best screw up and Jack Ma did that. But this can turn into an opportunity for those who didnt have positions before in Chinese stocks. \n\n2 weeks after Jack Ma \u2018s speech, crackdown started in November last year. It is my opinion that even CCP did not imagine this much sell off. Now I believe they are taking their feet from the brake , they cant let Chinese entrepreneurship lose its hope and they need large companies to rival American ones. \n\nAlso don\u2019t forget that these scrutiny is good for Chinese stocks in the long term. It makes them better organization by fixing their weaknesses. \n\n\nIf you are interested I can write a long post with all DD inside.",

        "selftext": " \n\nUpdated coverage: Did 22nd Century (XXII) Made a Good Choice Bringing the Hop Plant into Its Family of Plants to Modify\n\nWill the FDA Give Traction to Their VLN Cigarettes Soon?\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nWe are continuing coverage on 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII), a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.\n\nCurrent price $3.3/share (at 10:00 AM EDT)\n\nAfter closing at $3.57/share in the Tuesday session, XXII shares began looking for a level of support in early trading today. I believe a support level at $3.30/share will bring buyers in and we will see increasing volume and price throughout the day.\n\nRemember, tobacco is still the flagship product at XXII and generates their revenues. For the FDA, the decisions on Juul and other manufacturers could represent a milestone as it tries to execute an ambitious tobacco regulation agenda. The FDA in April said it was taking steps to ban menthol cigarettes. And it continues to work on a potential requirement that nicotine levels in cigarettes be set at minimally addictive levels, a possible game-changer that the White House would need to approve. It\u2019s possible XXII may see a mandate and approval announced together.\n\nThe hop plant market is not as highly regulated as tobacco or hemp/cannabis, providing a faster path to commercialization. If you have followed XXII you know they have been waiting a while for the FDA to approve their ability to advertise their VLN cigarettes as a safer alternative to standard tobacco. We all know that cannabis remains classified as a schedule one drug by the US government.\n\nHop and hemp/cannabis plants have many similarities. Both are part of the Cannabaceae family of alkaloid flowering plants and the active ingredients found in both plants offer potential health benefits for managing anxiety, inducing calm, addressing sleeping disorders and resolving stomach problems, among other wellness applications.\n\nThe fact that hop, and cannabis plants are similar is important because XXII has already done a lot of R&amp;D, including that done by its cannabis partner companies, that may apply to hop plants creating new proprietary plants. Let\u2019s remember that XXII has valuable plant modification IP and know-how including utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other technology they have developed in tobacco and cannabis.\n\nThe hop plant has been grown and used to make beer for centuries (possibly millennia) without modification. XXII has picked a plant to be the third leg in in its plant modification tripod that is ready to be improved and expanded.\n\noriginal report below\n\nTL,DR - 22nd\u00a0Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops\n\nMassive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants.\u00a0**Now hops also?**\u00a0I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nCoverage on\u00a0**22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),**\u00a0a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.\n\nCurrent price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)\n\nOn August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.\n\nWhen I look at\u00a0[the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st\u00a0the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today\u2019s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are\u00a0**approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.\n\nI often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company\u2019s success. Insider ownership isn\u2019t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares.\u00a0**Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company\u2019s shares.**\u00a0Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company\u2019s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it\u2019s infancy. XXII doesn\u2019t chase small markets.\n\nIn a\u00a0[letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html)\u00a0published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said \u201cI am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise \u2013 the global\u00a0**specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.\u201d\n\n95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.\n\nXXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.\n\nXXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.\n\n7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00\n\n**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA\u2019s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company\u2019s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN\u00ae King and VLN\u00ae Menthol King, including the headline claim of \u201c95% less nicotine.\u201d VLN\u00ae tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.\n\n**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century\u2019s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).\n\nThe XXII \u201ctrifecta\u201d of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an\u00a0**estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each\u00a0**1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.\n\nStay tuned for more of our coverage on 22nd\u00a0Century Group coming very soon.\n\n**Much more DD coming including FDA and mandated lower nicotine by the Biden administration**\n\nAbout 22nd Century Group, Inc.22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA\u2019s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking.\u00a0**The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/exciting-report-in-a-hot-sector-coming-tomorrow-649728?e=[UNIQID])",

Since it's a social media company, the more marketing the better it is for the company and us. Think snowball effect. If this pops up on short squeeze lists everywhere and in the news, Vocal will gain new users to it's social media platform.  Their biggest spend is marketing and this would give them free marketing.\n\n**I'm in some shares as I'm buying at the price insiders are buying.** Worst case I just wait a bit, maybe take a small loss.

        "selftext": "Interesting company -- they retrofit other commercial vehicles, mostly Ford E/F series, with EV powertrains and sell them on.  It's kind of like a tuning shop for commercial transportation operators.  I like the idea and it has some immediate customers BUT IMO it'll likely just get bought out by Ford at some point if it generates enough revenue for them to care about.  \n\n\nNow for the short interest bit recently.  I was reading about something like a 15-20% short interest.  Ok interesting, let's take a look who owns what.  According to the info I find, 49% is owned by insiders who very well may be locked up for some time.  I then looked at open market insider transactions -- NONE!\n\nSo someone here that is way smarter than me tell me this.  IF insiders are locked up 49% + institutional at \\~5% (which are more LT focused) = 54%.  Would you say that this means that short interest then has to compete with the 46% of \"other interest\" to buy the shares back they short heavily?\n\nIf so, then 46% x outstanding shares (73m) = 33.5M shares and their avg daily volume 90day is 3.1M that means its \\~9-10 days worth of trading.  If short interest is say 20%, it's 20% x 73m = 14.6M.  14.6M/33.5M = 43% -- so really the short interest is WAY higher assuming insiders are truly locked up and or will stand their ground.  \n\n\nWhat am I missing?  Seems like this puppy really could go to the moon if short interest increases.  A short of 46% of float would potentially really equal 100% of shares that are actually going to be in play in the market.  Where do you guys get reliable #'s on short interest?  I seem to only find it in various article so it's like at least 2nd or 3rd or 4th hand.  \n\n\nFull disclosure I opened a few small calls in the $20+ range in Sep, Oct this year and another one 2 years out.  Nothing special as I wanted to look at what I could actually buy calls for vs. the giant spreads quoted.  This my first foray into this so blast away on my thoughts.",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed 4 and a half months and counting but \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CB Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/aqjaxo37nvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478a56b2d64a8f5278121224d85d13646b93ade2)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!",

        "selftext": "Hey guys and girls, first of all I just want to say that I like when I am wiping and my finger pokes through the paper.  Now that I got that out of the way I'd like to introduce you to this cool pencil company AMC.\n\nBack in January I bought a few boxes of pencils for $2/pencil.  It was a risky move with everyone working from home and using computers, but I felt like these were cool pencils and a lot of people on the internet will berate you for saying anything negative about them.  It's basically religious dogma, but for pencils, so they have to be really good.  \n\nWell believe it or not the pencils were selling for $70 a couple of months ago.  I had used a few to dislodge Legos and other small items from my various orifices.  Hard to see it but they have a scent now.  Put them in the bottom of the box and got ready to dump my box of pencils for a nice gain.  To celebrate I told all the pencil fans I've met online about the huge haul I was about to make.  Deep down I know pencils are not worth $70, but the degenerate gambler in me saw a picture of a guy in a suit on twitter saying that pencils are guaranteed to run up again.  \n\nIf you count the stinky ones I currently have 3000 pencils.  I even started buying fractional pencils because this is clearly my only chance at success.  \n\n35\\*$70 = $2,450 per pencil\n\nWell there it is I think I'm going to retire soon.  Effective immediately I am giving up on improving myself since this is pretty much guaranteed.  I don't want to be too greedy so I'm setting my limit price at $2,400.  \n\n3000\\*$2,400 = $7,200,000\n\nAmerican Mechanicalpencil Company to the moon!",

        "selftext": " \n\n22nd\u00a0Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops\n\nMassive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants.\u00a0**Now hops also?**\u00a0I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nWe are updating coverage on\u00a0**22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),**\u00a0a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.\n\nCurrent price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)\n\nOn August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.\n\nWhen I look at\u00a0[the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st\u00a0the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today\u2019s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are\u00a0**approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.\n\nI often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company\u2019s success. Insider ownership isn\u2019t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares.\u00a0**Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company\u2019s shares.**\u00a0Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company\u2019s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it\u2019s infancy. XXII doesn\u2019t chase small markets.\n\nIn a\u00a0[letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html)\u00a0published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said \u201cI am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise \u2013 the global\u00a0**specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.\u201d\n\n95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.\n\nXXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.\n\nXXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.\n\n7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00\n\n**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA\u2019s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company\u2019s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN\u00ae King and VLN\u00ae Menthol King, including the headline claim of \u201c95% less nicotine.\u201d VLN\u00ae tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.\n\n**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century\u2019s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).\n\nThe XXII \u201ctrifecta\u201d of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an\u00a0**estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each\u00a0**1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.\n\nStay tuned for more coverage on 22nd\u00a0Century Group coming very soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 22nd Century Group, Inc.  \n22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA\u2019s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking.\u00a0**The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/exciting-report-in-a-hot-sector-coming-tomorrow-649728?e=[UNIQID])",

        "selftext": "I have been avidly learning the great minds of WallStreetBets and have gained extensive knowledge on investing, risk management, and portfolio growth. WSB has introduced me to the great world of options, and it has completely changed my life. \n\n**Pre-WSB**\nI am ashamed to admit\u2026 but I used to be a\u2026 *Boglehead*. In my early investing days (~5 months ago) the dinosaur Vanguard lentil eaters told me it is *impossible* to beat the market. They all accepted an early defeat that they\u2019ll never be rich, so they default to 6% yearly returns and averaging into the occasional 40% crash. Rather than risking my money on something *totally risky* like Apple (which holds $300B+ in cash and literally only goes up), I should own Apple and 5000 other companies that nobody knows or cares about.\n\nUnfortunately, these boomers convinced me and I threw my entire portfolio into VT and BND. \u201cOwn the market and you will get rich\u2026. when you\u2019re 500 years old\u201d. After holding for 2 weeks and losing 1.3%, I sold all my shares and started a new adventure. \n\n\n**Learning from WSB**\nAs I came to WSB, I saw a skilled trader lose $100k in seconds. His life: destroyed. In the next post, I saw another investor make $100k in seconds. His life: changed! I was in awe. The Bogleheads made me lose 1.2% of my account and told me to \u201chold for the next 60 years\u201d. Meanwhile I saw someone make 10,000% in a few minutes on some SPY calls. So I did what any logical person would do and opened a Robinhood account. I promptly applied for options, and Vlad personally gave me approval. He told me that life in Bulgaria was very difficult, but through options he was able to get out of the poor eurozone and into the United States. \n\nMy first trade was a massive success. I made 20% on an SPY call. I made 3 years worth of the Bogleheads dream in minutes. These losers can\u2019t compete. In the subsequent few months, I have 100x my account. Through a series of 0-1 DTE SPY calls, I have found great success trading complex financial derivatives that I do not understand. It\u2019s amazing. My life has been changed and I cannot thank WSB enough. \n\n\n**THANK YOU**\nI would like to thank WSB for fundamentally changing my life. Not only have you made me 100x richer, but you have taught me the importance of risk taking. I would still be a Vanguard boglehead loser if I didn\u2019t discover the power of 0-1DTE SPY calls (I do not buy puts since they\u2019re anti-American \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaa). If WSB was not filled with such intellectuals, I would have not trusted the numerous great DDs.\n\nThis leads me to my question:\n**Why doesn\u2019t everyone trade options?**\nI don\u2019t think it makes sense to buy and hold something for DECADES and hope for a 100% return after 20 years. I have made 100x in 3 months and could not imagine how pathetic I would look still holding VT and BND. I have leveraged all my accounts through a series of all in trades. I now have a Tesla arriving soon all thanks to the YOLO and WSB. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t everyone do this?! It seems like free money.",

        "selftext": "Uranium.\n\nSure, there are no flashing LEDs like CRSR adds to all of their products, but that\u2019s because we don\u2019t need it. Uranium already glows in the dark! (No, radioactive things don\u2019t really glow in the dark. You have to mix trace radioactive material with a fluor to do that.)\n\nMaybe Uranium isn't as sexy as some over-hyped under-developed threadmill with an iPad glued to it that kills babies, and it is lacking in buzzwords like \"cloud data analytics,\" but uranium is energy. And everything we do takes energy, and this is the cleanest, densest, most likely candidate for the immediate future. There are already big incumbents in energy that need to get shouldered aside, so this will be a slower play than the up 50% in a week flavors of the month (which then fall 90%), but this is the real deal. With calls you can still get that 50%, or 500%, but shares will take some time. That said, many of these names are up 15% in a week, just barely OTM calls up 500%. That's not exactly [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\nUranium has a serious bull case of ahead of it. A new fund is in town (Sprott) who is buying up all the physical uranium. Get ready to gap up. Yes you have heard some of this before, and I peddled Uranium a full on year ago, but this fund is a market mover and it changes everything.\n\nSorry if you saw this quickly deleted multiple times. F'ing automod.\n\nTLDR, 1) since 2019 supply has been below demand for uranium as the market continues to deal with a supply overhang and over-investment by miners from the previous market cycle. COVID then reduced supply by a further 30% through mine closures that have continued for 2021 and the supply overhang is finally gone. 2) More nuclear reactors are being built worldwide than decommissioned, developing nations have hopped on board the nuclear train, and 3) if any country is serious about getting to carbon neutral then the only realistic avenue is via massive expansion of the nuclear fleet. Lastly, 4) there is a new physical trust (Sprott) busy buying up all of the uranium and driving up the spot price. It\u2019s working.\n\nUranium spot is $34.60 right now, 2007 was $137. That\u2019s a lot of upside baby. Oh, and did I mention that the Uranium market is small? Tiny. Super tiny. WSB could blow this thing up. There isn\u2019t an entire industry of traders, hedgers, and dilatants (that\u2019s a nice way of saying degenerates) trading U like there are for oil or other commodities.\n\n**1. The Setup**: Uranium is already on a 5 year trend line of tendies\n\nUranium has been in a bear market since 2007. It started to finally sell through the over supply and over investment of the last market cycle and has been climbing from its low of $18.50 in 2016. This was already a 4 year trend line, and then COVID came along.\n\nCOVID changed the uranium market in two main ways. First, it dramatically reduced global supply by about 30% in 2020 and 2021 due to mine closures by many of the majors and juniors. These closures have allowed the sticky overhang from the last decade to finally get put on the spot market. Second, there appears to be an OPEC+ of uranium forming. Miners, no doubt still traumatized from last time they aggressively expanded productions, are not opening new minds even as spot prices surge. Instead, they continue to provide quarterly guidance that they are operating below capacity for the rest of the year, and are selling old supply instead of starting new mines. They aren\u2019t formally a cartel like OPEC is, but there seems to be some game theory going on here. It is miner\u2019s best interest to try to exactly match the demand of U on a global scale and then be able to dictate the price. Since fuel costs are just 2% of the operating costs of a nuclear reactor, utilities can also stomach significant increases in spot prices without effecting their generation rates of \\~ $.02/KwH.\n\nU is $34.60 right now which is 75.24% below its peak in 2007. In a market with all-time highs all over the place, U has a long way to run. What will miner prices be if U hits $100+ again? Massive.\n\n**2. New Demand**: Global demand has outpaced supply\n\nPlanned Reactor Starts in Gross MWe of new capacity (from world-nuclear.org)\n\n* 2021: 5,711\n* 2022: 13,559\n* 2023: 13,276\n* 2024: 7,569\n* 2025: 5,112\n* 2026: 6,997\n* 2027: 4,100\n\nCredit Suisse offers their own global view of supply &amp; demand here. Get your sunglasses on as this assumes the US fleet is shrinking into 2030. That likely won\u2019t be the case. See comments #1, automod doesn't like my links.\n\nFirst, if you are from the US then you are likely biased against nuclear. Get over it. The US has a very old fleet and has been periodically retiring plants rather than performing maintenance. I\u2019ll get back to the US later, but the global view is very, very positive. Globally, many developing nations are starting to add, or start, a nuclear fleet. It\u2019s cheap and it doesn\u2019t pollute. India, Slovakia, Belarus, and Pakistan all have new plants started or starting in the next year. France continues to expand and sell energy, while China seems serious about cutting CO2 emissions and is massively expanding their existing fleet, as well as breaking ground on the world\u2019s first SMR earlier this year.\n\nSo back to the USA\u2014the US mostly acts as a drag. A reactor in New York just closed, and others throughout the country are always wavering on edge of retirement. This is set to change, but it depends upon politics, so we\u2019ll see (and the right likes nuclear too, it\u2019s not just about CO2). The Secretary of Energy is committed to keeping every single US plant operating as it prepares to transition to a fleet of fast breeding, small modular reactors (SMR\u2019s) in the \u201clate 2020s, early 2030s.\u201d (this just means highly fuel efficient with far, far less waste, and reactors the size of a 3-4 story apartment building instead of a city block. Each will power 500,000+ homes, so they can be \u201cclose\u201d to cities they power and also reduce infrastructure costs.) She is working with legislatures to allow all currently operating plants to essentially receive carbon credits as an incentive for utilities to keep the plants running and well maintained until the SMR roll-out.\n\nYes, this is a long horizon for the US, but the US is only one part of the uranium market and a very minor part of this bull case. Globally, supply/demand are already tight, and the world fleet is slated to expand. Utilities can see the writing on the wall and will want to start placing orders now for future delivery (spot market for Uranium is quite different from other commodities\u2014purchasing, delivery, enrichment, and feeding take years. You can bet these utilities are looking at supply/demand graphs and already panicking. Spot is going to start gapping up instead of ticking.\n\n**3. Green Energy**: The Elephant in the Room\n\nNuclear power is the greenest mass-scalable energy on the planet. Hydro destroys entire riparian ecosystems, wind and solar are both CO2 heavy in terms of manufacturing and are slow ROI on the carbon expenditure as well as having short functional commercial lifespans, while geothermal is quite literally tied to very specific locations (OK, I don\u2019t know anything about tidal, but other than reading about some plans being nixed by NIBY Boomers I\u2019m not seeing it either).\n\nThese renewable forms of power generation have another cost: land. Aside from geothermal, these are not power dense generators. Here is an article working through the cost in land to electrify just British Colombia\u2019s transport grid. The takeaway is that nuclear wins by a landslide: 2.4 m2/kWh versus solar\u2019s 36.9m2, hydro\u2019s 54 m2, and wind\u2019s 72.1 m2. If you want to electrify the US transport grid then you can either build some nuclear plants, or convert all of Nevada to a giant solar farm. I mean, what is Nevada good for anyway?\n\nNumbers on energy density coming from here: damn you automods, see comments for links.\n\nThe latest generation of nuclear plants, SMRs, are small and safe. They can be built alongside cities to save CO2 and money that would otherwise go into infrastructure. How many more fires are we going to see every fire season as PG&amp;E and other utilities run millions of miles of hot lines all over the country? This too is a cost of the current way to locating and distributing energy. This all changes with SMRs, and all for the better.\n\nBiden has made some surprisingly strong claims about aiming the US at net zero, and we\u2019re hardly a climate activist country. If this happens in other countries, and perhaps the US, then it means we are looking at hundreds upon hundreds of new nuclear power plants in the next two decades, not just the few dozen currently in the planning stages over the coming 2020s. This will be the renaissance of nuclear, and it is coming.\n\nThink about it. If there is any chance in hell of reducing carbon emissions, then nuclear is the path forward. Everything else is a half measure.\n\n**4. The Dinosaur in the Room**: Sprott Physical Uranium Trust\n\nThis is a new fund from an old hand in physical trusts. Sprott\u2019s Physical Uranium Trust (U.U \u2013 Canadian listed, NYSE coming in \\~4m) purchases uranium on the spot market and then warehouses it. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole plan. This is gigantic.\n\nAs shares of U.U are issued Sprott takes that money and buys uranium, which increases their NAV. So long as they have a premium to NAV they keep buying. They\u2019ve only been buying physical uranium for two weeks now, but **they\u2019ve already purchased 13.3% of the estimated global uranium production for all of 2021**. Read that sentence again. 20.59m lbs of the projected world supply of 154m lbs. Jesus Christ are these guys a market force to be reckoned with. How is this not illegal?\n\nLook at spot price versus their holdings. They march up and up in tandem. Spot has gone up 7.1% in the last month, with all of those gains coming within days of when Sprott started buying.\n\nSee comment link for google spreadsheet of Sprott and spot rate.\n\n**5. There are short sellers here**\n\nSome entities sell naked uranium deliveries. In a market as slow moving and opaque as uranium is this probably seemed like a good idea at the time. How much of a factor would this be? I don't honestly know. Uranium is not like other commodities with all their nifty reporting and data. We'll find out?\n\n**Positions or Ban:** OK, we know you all just skipped to the end anyway\n\nGo long anything uranium.\n\nMiners/Exploration:\n\n* CCJ\n* NXE\n* Google as many are too small by marketcap for me to list here, but they are mostly small for a reason\n* U.U (This is Sprott. Buy this, but only if Canadian. Imagine what will happen when this gets NYSE listed in 2022!)\n\nURA: ETF of major and minor miners, equipment production, all things uranium\n\n*Options*:\n\nAs we all know, there are only a few times when dealers work with your play instead of hedging against it, and one of those is when you buy far OTM calls. When you buy a far OTM call the dealer will also purchase or adjust their position matching your direction.\n\nSo, if you are buying calls (I would recommend calls *and* shares) then far OTM calls skew delta in our favor.\n\nThat out of the way, the Uranium market is slow, but Sprotts has started to speed things up.\n\nURA 10/22 $25c is about as high as I would go without going longer dated.\n\nAfter that, June 2022 $30+ is cheapish. No doubt you will all ignore this and buy something idiotic like front month $30. Really, don\u2019t do that.\n\nNXE 2/22 or 12/22 $5 or $7. I did a few call debit spreads of buying 12/22 $5, selling $7. Probably should be greedier, but it seems so safe. What could go wrong?\n\n*Shares*:\n\nI like NXE from the miners/explorers the most, but CCJ is also a very solid miner. Google smaller marketcap ones on your own.\n\nMy positions:\n\n* URA &amp; NXE shares (some other too small of marketcap to list)\n* URA 10/22 $25c\n* URA 6/22 $28c &amp; 30c\n* NXE 9/17 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $7c",

        "selftext": "Ever since GMREEEE this sub has been filled with people from r/all calling for the end of payment for order flow for a variety of reasons.  Now the front page has a news article talking about how the SEC chair is thinking about ending payment for order flow.  I just wanted to say that if you're against payment for order flow there's probably a 95 percent chance that you don't know what a call condor spread is.  PFOF gives you no or reduced commissions and also makes the options market more liquid.  Here are some arguments against PFOF that I've seen on this sub:\n\n1. HedGe FuNd GiVe BAd FiL.\n\n       In reality you can set the price for what you want your options to be filled at.  This can be done by making a FUCKING LIMIT ORDER.  There is probably not a single professional option trader that buys or sells options with a market order.  Options are, by their nature, illiquid on a majority of underlyings given that you have thousands of combinations of strikes and dates to choose from.  Again, especially if you trade spreads, you should be placing limit orders for your positions.  Also, if you remove PFOF this liquidity issue will only get worse.  This is just the reality of gutting several billion dollar firms that write and buy options.  Less money in the options market means less liquidity.\n\n2. HooDgE FunD ManiPuLaeT MarkET wItH my OrDeR InForMatIoN\n\n       I can right now go on my think or swim platform and scan for options orders under 10k (or however large you want) and look at the bid/ask spread to tell if this trader bought or sold these options.  If I really wanted to I could go into the API and make a robot that does this for me and organizes all this information into some sort of bullshit spreadsheet.  Small orders like these (the kind retail makes) provide a reasonable guess as to where retail is positioned.  I'm just some jack off wsb troll with a think or swim account and I have already laid how how to detect retail positions.  If I can do it then the big dogs certainly can do the same even without payment for order flow.  \n\n   One more thing: If you lose money on your 10 delta put it's because it was a bad trade, not because some Algo picked out your 5 lot position and spent millions of dollars manipulating the market to shake you out of your 200 dollar position.",

So even all that Earnings growth wasn't able to absorb the P/E ballooning. That includes MSFT trading at 38.09 P/E right now.\n\nThe US CAPE ratio is actually in pretty disastrous territory:\n\n[https://siblisresearch.com/data/cape-ratios-by-country/](https://siblisresearch.com/data/cape-ratios-by-country/)\n\nAnd to any Bull-siders....of course no one can really \"time\" when a bubble will pop.\n\nAlso no one can really say that inflation or continued Earnings growth won't deflate the bubble gently.\n\nBut you have to start asking yourself how will the P/E come down from these highs, because there are only three options:\n\n* Earnings Growth near term (2 to 3 years).\n* Inflation (5 year terms)\n* Market Correction\n\nDo you really think Earnings will double in the next 2 or 3 years across the board? That's your bet to take.",

        "selftext": "**What's UWMC (United Wholesale Mortgage Company):**\n\n* UWMC was a former private company brought public through a SPAC under GHIV\n* UWMC is the second largest mortgage company in the US (#1 is RKT) and the largest mortgage wholesaler in the US\n* Went public in order to generate more capital and aggressively expand and develop their business to takeover the #1 spot    \n\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n*Processing img 144nmouy6yk71...*\n\n  \nRSI is normal   \nMACD shows a weak buy signal   \nStochastics shows a neutral signal   \nstock price is in the lower range of the Keltner Channel   \ndeath cross (50MA under 200MA) is present (bearish indicator)    \n\n\nResistance at $7.46, $7.60, $8.25, $8.89 and $10   \nSupport at $7.31    \n\n\nNot gonna lie, the technicals aren't looking very good for this company.  So why am I mentioning this company?  Because there's good reason to believe that a short/gamma squeeze is possible with the current setup based on the call share structure, option chains, and upcoming catalysts.    \n\n\n**Short Squeeze Setup**  \nThere's currently 88 million shares available as the public float with short interest at 10 million shares. Institutions hold about 28million shares.  Meaning the public float is only about 60 million shares, making it a low float and easier to move up the stock price.    \n\n\n*Processing img 3jhy0rl07yk71...*\n\nTake a good look at the open interests in the number $8 call options.  Add up the call options $9 calls on top, and you have over 50k in open interests for September 17th call options. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img sbnj4fu17yk71...*\n\nNow take a look at the average trade volume (approximately 4 million).  It's not hard to figure out MMs and Institutions are shorting the stock and are manipulating the stock price to keep it below $8 to have all those call options expire worthless.    \n\n\n**Upcoming catalysts:**   \n\\- Ex-dividend date is September 9th for their $0.40/annual dividend ($0.10 for this quarter).   \n\\- Dividend Payout is October 6th.  \n\\- UWMC accepting cryptocurrency by the end of September    \n\\- $300 Million in share buybacks   \n\n\nNow if you add in the number of shares being shorted (approximately 10 million shares) with them having to return those shares by the ex-dividend date (September 9th), along with the open interests in both the $8 and $9 calls (50k x 100 = 5 million shares).   That's 15 million shares, or one quarter of the public float.  If trade volume ever exceeded 10 million, than we would have enough momentum to generate a short/gamma squeeze on this stock.",

        "selftext": "Hi ladies and gents.  I have returned from a little time-out from WSB for being a bad boy to bring you an insight deep into why TTCF is going to be successful.  \n\nOthers have already covered all the technical details, kudos to them [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/peofan/ttcf\\_the\\_clock\\_wont\\_stop/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/peofan/ttcf_the_clock_wont_stop/)\n\nand\n\n[https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pea3en/tattoo\\_chef\\_complete\\_dd\\_ttcf/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pea3en/tattoo_chef_complete_dd_ttcf/)\n\nI'm here to dive into the murky art of \"market research.\"  Uncovering value by figuring out, do people actually like this shit and will it continue to grow?  Who are vegans?  Why is anyone buying this?\n\n1. Anecdotal research: I asked my Vegan girlfriend to buy some and try it.  We live in the Vegan capital of the world, her facebook group has 9,000 vegans in it.  When we asked what people thought about the food, people said: it tastes really good (approx. 20 responses, all enthusiastic) and 1 response of \"it has wayy too many grams of fat.\"  The other vegans gave this person crap for being too picky.\n2. What is the thesis for plant based food in America?  According to sentient media, 3% of US population or 10M people are vegan.  But it gets even more interesting when we dive into what percent of the population is now prefering not to eat meat...that has increased by about 10%!  Combine a population of tens of millions that HAVE to eat food, with the problem of having very few options geared towards them (minus, just eat carbs and vegetables, which vegetarians and vegans HATE) you can see a market ready for monopolies.  Beyond meat is doing great.\n\nOpinion piece; Why has this occured?  I think GenZ and millenials have better access to information as they are more internet savvy and likely to seek information.  There is a ton of information now about practices in the meat industry (has anyone seen Cowspiracy on netflix?  LOL). People are shifting ideas about how they consume, and that is ok.  I keep eating meat but I aknowledge alot of science points to the sodium and fat in my red meat will kill me earlier lol.  Also animals are being killed for me to eat.  I'm ok with that too.  Ask your friends though; if they had to kill an animal to eat it, would they?  Do people even think about what they are eating when they eat meat?  \n\nSo i'm taking what I know about millenials &amp; genZ, my GF, and some other vegans/vegetarians I know to decide theres very few plant based options and Tatood Chef seems to be doing really well and gaining mind-share.  They are in major retailers and now landed a deal with Kroger.  I see a shift in the softness and open mindedness of future generations to reject meat more often, in favor of plant based offerings.\n\nBased on this intuition, I did what any rational person would do and yolo'd 1/3rd of my account into OTM options expiring in Oct. , based on other's DD and because I believe this product has a future.  Maybe others will too.  \n\nPosition: 50 x Oct15 25 call",

        "selftext": "So, Alibaba is of course the most discussed stock in the last month on this sub, I think. So I decided to discuss Tencent, instead.\n\nI think Tencent is simply incredible. Let's see why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WeChat** \n\nThey own WeChat/Weixin (Weixin is for mainland China, WeChat for everywhere else. I will call it WeChat). WeChat is.. WeChat. Mohnish pabrai calls it \"a bazooka Tencent can fire at will\". It has 1.25 billion users. What can you do on WeChat? Everything. Text, pay for stuff, play games, shop online, anything. Imagine if the following app existed:\n\n* Need something on Amazon? No problem, you can do it directly from WeChat through its mini-app.\n* Need to pay something in a shop? Use TenPay.\n* Need a ride on Uber? Use WeChat mini-app.\n* Need to order food on DoorDash? WeChat.\n\nReplace Amazon with JD, Uber with Didi, DoorDash with Meituan, and you have WeChat. \n\nWeChat is a bazooka beause, if Tencent decides to partner with someone and allows them to integrate in their ecosystem, that business will explode. It happened with Pinduoduo, which mainly works on WeChat: it grew 100% last year.\n\nSince it runs the platform, Tencent gets a commission. Also, it stores all the data that goes through these apps. In 2020, revenue from WeChat was 16.7 billion dollars, out of 74.6 billion in total. WeChat has 3.2 million mini programs on its platform, which transacted 1.6 trillion RMB (247 billion $) in 2020. To get how much this thing is growing, in 2017 it was 210 billion RMB (32b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's empire**\n\nTencent has an impressive number of businesses: they have a subscription revenue which is 62% that of Netflix; a media ads business (bigger than the Nyt), games, cloud, mobile payment services. Their business is so wide it is hard to navigate. Some examples:\n\n1. **Gaming**: Tencent has around 50% of market share in China in the mobile gaming industry. In 2020 they made 29.3 billions from games. In 2021 it is probably going to be lower. Online gaming industry in 2020 was 58b, it is expected to grow to 86b in 2027. Mobile gaming is projected to be 70% of the online gaming market in China by then.\n2. **TenPay**: There are two ways to pay for stuff in China: TenPay and AliPay. While in the West switched from cash to cards, and are still in transition, China has skipped a step and went directly to mobile payments. In 2018 already, a walloping 83% of all payments in China were made through mobile. Now it is around 90%. Cards are useless, in China: they account for less than 5% of payments. In the Western world, Google pay and Apple Pay are only now eroding the empire of Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. China, on the other hand, was to Tencent and Alibaba like a smooth field: they just took over. Apple pay now has around 500 million users world-wide. Tencent has 900 millions. From the last financial report, Tencent shows that revenue of the financial technology and corporate services business increased by 40% year-on-year to RMB 41.9 billion (6. billions). China's mobile payment market is projected to reach 88.4 Billion usd by the year 2027, trailing a CAGR of 47.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's fantastic portfolio**:\n\nBefore you do a cf analysis of Tencent, you need to know that Tencent has a portfolio that is currently valued around 250 billions usd at present. It is like a financial version of Cthulhu, with tentacles everywhere. It is quite hard to navigate/find information about it. They say they are currently invested in over 700 companies, of which only 103 are publicly traded. This guy has put up a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owpL6WmMK30X19Kw3BziAw39rGJbsfIMOOexdtvAkxU/edit) for you that tracks the most notable public ones.\n\nSome notable busineness Tencent owns (percentages might not be accurate):\n\na) Gaming:\n\n* 100% Riot Games (League of Legends)\n* 40% Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* 81.4% Supercell (Clash of Clans)\n* 10% BlueHole (PUBG)\n* 80% Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile)\n* 5% Activision Blizzard.\n* 20% Kingsoft (gaming competitor in China &amp; cloud business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Finance:\n\n* 30% Webank (biggest online bank in China)\n* 2%? Khatabook (digital payments in India)\n* 25% Gojek (same in Indonesia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Social:\n\n* 50.1% Huya (twitch-like)\n* 38% Douyu (twitch-like)\n* 12% Snapchat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) Music:\n\n* 58% Tencent music\n* 6.8% Spotify\n* 10% Universal music group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) E-commerce:\n\n* 25% Sea ltd (which also makes games, does mobile payments etc)\n* 18% JD\n* 17% Pinduodo\n* 7% Vipshop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf) Other\n\n* 20% Meituan (Doordash of China)\n* 15% Nio (ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Valuation**\n\nHow do you value Tencent? Currently, Tencent has a market cap of 619.72b, with a P/E of 24 and P/fcf (trailing 12 months) of 22 (Do not forget the investment portfolio, as well). fcf grew 29.4% a year in the last 10 years. Tencent has Microsoft-style profit margins of 35%. Revenue is growing at more than 30% a year, which is insane for a company this size. With its impressive portfolio, Tencent is poised to have a leading role in a country that is growing it GDP at 7%, that soon will catch up with the US, and where around 500 million people are projected to reach middle class in the next 10 years, something which will benefit tech companies the most. Of course, the risks are China regulations, in particular its anti-monopoly campaign; China in general: VIE structure, accounting standards etc. Here is an earnings based model, but take it with a grain of salt. \n\nDiscount rate: 14%. Based on eps without nri. 20 years.\n\n* Best scenario (20%): year 1-10: 25% growth, y 10-20: 10%. Value: 112.13\n* Normal scenario (60%): y1-10: 18%; y10-20: 10%. Value: 70.38\n* Worst scenario (20%): y1-10: 15%. y10-20: 8%. Value: 55.27\n* Fair value: 75.7\n* current price: 64.56. Undervalued by 17.25 % for a 14% return.  \n\n\nOf course it's all about assumptions. If you raise margin of safety, cut down growth estimates etc, you will get a very different number. I think I used a fairly conservative growth estimate, though. I personally think the upside for Tencent is insane., even though it is a behemoth already. It is one of my strongest buys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might consider doing a separate post about the risks of investing in Tencent: China regulations etc. For now.. thanks for reading!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider](https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) &amp; [gurufocus.com/](https://gurufocus.com/)\n\n[https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/](https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/)\n\n[https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/](https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/)\n\n[https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf](https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf)\n\n[https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html](https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html)\n\n[https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020](https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020)",

        "selftext": "Now I was considering doing a long drawn out post about how undervalued yada yada yada this ticker is but in reality it doesn't matter. The company is financially sound. All you need to know is Citadel has shorted this particular stock from 15 down to 1 and still won't cover. When you look at the stats, it states \\~20% of the float is shorted. What that doesn't account for is the nearly 60% ownership of the float by institutions. Of the free float, \\*\\*Citadel is shorting over 80% of it\\*\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iyx4vg67axk71.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f90ec7303d8189b7581c2247604a0253536713\n\nIf Citadel is sent into margin call they're going to be forced to cover their shorts everywhere.

I'm fairly certain they believe their position is safe here simply because retail doesn't give a flying fuck about the stock. Lets change that.\n\nThe stock is \\*\\*$WTRH\\*\\*. The company is trading under its annual revenue. Highway robbery. Couple that with diversifying into Weed delivery, Blockchain payments and a new deliver anything model, this stock could be valued at 15x like $DASH and be trading at nearly $20 a share. That's just fair value. With a squeeze... we could see 100. 1 to 100. I do hold a position, piddly winks compared to most folks. That being said, I'm all in and there simply isn't the retail demand to send the volume this needs to force them to cover. I'm sick of watching a company that is doing great things for the Southern community while expanding nationally be shorted to nearly nothing. I want revenge, and damn it if you get in now you can get revenge with the rest of the Waitards.\n\nIn all likelihood the bot is going to remove this post immediately. IDGAF, I want yall to know I'm balls deep in a stock that has ate my lunch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2h18fco8axk71.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b492a83423b35ac7ff294da5151bc96c4ab271\n\nWhile my Gain/Loss looks alright what it doesn't show is me chasing this stock all the way down from 5. My losses here are substantial and this is the last account I have left. Like I said, small position. But this is all I got left.\n\n7 straight months of red end now.",

Now there's a new bad boy at the market : ViacomCBS inc. ( VIAC ),** \n\nViacom itself is global media and entertainment company, it was founded only 2 years ago in late 2019, and has a number of major properties like the CBS Entertainment Group (consisting of the CBS television network, television stations, and other CBS-branded assets), and even well known us cable tv networks including MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, comedy central and showtime. \n\nThey fuckin own SpongeBob guys, this is a no brainer, Mr Krabs is the best god dam business man I've ever seen. Anyway, they've seen an explosive increase in profits with a recorded net income of just over, well just take a look for yourself :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[sweet goodness](https://preview.redd.it/hugwsjbh6zk71.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=179a24363f076872d5de3ed9214222a44f37aa08)\n\nNow a lotta the plays here are for meme stocks, which although points to increased volatility, has an incredible amount of risk, BUT Viacom is a member of the S&amp;P so even if it does somehow fuck its face on the pavement, it\u2019ll recover eventually. ( that is if you buy and don't use options )\n\nHowever I don't think it will be wiping out any time soon considering its earnings, as they are looking pretty nice. Now let's  take a look at a bit more reliable source ( it's not the pinnacle of stock advice but it's sure as shit better then whatever you were gonna pick ) Yahoo Finance which gives some tasty stats\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1by42k07zk71.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f4c44f7854dc7be0ef271874148a6c99287c4a5\n\n**This mamma jamma is set to increase 27% in just one year based on its earnings alone** and it's also stated to be undervalued by yahoo if the previous earning reports weren\u2019t enough for you. \n\nNow I can keep going about how this is both a fairly safe and lucrative investment but I bet only the big IQ boys have made it this far so I'll leave ya my \\*mentioned sources so you can do all the extra research you would like.\n\n* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC?p=VIAC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC?p=VIAC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)\n* [https://www.google.com/search?q=viac+earnings&amp;rlz=1C1CHZN\\_enUS918US918&amp;oq=viac+earnings&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.2233j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=viac+earnings&amp;rlz=1C1CHZN_enUS918US918&amp;oq=viac+earnings&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.2233j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)\n* And the website : [https://www.viacomcbs.com/](https://www.viacomcbs.com/)\n\nALSO, it has an ex dividend date of Sep 14, so if you're into that kind of stuff you best move that booty.

The confusion is that for the past several days/weeks people have been warning about this date for a long time. So effectively it should have been priced in with all the weak hands leaving, and for at least the option IV should have increased yet it wasnt, and now puts more than doubled. Also at times when the market is overly sure of event X going in Y direction, the absolute opposite happens. Its pretty fucking wild that we pretty much all called it. Usually that never happens. Anyone who bought puts was granted the easiest play ever. \n\nYou can claim its the PIPE dumping but I dont think the Saudis are stupid enough to dump all their shares in pre-market.

Rose 0.6 billion since I posted 2 days ago. Even if it was at $5 billion, this puppy is grossly undervalued\n*  They have $1.7 billion of cash on hand.

They grew\u00a0**360% YoY**, which means this company is both making more revenue and more earnings on that revenue than expected, and they\u2019re STILL at lows\n* Analyst coverage is all positive. Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating. Insiders (both the current VP and an external investment company who had a 10% stake) bought **MILLIONS** of shares in the last week. \n\nThis is an exceptional growth stock, valued at an absolutely outrageous discount. Name another company growing 360% YoY to half a BILLION dollars. We can compare it to TDOC who is growing slower, make less revenue, is valued at 8x higher in terms of market cap, have WAY worse profit margins, and don\u2019t have a feasible path to profitability soon. OSCR on the other hand has been increasing their profit margins quarter over quarter for the last 4 quarters\n\nI can see why people are skeptical of just a random stock they never heard of, but this stock seems to be sitting at completely retarded levels right now.

        "selftext": "# Corsair Gaming\n\nThe **COVID-19** has accelerated gaming activity and companies in this segment saw a dramatic **surge** in sales.\n\nI've been looking for a gaming company to invest in for a while now, and after an extensive research I realized that the best pick in this sector is **Corsair.**\n\nWith a market cap of **$2.71B**, **$1.7B** in sales (2020) and **massive revenue growth** in past 2 years, **Corsair,** is the natural selection for those who are looking to add a **gaming exposure** to their portfolio.\n\n***Company's overview :***\n\n*Th*e company designs and manufacture gaming and streaming products, **Corsair** offer their user a vast verity of products : gaming Key boards and mice, headsets, audio equipment, gaming PCs and many more.\n\n**Corsair** operates in 75 countries, and delivered 190M gaming and streaming products.\n\nThe company's CEO - Andy Paul, is actually one of Corsair\u2019s co-founders (established in 1994).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Company's Financials:***\n\n**Corsair** reported **second-quarter 2021** earnings on August 3 before the market opened, with a **24% YOY revenue growth**, all thanks to the gaming segment - **40.9% YOY revenue growth** from gamers equipment sales and **17.6% YOY revenue growth** in the gaming components.\n\n***But,*** investors must take into account that **not all roses** with **Corsair**'s financials, **Corsair's EBITA** grew only 4% YOY even though revenue grew 24% YOY.\n\nThe main reason is an increase in logistics costs, including ocean and air freight.\n\n**Company's revenue** reached in **Q2-2021** to **$472,903M** while **cost of revenue accounts for 72% from revenue,** and **net income** reached only **$27M**, which is **6%** out of the total quarterly revenue.\n\n**I**nvestors should also look at **Corsair's direct competition** financial healthiness, the $18B giant - ***Logitech ($LOGI)***,generated this Q $1.3B In sales and their **cost of revenue accounts for 55%,** which is a reasonable ratio in this segment, plus, **net income** reached to $186,641M ,which counts for 14% out of the total quarterly revenue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmall amount of cash on hand is another weak spot for **Corsair,** with only $134,572M, while ***Logitech***  has $**1.5B.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Company's*** ***Debt :***\n\n**Corsair** downsized debt and other liabilities - but not significantly - YOY change of 3.3%, to $848,718MWhile ***Logitech*** managed to do the same but in a larger scale YOY change of 19%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Major players movements:***\n\nThis quarter institutional companies open 11 new position in CRSR which definitely an indicator to follow.\n\n# Analysts\n\nwith 4 analysts its seems that at the current price, even at the low projection CRSR is nothing but a bargain.\n\n# My conclusion\n\n&gt;**Corsair** maybe don't have the best financials versus their competitors, but they defiantly have the growth, and a major fanbase, with Logitech focusing more and more on offices supplies **Corsairs** niche is much more special with plenty of room to run.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the number of users in gaming and streaming industry has surged hysterically and CRSR is the first true omnichannel presence in the space.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;CRSR has built this omnichannel through acquisitions like elgato ,which sells pro-level quality products.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I believe that with time **Corsairs** will  will be able to position themselves not only as a top brand among users, but also financially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Resources:***\n\n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/CRSR:LOGI/Corsair:Logitech/Revenue?ref=crsrvslogi)\\- compare companies\n\n[2. whaleswisdom.com](https://2.whaleswisdom.com) \\- hedge funds movements\n\ntipranks- analysts reviews",

        "selftext": "Okay you guys and gals, I'm back. Yes this has been a bloodbath. No getting around that.\n\nIn order for a squeeze to happen it requires 2 things: Public Interest &amp; Share Buying. \n\nInvestors often make the mistake of going \"well X factors and Y factors have happened so long as you've done the DD remain Bullish.\" The problem is that the general public are NOT investors and have no idea, nor are even aware of x or y factors. Those things simply have no affect on them. The general public is ONLY aware of hype. They have to see it enough, they have to hear it enough, they have to be shown proof that it's going...UP. That's right. While DD will keep investors happy to buy as the share price drops, a downward trend will scare off the general public. They only buy when things are going up. The stock has taken a beating and everyday has dripped down slowly but surely. That tells me that bulls are doing their best to hold on but even they are losing conviction by the hour. Thus the slow decline down. This stock needs a fresh new injection of public interest in order to spike up the price. Just the truth. Bulls have either spent all they can, or exited without plan to return in the near future. **The idea now is to flood YouTube Twitter Facebook etc with DD on $SPRT and well detailed explanations of WHY the si% increase is bullish- with examples and data given.** Target accounts with large followings, especially those related to energy/tech/crypto, because that's how you will reach the largest audiences possible. Tons of YouTube videos etc. That newfound sentiment has to be garnered. Write articles and publish them so people searching up the stock come across them. Things like that. Strategic planning. Just the truth. Eventually news will pick it up and wonder why so many articles have been written, why it's being discussed all over social media, etc. $GME at the beginning of the year had dedicated Bulls that ensured the public interest was extremely high. \n\nNext up is Share Buying. The concept is simple enough. Buy shares. Again Bulls are mostly spent. So this plays in tandem with the Public Interest support. Buying otm options at this point is a waste of money until this begins to trend upwards. \n\nWe have a long weekend coming up, monday is labor day. Every Friday the past month, the stock has spiked. It will happen again this Friday. Shorts generally do not like holding ver the weekend. They certainly will not want to hold over the long weekend. What am I saying? The best plan of action is to flood the internet and garner as much public interest on $SPRT by Friday. This will invoke a massive share buying process, forcing shorts to cover a higher si than before- with a lower float than before. Again the long weekend is coming up. If you read this, and are bullish, give at least one of those things a try. At the very least spread the general message as much as possible. Not just on reddit but across social media platforms. Again, the general public is the audience.",

        "selftext": "I walk into a hamburger shop called HoodBurger.\nIt\u2019s busy. A lot of people wanting hamburgers. I tell the register guy, we will call him Vlad, to take my money and that I\u2019m willing to pay 5 dollars for a hamburger. Some people will pay twenty dollars- some more for a burger! Everybody else also orders and pays Vlad. \n\nSo then Vlad takes all the cash in his hands and walks past the kitchen and in to a back storage room where all the Mayo is kept. He opens the door and a guy, we will call him Kenny- is waiting. Vlad hands Kenny the burger order sheet and all the money. Kenny says- thanks! He then hands Vlad some cash for info on everyone\u2019s order. Vlad sticks it in his pocket and profits from handing over the info. He swaggers back up front and let\u2019s everyone know they will get their burgers soon and at the best price.\n\nMeanwhile in Mayo Closet with Kenny:\nThe burger order sheet he paid Vlad for allows Kenny to look over the orders and he is able to see what everyone wants. He can see what burger is most in demand. He can see the additions like extra cheese, or no pickles, and any number of other things- but what will really help is that he also sees what everyone is willing to pay for the burgers!\n\nWith this info, Kenny is able to analyze everyone\u2019s order and ultimately decides what people will pay for their burger, thus creating a perceived overall value of the burgers. Since he has had time to analyze data, identify popular or unpopular burger trends- he can manipulate the \u201cworth\u201d of a burger how he wants- so he assigns prices accordingly. \n\nNot only this- but now Kenny can make decisions about what to stock up on based on what people want or don\u2019t want. Thus charging more or less based on burger order trends. He can charge more for cheese since everyone wants it. Hell! He can even purposely keep a low supply of cheese in HoodBurger so people that really want it- will fomo buy that cheese so hard! Imagine if Kenny ran a nationwide HoodBurger chain! With all this inside information he can shape the whole burger market and monopolize it in no time.\nThis is Payment for Order Flow.\n\nNow- let\u2019s say HoodBurger just charged people a basic burger price. And Vlad took the burger order to the kitchen- the cooks made it, and then Vlad gave the orders back when cooked. Easy peasy. This way the price of customers burgers and/or the whole burger industry isn\u2019t fucked over by manipulated \u201cburger worth.\u201d The people are getting what they pay for. No data manipulation or price fucking. It is what it is. Everyone can see the orders being made, money coming in, and burgers going out. This keeps it open and honest.\nThis would be a lit exchange. \n\n(But poor Vlad doesn\u2019t collect any side money this way)\n\nNow- back to Kenny\u2019s Mayo storage room. This is where Kenny analyzes data away from everyone\u2019s view. He\u2019s hidden in a back room absorbing order info that he then uses to make burger market decisions based on the information received. He changes prices based on order trends, maybe even sells and puts 50 burgers on loan that he can\u2019t actually provide for months. \nFuck! He may even fabricate some synthetic burger nonsense made out of felt and googley eyes and sell them as real burgers- site unseen. This is where Kenny does all his shady shit behind closed doors while directly fucking the burger market.\nThis is the dark pool.\n\n\n\nSo there you go! A little lesson in PFOF, dark pools, shady shit at HoodBurger, and evil fucking Kenny with too much fucking mayo on his goddamn khakis.\n\nCheers! ;)",

        "selftext": " \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor nor is this financial advice, make your own decisions. Data from PLTR's latest 10-K &amp; 10-Q.\n\nPosition: long shares of stock @ $24.67 and have over doubled my position since Mar-21\n\nTL;DR \u2013 still bullish on PLTR and buying shares on down days. Financials improving each quarter. Waiting for the breakout.\n\nMy analysis primarily focuses on the financials of PLTR AFTER stripping out the Stock Based Compensation (SBC). For more background on this check my last post about it, but basically, I don\u2019t believe the market should be putting so much weight on this when analyzing the financial health of the company: . Also, the fact that PLTR is allowed to present financial data in their 10-K &amp; 10-Q filings after stripping out SBC shows that this is how the company should be analyzed. See previous post for more info on that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lygxog/why\\_pltr\\_is\\_still\\_a\\_growth\\_tech\\_stock\\_you\\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lygxog/why_pltr_is_still_a_growth_tech_stock_you_still/)\n\nActuals = true GAAP results\n\nAdjusted = financials after stripping out SBC\n\nAnyways, here are the numbers and keep in mind that Q3-20 experienced abnormally high costs from when PLTR went public:\n\n[Actual amounts including SBC \\(Stock Based Compensation\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7zjpoy0l1yk71.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a474769499bbcbef7519ff0b93a55195ed07f8)\n\n[Actual QoQ change](https://preview.redd.it/luadb4om1yk71.png?width=855&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe769d88a5bc4f76a8edc2e768c7a3b03c190d9b)\n\n[Actual QoQ change](https://preview.redd.it/2uw29zwn1yk71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d766e7cc2f1cc42ddce5a7a2896fc77343171da9)\n\nRevenue, COGS, Gross profit are all improving minus Q3-20 when the company experienced a significant amount of non-recurring costs due to its IPO. Revenue growth is still strong QoQ at 10.1% and 49% since Q2-20.\n\nEBITDA is looking quite strong as this is now the 6th straight quarter of positive EBITDA. Additionally, EBITDA as a % of Revenue continues to grow which shows the company\u2019 ability to grow profitability as they scale.\n\n[Actual Quarterly EBITDA](https://preview.redd.it/r055rw7r1yk71.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2c73d447a51b4ab3fd1692cb92ad82fd6918d69)\n\n[Actual Quarterly EBITDA](https://preview.redd.it/d0r7fmgs1yk71.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d907b77027ca12dce83893bc2f4994fbc7b3c7ec)\n\nOn an adjusted basis, Revenue and Gross Profit continues to expand while SG&amp;A costs have remained constant:\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/c9m7w5wu1yk71.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e46ca342cee63b1e8e84a103fe90f4dd4aef6b7)\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/94d7uf0w1yk71.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fdf6b9d4b45538d5b67fdfb5e53a746c1deb5d9)\n\nTo expand upon the adjusted costs of the company, PLTR is proving it is on the right track toward sustained profitability as their operating costs have remained constant while simultaneously expanding revenue and gross profit. This also means that the company is continuing to prove profitability as the costs as a % of revenue are trending lower and lower each period:\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/37832yax1yk71.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=678a3b9870658a0f5633c27b6748f3a9ef542beb)\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/vptptrdy1yk71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94646245b3948903ca7bba99953d06b70b74f5f8)\n\nLastly, EPS on an adjusted basis has been positive for the past 3 quarters:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d72trk702yk71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=936fa8faa6836bc2b2905e49be9a530c943bc3d2\n\nQuick Balance Sheet Look:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vleuvfl12yk71.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f576e99464be75a98d5d30820e3dbee8ee40cc2\n\nThis was the first Quarter that PLTR has reported $0 debt and have $2.3B in cash \u2013 quite impressive for a growth stock. Additionally, their current ratio and d/e ratios show no signs of liquidity/solvency issues (as expected).\n\nIn Summary: These posts don't generally focus on the qualitatives, but I have read almost nearly only great news about this company in the past 6 months yet the stock continues to get beaten down. The stock appears to be mainly being hurt due to 1) inflation fears, 2) differing opinions on valuation, and 3) stock based compensation criticism. However, none of these factors have an impact on the CORE operations of PLTR which I believe to be are extremely strong and all trending on the correct path. If long term investors can stay strong and continue to buy into this weakness, I think they will be happy they did so in 2-5 years\u2019 time. I will be curious to see if PLTR can break out of the 27.50 resistance or if it will fail that level and retest the low 20s again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/skenvzh22yk71.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8053f895a7e8683e4e5878c2489787093c0dff58",

        "selftext": "Bare with me, a lot to uncover. \n\nI work in a drywall company and there has been constant price increases for MATERIAL over the past year starting since almost October of last year.\n\nDrywall, aluminum, lumber, insulation are all receiving price increases from the manufacturers.\n\nPart of the reason we saw material increases was so manufacturers could make up losses from COVID. Seems like they realized how much money they can make off of this and kept up the price increases, even if they broke even with the first increase. \n\nToday, we had our weekly meeting and our boss, owner of the company, was telling us that Mcstain Neighborhoods, a builder in Denver, CO has stopped their building because they weren\u2019t making any money on the last 5 houses they built. According to my boss, they had to write $20,000 checks in order to complete the house, racking up to a whopping $100,000 with just 5 houses.\n\nHere\u2019s why I wanna buy puts (not sure how far out though) \n\nBuilders are selling houses BEFORE they\u2019re built, on fixed prices. \n\nBut the house is already more expensive to build DURING production, resulting in a profit loss from the builder because they are now paying to build this house.\n\nExample:\n\n- Buyer picks a house model. Cost to build this house is $250,000\n\n- House sold at $400,000 - builder can\u2019t change price.\n\n- Constant price increases changed the build cost from $250,000 to $420,000. \n\n- Builder pays $20,000 to finish the house. \n\nHere we see one builder slow down its building because they are losing money when the house is closed. Building permits are DOWN 35% from last year. Building has been slowing down and it\u2019s only a matter of time until it comes to a halt.\n\nHow many more builders are going to follow? \n\nHow many builders right NOW are talking about slowing down building? \n\nIs this priced in?!?!??\n\nEvery month, there is a new price for our drywall, EVERY MONTH. \n\nMy prediction: Builders will come to a halt sometime in the next year, I\u2019d be surprised if it hasn\u2019t stopped by April of next year. These houses are getting too expensive to build and the builders who own all the land, are stopping production.\n\nMany things are going to happen here. \n\nMaterials for building will lose demand. Very very fast. \n\nPeople are going to temporarily lose jobs until prices come back down. \n\nProfits are gonna be off the table, who\u2019s making money if there\u2019s no work happening?!? Builders don\u2019t wanna pay that expensive Material! No material. No House. \n\nBUT, is this infrastructure bill only going to cause more inflation? Is every aspect of building going to be affected by the infrastructure bill? Only a few?\n\nPlease, be my guest and throw down some tract home builders, commercial builders, any that have a public traded stock. \n\nSo far, we work with Century Communities (CCS) , they are one of our builders with a publicly traded stock. Their price is sitting at $70.\n\nI would like to buy 6-8 month put contracts on this stock because im expecting building to slow down, and im expecting profits to fall off. \n\nBut is this already priced in? \n\nThere\u2019s money to be made during this transition of builders fighting against manufacturer pricing, but I would like some input on where you guys would put your money if building does happen to come to a halt. \n\nSide note: if you looked at my profile, you\u2019d see I\u2019ve made some dumb investments that my 19 year old self isn\u2019t too proud of. But I do eventually hope to seek a good understanding of the market and here I am witnessing the fuse getting closer to the bomb and trying to make money off of it. \n\nTLDR; Materials to build a house is getting expensive. Builders are starting to slow down their building until prices come back down. This may create a domino effect and cause many jobs to be off the grid temporarily. Puts on builder companies, material manufacturers, and all those rich corporations that build is my guess, not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "Matterport will create a digital clone of our world for the metaverse.\n\nBefore I explain how, check out my previous DD posts for some context.  \n[MTTR Bringing 3D Photogrammetry Experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/)  \n[MTTR Explosive Potential](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3469k/mttr_update_explosive_avenues_of_potential/)\n\nNow, you\u2019re probably wondering \u201cWhat is the metaverse u/cru3211?\u201d\n\nLet me tell you.\n\n# The Metaverse\n\nThe **metaverse** is a paradigm shift in the way we organize ourselves as a society. It\u2019s an evolutionary embodiment of technology &amp; the internet. It\u2019s commonly envisioned as a \u201csecond layer\u201d to our world. Sort of like\u2026 a virtual clone of it\u2026 that\u2019s digitized. See where this is going?\n\nThis is the **spatial web**. It represents an emerging three-dimensional web experience. It\u2019ll blow the old internet out of the water.\n\nresearch: metaverse, web 3.0, and spatial web for more insights.\n\nMSG me and I\u2019ll ramble more about the metaverse. For now, just understand that it\u2019s an inevitable innovation that will see widespread growth within the next decade. Matterport is likely (but not guaranteed) to be a part of this evolution.\n\n# Government Contract\n\nMatterport has entered the public sector to digitize the valuable assets of the US government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cThrough the use of Matterport\u2019s technology, federal agencies will be  \nable to *digitize and index* government facilities, infrastructure and  \nother assets such ***as airplanes, ships and submarines.\u201d***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cFor example, in the event of an emergency, digital twins of  \n**buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, water supplies or electrical grids** can be instantly viewed and analyzed by authorized users to  \nrespond more efficiently\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cAccess to 3D digital twins and the spatial data behind them can fuel  \na multitude of use cases such as **emergency response, military**  \n**training and historical preservation**.\u201d - George Hoyem at In-Q-Tel\n\nHow could you not be bullish? They\u2019re creating a private searchable 3D database. This is immensely powerful. Imagine being able to visualize the entire underground infrastructure of NYC without having to dig everything up? \n\n# Collaboration Tool\n\nYou know how on Google docs you can live collaborate with other users on a doc? I use it all the time. Matterport just added that for digital twins. That leads me to my next point.\n\n# Prediction:\n\nI\u2019ve come to believe that Google will want Matterport. I have no evidence of this, it\u2019s just a feeling. This is because the two companies align in a variety of ways. (I guess Google could just develop their own tech, but I just feel like they might take the easy route and acquire.)\n\n* Google Earth has exteriors of 3D buildings, but not interiors. Imagine how Matterport\u2019s 3D dataset could be utilized for that tool?\n* Matterport and Google are both platform companies with a focus on big data and indexing that data.\n* Google Real-estate searching was removed about a decade ago, but what if this was the catalyst for them to bring it back. I predict that Google will bring back real estate searching but integrate it with 3D interactive experiences.\n* Google\u2019s AI research could be fueled by Matterport\u2019s datasets.\n* Matterport could be integrated with Google\u2019s suite of apps.\n\n**My positions:**  \n100 shares at $14. Some calls expiring from Sept \u2013 December ranging from $17.5 - $25.",

The bot feed shows 10 out of 12 posts removed and people give up. \n\nThe owner of the auto mod script left because of the owner of this subreddit not caring. He won\u2019t add new mods. Old mods leaving. Nobody seems to care.\n\nAnother similar post was made because we see the posts being removed and most are resourceful. Thankfully the bot saves the information before its removed. At least we can see the first paragraph and headline.\n\nThis automod was managed by the mod who is gone. Who is going to moderate her now\u2026 they offered a mod spot to lunchbox but the owner isn\u2019t around.\n\nThis subreddit has literally gone from the best spac place to a questionable sub at best. Anyone thinking the moderation of posts on a community of less then 1-2k at once is needed doesn\u2019t know how Reddit works.\n\nAdd 5 active mods and they will manage the community. It would grow faster. They tried to make this community have wsb style auto mods and roles based on status..\n\nWe are here for one thing. Resources. Shared resources on spacs.\n\nPull the feed from r/spacs with mee6 and look at how many decent posts are pruned. Before you downvote this and think I don\u2019t know what I am taking about just understand I have been pulling data on this reddit for almost 2 years.\n\nManulinkitty and I had a discussion about the auto mod and while he was active he would fix posts that were filtered but he left. The owner of this reddit doesn\u2019t add new mods. \n\nSomeone needs to find a way to take over that role and get 3-5 active mods who can help moderate the community. We already have the vote feature. No other community requires a statement and disclosure on a dd post..\n\nThat was a new mod stepping in who wasn\u2019t apart of r/spacs then he just leaves.\n\nNobody seems to really consider how much resources were pulled from this subreddit before it was turned on. It was the basis of the discord server we are in. Since it was turned on we saw about a 10-20 percent post rate and used not even 10 percent of the posts we used before it was here.\n\nWe talked to the guy who made the script. We know it was because of wsb and cciv. When there was 20-50k on at once. Now its just the small lot of us left.\n\nCaring about the community should be worth discussing without downvoting and being mean. This is for the love of r/spacs\u2026",

I have two more days to go, and most Fridays stocks go into the red to burn options holders.\n\nMy gambling question is this:\n\nDo you cash out at 10% or do you 'let it ride' if you have a few days to go?

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed for 4 months BUT \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[COIN Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x6qvq5tiuvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eec4721d35b1315ec0be5e51129e93926fc00f)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not currently in a position but considering loading the $300 calls exp dec 21",

        "selftext": "Why would anybody bet everything on one and one stock only ? Have a sit, a cup of tea or whatever the heck you\u2019d like and let me show you why Aston Martin Lagonda is a 2to5 years 5xto10x in the making. \n\nThe basis of this investing thesis solely relies on two names : Lawrence Stroll and Toto Wolff. \n\nThe first one is a self made billionaire, the second one is a self made multi millionaire.\nDo they know two and a half things about how to make money ? Yes they do. And they have invested respectively $500M and $50M into a publicly traded company that we can all invest in. \nTo put it differently, If one of these two fine gentlemen had personally come to me and asked for my money for an entrepreneurial journey, I\u2019d have given it to him with a big smile on my face. And the stock market gives us the opportunity to do so. \n\nWhy is it in this case such an absolute beast of an investment ?  \n\nAston Martin is a worldwide brand that has been competing with the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini and others for the past 100 years. You know the brand, I know the brand, my grandma knew the brand (it\u2019s a shame she died recently, RIP grandma \ud83d\udc7c ) and so on and so on. This brand has been around AND mismanaged for 100 years (it went bankrupt 7 times already) but has still managed to survive over a century and 7 bankruptcies. Why is that ? Because people over several generations have loved the brand too much to let it die. \n\nLast save was lead by Stroll and its consortium back in March 2020. He also brought along Toto Wolff and his investment firm. Wolff started life with almost nothing and a single mum to support him. He is now worth $500M, he is also a 7 times F1 team principal world champion. Personally, I don\u2019t have a job. \n\nWhy is it so lit you ask ? \n\nBecause Stroll owns an F1 team. Which is a race driving team evolving in a championship (F1) often (always) considered as the pinnacle of motorsport. I know you Americans don\u2019t give a flying f**k about F1 but F1 tv rights have been bought by an American media company called Liberty Media back in 2017. What\u2019s Liberty Media goal over the next 5 years ? Make you LOVE Formula One. What is the business potential of such a journey ? Infinite. Is this good for the brands involved in the sport ? Rhetorical questions  of course  \n\nWhy is it so lit part 2 ? \n\nBecause Stroll has merged his F1 team (Racing Point at the time) and his luxury car company Aston Martin in order to promote the latter. This has created and will keep creating insane marketing potential for Aston Martin over the next five years. His goal being to crown his kid (an F1 driver for Aston) as world champion. Lawrence Stroll (again, a self made billionaire) has literally skin in the game, thus the biggest incentive to make this all work out. \n\nThanks to his network Stroll has already managed to bring Daimler (Mercedes parent company) along and take a 20% stake into the company. Why is it so important ? Because I\u2019m convinced that this deal works as an insurance : If everything goes south Daimler will buy the full company for a decent price, allowing shareholders to get back a large share (if not all) of their principale. That ticks Buffet\u2019s first and most important rule for investing : don\u2019t lose money. \n\nStroll has made the safety car an Aston Martin. Which is just absolute insanity in terms of marketing. If you don\u2019t know what it means Google safety car and see for yourself how much attention this brings to the brand. \n\nHe has hired Tobias Moers from AMG who 4x\u2019d sales in 5 years during his time as a CEO there. Moers is not only a CEO, he is also a Chief Technical Officier and that\u2019s just a big fat gold bar\n\nStroll finally has successfully launched a high profit high margin vehicle (an SUV) called the DBX. Which basically saved the brand and will in the future be THE game changer that will make the company and the stock flourish. \n\nSales have been crazy good but volumes were so low last year that I\u2019m not going to brag about it. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk good stuff, valuation. \nLamborghini is not publicly traded and has a valuation evolving around $10B. \nFerrari is publicly traded and has a valuation of $40B (not $53B like yahoo finance says). \nYou know what Aston Martin valuation is ? $3B. Lol. \n\nAston Martin will never be Ferrari because Ferrari is the pioneer and historical leader of the industry. They are the Apple/Tesla of the luxury sport car industry. Lamborghini though is a cool player with much less potential than Aston Martin. Less prestige in the name, less reach with the products. \nIf Aston Martin had been well managed they\u2019d already be number 2. They haven\u2019t. And now they are. In the best cases scenarios we could see a $15B to $25B valuation in the next 5 years. And in the worst cases scenarios a deal struck with Daimler for $3B to $7B. \n\nWe almost can not lose money and we can 10x our plata. I can\u2019t see any better investment available on the market right now. \nThere are no options available but I\u2019m betting with my (and my mother) lifetime savings so no mistakes and no fu***ng around allowed on this one. \n\nDo I know what I\u2019m doing ? No. \nLawrence and Toto know it for me and that\u2019s all I need. \n\nThank you for reading \nEat a d**k, of course.",

Because your account was noted for pattern day trading in the past year, we wanted to make sure you're aware of the change and how it could impact your account.\n\n**Understanding the new policy.** In line with the new FINRA rules, our new policy allows for only one flag removal within the life of an account. This means that if your account is flagged again in the future, the flag cannot be removed. Previously, our policy allowed the flag to be removed from an account up to three times within a rolling year before the account was flagged permanently.\n\n**What if your account is flagged?** If your account is flagged for pattern day trading, you'll have to maintain a minimum equity balance of $25,000 at the start of each trading day to continue day trading. If you place a day trade in a flagged account with a balance under $25,000 in equity, you'll be restricted to closing transactions until you bring your equity above $25,000.\n\nTo learn more about the pattern day trading rule and how to avoid breaking it, please view our [FAQ](https://www.tdameritrade.com/why-td-ameritrade/contact-us/top-faqs.html) or [*The Ticker Tape*](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/avoid-violating-pattern-day-trader-rule-18005).\n\n**Questions?

That\u2019s what we are currently valuing everything at.\n\nThe market has YET to factor in that we own 80% of Lomotive which has an independent valuation of 5 billion dollars. 80% of 5 billion is 4 billion so we can add 4 billion on top of 300 million.\n\nSo we are now at a Market Cap of 4.3 BILLION DOLLARS. So 4.3 billion divided by 104 million shares is around $38.\n\nThat\u2019s the fair share price... $38\n\nHope this helps and stop listening to people who have no clue and can\u2019t hold stocks for more than a day.\n\n20 million Warrants exercised at $9 for BBIG\n\nAsk yourself - why would an investor do that?\n\nit would\u2019ve cost a lot more to buy shares on the open market. Therefore, it is an $18 million dollar bet that the stock is going way up.\n\nShort squeeze, volume increase, upward trend and proxy news are all great. BUT an 18m investment at $9 per share is well enough conviction in itself.\n\n$BBIG - [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/543613966728036381/882807025753522216/Screen\\_Shot\\_2021-09-01\\_at\\_9.59.15\\_PM.png](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/543613966728036381/882807025753522216/Screen_Shot_2021-09-01_at_9.59.15_PM.png)\n\n[https://gyazo.com/a3626f2ee74fc227f48c379b53fdeda5](https://gyazo.com/a3626f2ee74fc227f48c379b53fdeda5)\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18891144](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18891144)",

        "selftext": "Before the recent hiccups among multiple SPACs (PSTH, ACIC, MUDS, ALTU, etc etc) I would be highly enthusiastic about the price warrants are currently trading at. before last month i never lost on a single warrant i bought under .70 cents. Now days i do believe the trust is gone and this is the reason warrants have been hitting new lows almost daily.\n\nBear case: \n\nSPACs are dead\n\nSPACs are losing the trust of the public markets\n\nlittle to no pop on warrants with undesirable targets, some even drop from very low levels .60s down to .40s \ud83d\ude2c (PAIC recently)\n\nWarrants that do pop aren't even sure the deal will go through so even less volume on them\n\n\nBull hopium:\n\nI personally believe a big market drop is coming. once uncertainty is peaked i feel like money will flow back into SPACs where we have the certainty of the NAV floor when everything else will seem like a gamble of which way price will move\n\nThis huge drop in SPACs over the last months may just be the big boys dumping on us only to cause FUD and even lower prices for them to buy back in when the time is right\n\nMy personal approach:\nBeen rapped hard core on warrants without any kind of lube and decided to sell the ones i am uncertain about and double down on the ones i have conviction in but yet is at a \"safer\" price. I refuse to buy any warrants over .80 and will continue to avoid till i see some kind of life in SPACs again. currently 1/3rd of my portfolio is in warrants and I'm seriously considering making it 2/3rds of my portfolio with current prices\n\nI will or will not wait for target announcements depending on % gains.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor nor is this financial advice, make your own decisions. Data from PLTR's latest 10-K &amp; 10-Q. \n\nPosition: long shares of stock @ $24.67 and have over doubled my position since Mar-21\n\nTL;DR \u2013 still bullish on PLTR and buying shares on down days. Financials improving each quarter. Waiting for the breakout.\n\nMy analysis primarily focuses on the financials of PLTR AFTER stripping out the Stock Based Compensation (SBC). For more background on this check my last post about it, but basically, I don\u2019t believe the market should be putting so much weight on this when analyzing the financial health of the company: . Also, the fact that PLTR is allowed to present financial data in their 10-K &amp; 10-Q filings after stripping out SBC shows that this is how the company should be analyzed. See previous post for more info on that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lygxog/why\\_pltr\\_is\\_still\\_a\\_growth\\_tech\\_stock\\_you\\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lygxog/why_pltr_is_still_a_growth_tech_stock_you_still/)\n\nActuals = true GAAP results\n\nAdjusted = financials after stripping out SBC\n\nAnyways, here are the numbers and keep in mind that Q3-20 experienced abnormally high costs from when PLTR went public:\n\n[Actual amounts including SBC \\(Stock Based Compensation\\)](https://preview.redd.it/f89bxnxotxk71.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18c71e76d43e71627113286e8047fb92695908c8)\n\n[Actual QoQ change](https://preview.redd.it/og81btk2uxk71.png?width=855&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e80a99f59b4d9c9848fc5d2dbfdf3e5915b82a6)\n\n[Actual QoQ change](https://preview.redd.it/zqom7kk3uxk71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f5d37f2ac900472b609c9942d3794d34362acd1)\n\nRevenue, COGS, Gross profit are all improving minus Q3-20 when the company experienced a significant amount of non-recurring costs due to its IPO. Revenue growth is still strong QoQ at 10.1% and 49% since Q2-20.\n\nEBITDA is looking quite strong as this is now the 6th straight quarter of positive EBITDA. Additionally, EBITDA as a % of Revenue continues to grow which shows the company\u2019 ability to grow profitability as they scale. \n\n[Actual Quarterly EBITDA](https://preview.redd.it/vcnaodw7uxk71.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c8a930914bf29e94fb2b50b30fd75c752cee62)\n\n[Actual Quarterly EBITDA](https://preview.redd.it/asymtbh9uxk71.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d47e4537f90ad3939069e1aff360228d62c8339)\n\nOn an adjusted basis, Revenue and Gross Profit continues to expand while SG&amp;A costs have remained constant: \n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/8sqbzt4cuxk71.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abcddd88b75ca0201593b075c5c12cd5b5fd22ee)\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/j7mlqk4euxk71.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b84796043a6b06c37bb2fe2753d99a9ca2ce97fe)\n\nTo expand upon the adjusted costs of the company, PLTR is proving it is on the right track toward sustained profitability as their operating costs have remained constant while simultaneously expanding revenue and gross profit. This also means that the company is continuing to prove profitability as the costs as a % of revenue are trending lower and lower each period:\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/aifydkoguxk71.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c70f95b7c4c2799ca9b1018a78ebd67f5390e410)\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/0wxbcsuiuxk71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a83b428f2913b788b08d5e33e429cf0274e45fbe)\n\nLastly, EPS on an adjusted basis has been positive for the past 3 quarters: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/co4bp5imuxk71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ae4ef1577f3f83c38c76935e3b094fd1a4a2f18\n\nQuick Balance Sheet Look:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plzqpizsuxk71.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d8b4134ebcbbfec54c9933d7f68bf4fe345203\n\nThis was the first Quarter that PLTR has reported $0 debt and have $2.3B in cash \u2013 quite impressive for a growth stock. Additionally, their current ratio and d/e ratios show no signs of liquidity/solvency issues (as expected).\n\nIn Summary: These posts don't generally focus on the qualitatives, but I have read almost nearly only great news about this company in the past 6 months yet the stock continues to get beaten down. The stock appears to be mainly being hurt due to 1) inflation fears, 2) differing opinions on valuation, and 3) stock based compensation criticism. However, none of these factors have an impact on the CORE operations of PLTR which I believe to be are extremely strong and all trending on the correct path. If long term investors can stay strong and continue to buy into this weakness, I think they will be happy they did so in 2-5 years\u2019 time. I will be curious to see if PLTR can break out of the 27.50 resistance or if it will fail that level and retest the low 20s again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kxiezztzwxk71.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c7c17ebb173e1681a0ba6abb87e73f6353a8854",

As organizations advance on their journey of improving their customers' digital experience, adopting zero-trust security environments, and deploying more cloud applications, they continue to turn to Okta to deliver an unmatched array of modern identity solutions to meet these challenges.\"\n\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Highlights:\n\nRevenue: Total revenue was $316 million, an increase of 57% year-over-year.

On an Okta standalone basis, excluding Auth0 and the effect of the billings process improvements, calculated billings increased 47% year-over-year.\n\nGAAP Operating Loss:\u00a0GAAP operating loss was $263 million, or 83% of total revenue, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $45 million, or 23% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Income/Loss:\u00a0Non-GAAP operating loss was $25 million, or 8% of total revenue, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $6 million, or 3% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nGAAP Net Loss:\u00a0GAAP net loss was $277 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of $60 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.11, compared to non-GAAP basic net income per share of $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.07 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nCash Flow: Net cash used in operations was $3 million, or (1)% of total revenue, compared to net cash provided by operations of $11 million, or 5% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was negative $4 million, or (1)% of total revenue, compared to $7 million, or 3% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\u00a0were $2.47 billion at July 31, 2021.\n\nThe section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.\n\nFinancial Outlook:\n\nOkta's financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:\n\nTotal revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and\n\nNon-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.\n\nFor the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:\n\nTotal revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and\n\nNon-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.\n\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\nOkta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta\u2019s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nConference Call Information:\n\nOkta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company\u2019s website at\u00a0investor.okta.com\u00a0prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at\u00a0investor.okta.com.\n\nSupplemental Financial and Other Information:\n\nSupplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company\u2019s investor relations website at\u00a0investor.okta.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nThis press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.\n\nOkta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nThe principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOkta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company\u2019s business.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m writing about this trade here to see if there\u2019s something I missed that would make this a trade I should reconsider (we can never be too careful after all). Last night, I noticed that FBRX had some volatility with some pretty high options premiums. Immediately, that September 17 15-strike put caught my eye: with the stock trading in the upper 20s, it was the farthest OTM put, and it was selling at an attractive 4.00 bid.\n\nI did some quick research on the company. Its fundamentals are shaky at best, but it seems like its technicals are solid enough. It has strong support in the 23.5-25 range, so that reduces the chance of it tumbling all the way to 15 (where it hasn\u2019t been since 2019). I looked for news and found that it had its earnings report this past month, so no risk of gambling earnings between now and the expiration date. Unfortunately, a quick Google search yielded its latest news story as two weeks old.\n\nI decided to take a chance and sold two puts at the 15-strike level hoping to collect the premiums once it expires, but I still want to check to see if there\u2019s something I may have missed. Does it have any significant upcoming events in the next two weeks to explain this high premium, or is it just volatility and theta? Can anyone find anything that would scream \u201cbad move; get out ASAP before you get stuck bag holding\u201d?",

There is another signal they are getting closer to being controlled by public, .they are \"cleaning\" their platform. \n\nLet's just say, a friend of mine, definitely not me, has been presented with questions on subreddits asking to report any nsfw content. why would reddit want to know or care? Marketing. By cleaning house, deleting subreddits that serve only NSFW content, it becomes instantly more attractive to the public.\n\nI think they may join the path of least resistance and merge with a company to take them public and continue to spend time and energy on cleaning up and pushing their already growing revenue channel. \n\nI'm interested in your thoughts on 1)if they will go public and 2) How will they  decide to do it if they do.",

        "selftext": "**What's UWMC (United Wholesale Mortgage Company):**\n\n* UWMC was a former private company brought public through a SPAC under GHIV\n* UWMC is the second largest mortgage company in the US (#1 is RKT) and the largest mortgage wholesaler in the US\n* Went public in order to generate more capital and aggressively expand and develop their business to takeover the #1 spot    \n\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnovrwc55yk71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65ef8f58afdfb178f316d5536fa1101c2eb438e8\n\n  \nRSI is normal   \nMACD shows a weak buy signal   \nStochastics shows a neutral signal   \nstock price is in the lower range of the Keltner Channel   \ndeath cross (50MA under 200MA) is present (bearish indicator)    \n\n\nResistance at $7.46, $7.60, $8.25, $8.89 and $10   \nSupport at $7.31    \n\n\nNot gonna lie, the technicals aren't looking very good for this company.  So why am I mentioning this company?  Because there's good reason to believe that a short/gamma squeeze is possible with the current setup based on the call share structure, option chains, and upcoming catalysts.    \n\n\n**Short Squeeze Setup**  \nThere's currently 88 million shares available as the public float with short interest at 10 million shares ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc?mod=quote_search)). Institutions hold about 28million shares ([source](https://fintel.io/so/us/uwmc)).  Meaning the public float is only about 60 million shares, making it a low float and easier to move up the stock price.    \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqgen2z65yk71.png?width=1435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=558e331520740c0379cc614ec9555d362c4c381e\n\nTake a good look at the open interests in the number $8 call options.  Add up the call options $9 calls on top, and you have over 50k in open interests for September 17th call options. [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/UWMC/options?date=1631836800&amp;p=UWMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/UWMC/options?date=1631836800&amp;p=UWMC)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tutor1185yk71.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3b43f98467028a237d2c5b091c38a5bee59db9\n\nNow take a look at the average trade volume ([approximately 4 million](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/UWMC?p=UWMC)).  It's not hard to figure out MMs and Institutions are shorting the stock and are manipulating the stock price to keep it below $8 to have all those call options expire worthless.    \n\n\n**Upcoming catalysts:**   \n\\- Ex-dividend date is September 9th for their $0.40/annual dividend ($0.10 for this quarter).   \n\\- Dividend Payout is October 6th.  \n\\- UWMC accepting cryptocurrency by the end of September ([source](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/might-soon-pay-mortgage-bitcoin-201000119.html))   \n\\- $300 Million in share buybacks ([source](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/uwm-holdings-corporation-announces-first-201500759.html))    \n\n\nNow if you add in the number of shares being shorted (approximately 10 million shares) with them having to return those shares by the ex-dividend date (September 9th), along with the open interests in both the $8 and $9 calls (50k x 100 = 5 million shares).   That's 15 million shares, or one quarter of the public float.  If trade volume ever exceeded 10 million, than we would have enough momentum to generate a short/gamma squeeze on this stock.",

        "selftext": "Disclosure: I currently own 26,000 shares of Zen.v at a $2.9 CAD cost-basis, writer of the article also retains a long position on the stock at hand.\n\nI have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.\n\nEdited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.\n\n**Short term Risks:**\n\nHC Approval. In the short term, it\u2019s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-\n\n(more questions that delay things beyond, let\u2019s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection \u2013 neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)\n\n\\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as \u201cInning 1.\u201d If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan\u2019s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.\n\n**Investment Thesis:**\n\n***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.\n\nRisks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.\n\nThe business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a \"must own\" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.\n\n**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**\n\nZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (\u201cgraphene-enhanced\u201d technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won\u2019t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Three Initial Target Markets:**\n\n*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*\n\n1. Personal Protective Equipment (\"PPE,\" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),\n2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and\n3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let\u2019s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.\n\n**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**\n\nZEN\u2019s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.\n\nThe next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company\u2019s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN\u2019s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.\n\n**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**\n\nThis is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That\u2019s when things are \u201cnormal\u201d (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.\n\nThere are over 6,000 hospitals.\n\nThere are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.\n\nThere are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.\n\nAnd all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.\n\n**Detection and Sensors:**\n\nThe company\u2019s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.\n\nImagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.\n\nPlease see the company\u2019s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.\n\n**Therapeutics:**\n\nDown the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won\u2019t cost much to pursue in the short term, I\u2019ll address them at a later time.\n\n**The Model:**\n\nThe company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in \u201cmasks equivalent\u201d (\u201cme\u201d). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.\n\n**Margins:**\n\nAssuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we\u2019re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.\n\n**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.\n\n**Expenses:**\n\nExpect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they\u2019re hiring at least a few heads.\n\nFor the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they\u2019ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.\n\n**Capex:**\n\nAssume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.\n\nObviously, since they\u2019re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.\n\nLet\u2019s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they\u2019re selling out the 25M mpd. That\u2019s:\n\n25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue\n\nx 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)\n\nx 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)\n\n= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)\n\n(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nWith $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn\u2019t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company\u2019s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.\n\nI\u2019m okay with that: a company that doesn\u2019t need to raise money won\u2019t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don\u2019t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.\n\nIf they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.\n\n**Misc:**\n\nLock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).\n\n**Insider Buying:**\n\nThe CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing \u201cmust have\u201d products, rather than \u201cnice to have\u201d ones.\n* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.\n* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.\n* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.\n* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.",

TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013 The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication \u2014 not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we\u2019re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s +10.6% .*\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.\n\n**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy?

        "selftext": "Alright, all caught up on why the fundamentals and cash flow generation make BGFV a fundamentals ATM? If not, put your La Croix and the September Good Housekeeping down and read for 5 minutes:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/pelvo1/bgfv\\_irrational\\_market\\_has\\_passed\\_this\\_one\\_by\\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/pelvo1/bgfv_irrational_market_has_passed_this_one_by_i/)\n\nThere has been a material shift in something important here that you NEED to follow: September call open interest and the possible setup of a gamma/short cover cycle. But let's recap for about 10 minutes first:\n\nRemember a few points from BGFV 101: \n\n**Low float with high institutional ownership:** 19.66 million share float, 56% institutional ownership at the end of Q2 (probably higher now). Why do we care? Most of these institutions are made up of **GIANT** ETFs and Russell index funds. They are not watching the tickers daily waiting for the right moment to buy or sell. They are building multi billion dollar portfolios that balance out market risk or track as a proxy to a certain sector or index. The ELI5 there: **Most of these are not selling any time soon!** Oh, and another point boys and girls. As stocks grow in market cap, they become eligible for inclusion in more indices and more ETFs that may have minimum market caps for inclusion. This can add fuel to a growth fire as more and more funds want a piece of a rising small cap that they couldn't previously add. Look at the funds buying in Q2: [https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/bgfv/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/bgfv/ownership)\n\nNotice a trend? Most of the largest funds adding are Russell 2000 funds from a previous position of 0. BGFV was re-added to the Russell 2000 and just like that, \\~1,000,000 shares get snapped up. Microcap funds or others may drop it, and some did. But fund ownership almost always increases with market cap, especially as they gain membership in more large indicies. Gains beget more tutes buying in and high velocity share supply contracts.\n\n***Shares in play impact:*** We're at 56% now, but let's shave a few points off and say that we'll assume 40% of issuance owned right now excluding recent moves since reporting and high turnover funds. I think it is likely to move up from 56% the longer we hold over $500 million and future market cap milestones. But I'll invoke the Santorum rule and go conservative. \n\n40% of issuance = 9 million shares unlikely to move in the short term. 19.66 million float drops to \\~10.6 million in play.\n\n**Shares on Loan to Shorts:** We don't know where the loaned shares are sourced from for the short interest. But we do know where some of it is NOT. Index and Mutual funds are prohibited by law from loaning out more than 50% of their unlevered positions to lend out to shorts. With \\~10 million total with tutes, we can say that in a worst case scenario the shorts borrowed ALL available shares from institutions (5 million out of 7.7 million). \n\nBut that worst case scenario is not reality. Big tutes have reported somewhere in the range of 1-10% of their holdings being loaned out. Vanguard, the biggest dog, I found reported 2% on their largest funds. They could have loaned more of some stocks and less than others. But the interest rate on lending BGFV has been sitting between 0 and 1% for most of 2020/2021, the period when shorts were building their positions. **There was no incentive to loan out more BGFV than anything else in the portfolio. The tutes actual share count lent to shorts is very likely WELL under 1 million.** \n\nSantorum rule: we'll round up to 1 million double counted and pull that out. 7.7 million shorts minus 1 million = 6.7 million shares locked up with brokers not counted in institutional ownership. These shares can only be sold if the lending broker in turn replaces them by pulling from their pool of owned shares (which they likely hold very little BGFV given its small market cap and historical volume) or buying shares on open market to replace them, effectively offsetting the price impact of the selling shareholder. This is NOT a 1:1 removal of shares from the open market, especially if market selling volume takes off. But when more of the pressure is on the buy side with lending brokers and/or volume remains low-ish, it's like a cushion underneath the stock to soften drops from sales of sold shares. That downward price pressure is already baked in when the original short transaction took place.\n\nSo we've got 10.6 million moving around outside the tutes and \\~6.7 million market sells worth of downward price pressure already baked in. The market is a weird thing, but we are set up so that only about **4 million** shares in the short term are changing hands in a way that meaningfully impacts the price. \n\n**How many shares are shorted again? Oh, they shorted 7.7 million? Those are going to be tough to close out should upward price movement force your hand. Would be a damn shame if you had to do so at a price significantly over the current market price.**\n\n**Which brings me to my last topic for today: Gamma.** September $30 call interest has grown significantly over the last few trading days. I believe I remember seeing 4,400 on Monday and now see over 7,600 contracts open. That is 760,000 shares that will need to be assigned if all contracts are exercised. That doesn't happen, but open interest is growing so quickly that even a 25% assignment rate at expiration is going to put some seriously **MAGNIFIED** upward price pressure when there may only 4 million shares out there up for grabs. If we clear $35 we are already looking at 3,400 open interest for September (and rising). We could be looking at 500,000+ shares of buy side pressure landing near options expiration date date of September 17th. \n\nNone of this takes in account any of the following:\n\n* Retail is buying this shit up lately. The more retail HODLs, the tighter the supply, the more violent the price action is likely to get. \n* Most of the managers and corporate employees have a VERY long tenure per their last 10-K filing. BGFV has also run an employee stock incentive program for some time. It's hard to say how many are owned by non-insider-reported employees, but it is certainly above zero and possibly immaterial to the very tight supply. How many \"*Fred-the-25-year-store-manager-that-has-been-accumulating-since-the-IPO-in-2002-and-won't-sell-until-retirement\"* are there taking even more supply off the market that we can't even account for?\n* Synthetics and naked shorts. The supply could be much larger than estimated if a significant share of the shorted shares are synth or naked. My not-financial-advice opinion in this case is: If they aren't synth or naked, fuck 'em and squeeze 'em. And if they are manipulating the supply with naked shorts, fuck 'em even more and sqeeze 'em harder.\n* Shorts commitment to fighting: We aren't talking about tens of billions of dollars with small cap BGFV. Large funds aren't likely to get margin called here. They probably have enough cash to keep their positions funded if they want to fighgt or wait sitting on a huge paper loss. But all it takes is a few big players to say 'fuck this, I'm out. You win Retail' for the window of escape to collapse.\n* What was posted is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in the rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it. We award you no karma, and may God have mercy on your soul.\n\n**So go read the fundamentals from part 1 again, take a cold shower, and ask yourself if you are ready to strap your goddamn seat belts on and moon this shit.**\n\nNone of this is financial advice. I am not a broker, insider, registered Libertarian, or Costco member. Do not act on my advice alone. I am merely sharing my opinion based on publicly available data. I might be wrong, I might be right, I just may be the lunatic you're looking for.\n\nI like the stock.",

        "selftext": "Disclosure: I currently own 26,000 shares of Zen.v at a $2.9 CAD cost-basis, writer of the article also retains a long position on the stock at hand.\n\nI have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.\n\nEdited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.\n\n**Short term Risks:**\n\nHC Approval. In the short term, it\u2019s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-\n\n(more questions that delay things beyond, let\u2019s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection \u2013 neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)\n\n\\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as \u201cInning 1.\u201d If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan\u2019s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.\n\n**Investment Thesis:**\n\n***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.\n\nRisks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.\n\nThe business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a \"must own\" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.\n\n**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**\n\nZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (\u201cgraphene-enhanced\u201d technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won\u2019t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Three Initial Target Markets:**\n\n*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*\n\n1. Personal Protective Equipment (\"PPE,\" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),\n2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and\n3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let\u2019s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.\n\n**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**\n\nZEN\u2019s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.\n\nThe next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company\u2019s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN\u2019s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.\n\n**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**\n\nThis is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That\u2019s when things are \u201cnormal\u201d (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.\n\nThere are over 6,000 hospitals.\n\nThere are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.\n\nThere are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.\n\nAnd all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.\n\n**Detection and Sensors:**\n\nThe company\u2019s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.\n\nImagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.\n\nPlease see the company\u2019s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.\n\n**Therapeutics:**\n\nDown the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won\u2019t cost much to pursue in the short term, I\u2019ll address them at a later time.\n\n**The Model:**\n\nThe company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in \u201cmasks equivalent\u201d (\u201cme\u201d). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.\n\n**Margins:**\n\nAssuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we\u2019re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.\n\n**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.\n\n**Expenses:**\n\nExpect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they\u2019re hiring at least a few heads.\n\nFor the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they\u2019ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.\n\n**Capex:**\n\nAssume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.\n\nObviously, since they\u2019re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.\n\nLet\u2019s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they\u2019re selling out the 25M mpd. That\u2019s:\n\n25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue\n\nx 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)\n\nx 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)\n\n= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)\n\n(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nWith $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn\u2019t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company\u2019s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.\n\nI\u2019m okay with that: a company that doesn\u2019t need to raise money won\u2019t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don\u2019t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.\n\nIf they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.\n\n**Misc:**\n\nLock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).\n\n**Insider Buying:**\n\nThe CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing \u201cmust have\u201d products, rather than \u201cnice to have\u201d ones.\n* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.\n* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.\n* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.\n* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.",

        "selftext": "# Corsair Gaming\n\nThe **COVID-19** has accelerated gaming activity and companies in this segment saw a dramatic **surge** in sales. I've been looking for a gaming company to invest in for a while now, and after an extensive research I realized that the best pick in this sector is **Corsair.**With a market cap of **$2.71B**, **$1.7B** in sales (2020) and **massive revenue growth** in past 2 years, **Corsair,** is the natural selection for those who are looking to add a **gaming exposure** to their portfolio.\n\n***Company's overview :***\n\n*Th*e company designs and manufacture gaming and streaming products, **Corsair** offer their user a vast verity of products : gaming Key boards and mice, headsets, audio equipment,  gaming PCs and many more. **Corsair** operates in 75 countries, and delivered 190M gaming and streaming products.The company's CEO - Andy Paul, is actually one of Corsair\u2019s co-founders (established in 1994).\n\n***Company's Financials:*****Corsair** reported **second-quarter 2021** earnings on August 3 before the market opened, with a **24% YOY revenue growth**, all thanks to the gaming segment - **40.9% YOY revenue growth** from gamers equipment sales and **17.6% YOY revenue growth** in the gaming components.***But,*** investors must take into account that **not all roses** with **Corsair**'s financials, **Corsair's EBITA** grew only 4% YOY even though revenue grew 24% YOY. The main reason is an increase in logistics costs, including ocean and air freight.**Company's revenue** reached in **Q2-2021** to **$472,903M** while **cost of revenue accounts for 72% from revenue,** and **net income** reached only **$27M**, which is **6%** out of the total quarterly revenue\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**I**nvestors should also look at **Corsair's direct competition** financial healthiness\\*\\*,\\*\\* the $18B giant - ***Logitech ($LOGI)***,generated this Q $1.3B In sales and their **cost of revenue accounts for 55%,** which is a reasonable ratio in this segment, plus, **net income** reached to $186,641M ,which counts for 14\\*\\*%\\*\\* out of the total quarterly revenue\\*\\*.

In line with this, I have been investing in vertical farming (wich is going pretty well for now). Now I would like to increase my investment in the food sector with a stronger focus on traditional meat substitution. I have considered insect and seaweed/kelp derived food, but I am mostly interested mostly  the field of  Precision fermentation and Cellular Agriculture.\n\n What is your op. about this type of  food thechnology?\n\nDo you know any growth stocks related to these fields?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance\n\nDavid",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have some questions about options in the RBC Direct Investing practice accounts. I'm purely messing around now in an effort to learn, and despite thinking I wrapped my head around, looking at my portfolio holdings the next day has me more confused. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSituation and recap of what I've done below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- purchased 100 shares of company X, yesterday in Margin Practice account.\n\n\\- Selected  Sell to Open 1 Contract on those 100 shares, which in my understanding means I opened a covered call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Premium added up to $498 and indicates it was filled under my activity section. To my understanding this means someone purchased the covered call (or the system simulated someone purchasing it because it's a practice account).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at My Portfolio holdings the next day, I am more confused.\n\n\\- The stock moved past the strike price today (briefly), yet it looks like I still have the 100 shares under the account, meaning the option was not sold or exercised by the buyer, is this correct?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Yet under Portfolio Holdings it says the contract quantity is (-1) and Book cost says (-$498.80). Wouldn't it have been a positive $498 because I received a premium for the sale of the covered call? Also why is it telling me I have an unrealized loss of (-$221.20) when I am the one who sold the covered call?  Finally, the last price of this current contract appears to have gone-up from $4.988 to $7.20 yet the covered call I have seems to have unrealized losses. Is this because of the time decay on the contract?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny clarification you guys can provide, would be greatly appreciated. Also I know I'm not yet ready to trade real money, so I don't need the lecture. This is me attempting to learn, and make mistakes, and be comfortable with the process of selling options. I thought I had some of it down, but I'm clearly not there yet.",

        "selftext": "Okay you guys and gals, I'm back. Yes this has been a bloodbath. No getting around that.\n\nIn order for a squeeze to happen it requires 2 things: Public Interest &amp; Share Buying. \n\nInvestors often make the mistake of going \"well X factors and Y factors have happened so long as you've done the DD remain Bullish.\" The problem is that the general public are NOT investors and have no idea, nor are even aware of x or y factors. Those things simply have no affect on them. The general public is ONLY aware of hype. They have to see it enough, they have to hear it enough, they have to be shown proof that it's going...UP. That's right. While DD will keep investors happy to buy as the share price drops, a downward trend will scare off the general public. They only buy when things are going up. The stock has taken a beating and everyday has dripped down slowly but surely. That tells me that bulls are doing their best to hold on but even they are losing conviction by the hour. Thus the slow decline down. This stock needs a fresh new injection of public interest in order to spike up the price. Just the truth. Bulls have either spent all they can, or exited without plan to return in the near future. **The idea now is to flood YouTube Twitter Facebook etc with DD on $SPRT and well detailed explanations of WHY the si% increase is bullish- with examples and data given.** Target accounts with large followings, especially those related to energy/tech/crypto, because that's how you will reach the largest audiences possible. Tons of YouTube videos etc. That newfound sentiment has to be garnered. Write articles and publish them so people searching up the stock come across them. Things like that. Strategic planning. Just the truth. Eventually news will pick it up and wonder why so many articles have been written, why it's being discussed all over social media, etc. $GME at the beginning of the year had dedicated Bulls that ensured the public interest was extremely high. \n\nNext up is Share Buying. The concept is simple enough. Buy shares. Again Bulls are mostly spent. So this plays in tandem with the Public Interest support. Buying otm options at this point is a waste of money until this begins to trend upwards. \n\nWe have a long weekend coming up, monday is labor day. Every Friday the past month, the stock has spiked. It will happen again this Friday. Shorts generally do not like holding ver the weekend. They certainly will not want to hold over the long weekend. What am I saying? The best plan of action is to flood the internet and garner as much public interest on $SPRT by Friday. This will invoke a massive share buying process, forcing shorts to cover a higher si than before- with a lower float than before. Again the long weekend is coming up. If you read this, and are bullish, give at least one of those things a try. At the very least spread the general message as much as possible. Not just on reddit but across social media platforms. Again, the general public is the audience.",

        "selftext": "\nBare with me, a lot to uncover. \n\nI work in a drywall company and there has been constant price increases for MATERIAL over the past year starting since almost October of last year.\n\nDrywall, aluminum, lumber, insulation are all receiving price increases from the manufacturers.\n\nPart of the reason we saw material increases was so manufacturers could make up losses from COVID. Seems like they realized how much money they can make off of this and kept up the price increases, even if they broke even with the first increase. \n\nToday, we had our weekly meeting and our boss, owner of the company, was telling us that Mcstain Neighborhoods, a builder in Denver, CO has stopped their building because they weren\u2019t making any money on the last 5 houses they built. According to my boss, they had to write $20,000 checks in order to complete the house, racking up to a whopping $100,000 with just 5 houses.\n\nHere\u2019s why I wanna buy puts (not sure how far out though) \n\nBuilders are selling houses BEFORE they\u2019re built, on fixed prices. \n\nBut the house is already more expensive to build DURING production, resulting in a profit loss from the builder because they are now paying to build this house.\n\nExample:\n\n- Buyer picks a house model. Cost to build this house is $250,000\n\n- House sold at $400,000 - builder can\u2019t change price.\n\n- Constant price increases changed the build cost from $250,000 to $420,000. \n\n- Builder pays $20,000 to finish the house. \n\nHere we see one builder slow down its building because they are losing money when the house is closed. Building permits are DOWN 35% from last year. Building has been slowing down and it\u2019s only a matter of time until it comes to a halt.\n\nHow many more builders are going to follow? \n\nHow many builders right NOW are talking about slowing down building? \n\nIs this priced in?!?!??\n\nEvery month, there is a new price for our drywall, EVERY MONTH. \n\nMy prediction: Builders will come to a halt sometime in the next year, I\u2019d be surprised if it hasn\u2019t stopped by April of next year. These houses are getting too expensive to build and the builders who own all the land, are stopping production.\n\nMany things are going to happen here. \n\nMaterials for building will lose demand. Very very fast. \n\nPeople are going to temporarily lose jobs until prices come back down. \n\nProfits are gonna be off the table, who\u2019s making money if there\u2019s no work happening?!? Builders don\u2019t wanna pay that expensive Material! No material. No House. \n\nBUT, is this infrastructure bill only going to cause more inflation? Is every aspect of building going to be affected by the infrastructure bill? Only a few?\n\nPlease, be my guest and throw down some tract home builders, commercial builders, any that have a public traded stock. \n\nSo far, we work with Century Communities (CCS) , they are one of our builders with a publicly traded stock. Their price is sitting at $70.\n\nI would like to buy 6-8 month put contracts on this stock because im expecting building to slow down, and im expecting profits to fall off. \n\nBut is this already priced in? \n\nThere\u2019s money to be made during this transition of builders fighting against manufacturer pricing, but I would like some input on where you guys would put your money if building does happen to come to a halt. \n\nSide note: if you looked at my profile, you\u2019d see I\u2019ve made some dumb investments that my 19 year old self isn\u2019t too proud of. But I do eventually hope to seek a good understanding of the market and here I am witnessing the fuse getting closer to the bomb and trying to make money off of it. \n\nTLDR; Materials to build a house is getting expensive. Builders are starting to slow down their building until prices come back down. This may create a domino effect and cause many jobs to be off the grid temporarily. Puts on builder companies, material manufacturers, and all those rich corporations that build is my guess, not financial advice.",

Can some explain to me like I\u2019m 5 years old and can\u2019t color within the lines how and when I can buy back into this company without my buyin price hitting the atmosphere. plz and spank you.",

        "selftext": "I opened a position today, common shares and 10/15 $29C. Now let's proceed with the DD... \n\n## THE SHORT INTEREST\n\n**Comes in #1 on highshortinterest.com** with a short interest of 38.42%. \n\nOrtex, a proprietary software, that estimates short interest daily has short interest at 72%. \n\nIhor Dusaniwsky, Managing director for S3 Partners, has short interest at 9.89M shares or 49% of the 20.33 Float. \n\nYahoo Finance has FINRA reported data from 8/13/2021 with a short interest of 37.34%\n\nAll of the above are high enough to garner attention and create a short squeeze. \n\nSecondary data such as days to cover and borrow rate fee are very unreliable, but marketbeat has days to cover at 6 (very high), and fintel has a borrow rate of 33%. If days to cover is truly 6 days, that would result in a short squeeze like no other! A week to cover, imagine that. \n\n[Ortex Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/c0x4cg62rzk71.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e13720303e9296f992957086fb86653e077d7f4c)\n\n[Days to Cover - Marketbeat](https://preview.redd.it/n6p9b3dxqzk71.png?width=823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=826da1ed7c6ae6083d3b6ef03ede68f8c03f6d63)\n\n## THE VALUATION\n\nMarketcap is 715M. Shares outstanding is 22.42M. Float is 20.33M. Net sales last 6 months was $599M, up 34% YoY. Net Income last 6 months was $58M. Net Margins last 6 months was 9.7%, Net Sales last 3 months was $326M, up 43% YoY. Net Income last 3 months was $37M. Net Income Margins last 3 Moths was 11%. Using last 6 Months sales X2 = Annual Rev 2021 \\~ $1.25B up 20% YoY.  Annual Dividend Yield \\~3.5%. Balance Sheet confirms assets outweigh liabilities in short-term and long-term. \n\nAll Data pulled from SEC Filings\n\nConsidering the above, Forward Looking (FWD) metrics assuming a static shares outstanding of 22.42M, FY Rev of $1.25B, and Net Margins of 10%, would be the following:\n\nFY EPS: $5.57    \n\nP/E (FWD): 5.09        DKS P/E (TTM): 11.40\n\nP/S (FWD): 0.50        DKS P/S (TTM): 1.21\n\nValuation when compared to market averages and Dicks Sporting Goods, seems favorable. In my opinion, there is nothing in the fundamentals that supports such a high short interest. \n\n## STOCK PERFORMANCE\n\nPre-pandemic stock traded at around $4.0.  Post-pandemic stock hit a high of $37.75. Current share price is $32.77 Stock is currently up 8X from pre-pandemic levels. Stock Ex-dividend date was 8/31/2021 with payout of $0.25 per share. \n\nMy thoughts: Stock has outperformed the general market and 7X gains in under 2 years time is aggressive. However, based on current revenues the stock is not overvalued. Shorts might be high in this stock, because of the stock performance, the ex-dividend date which usually leads to a sell-off, and lack of faith in the business sector. Big 5 Sporting Goods deals with a lot of sporting equipment and camping equipment. There is belief that during the pandemic, people went camping more, bought more camping gear, and stocked up on camping gear; therefore, sales might decline in the future since people would have recently bought the products they needed or people would no longer have a need for them. Some of this might be true, and I would not be long-term investing because of those headwinds, but to have short interest of 30% or higher with the current valuation is unjust. \n\n# THE BOTTOM LINE\n\nThis is one of the highest shorted stocks right now. This stock has a low float of only 20M shares and a low market cap of around $700M. The valuation is undervalued compared to similar companies and market averages. Avg volume is 1.35M shares. Days to cover is reported at 6 days on marketbeat. \n\nIMO, give this stock the attention it deserves, watch the volume pick up, and this stock can squeeze to over $100 a share.",

And its stock is inexpensive. \nBy Eric J. Savitz \n\nThis should be a magical moment for Plantronics, the producer of conference-room products and office headsets, better known as Poly. \n\nWith a gradual return to the office, there is expected to be a surge in \"hybrid meetings\" -- mixing in-person and virtual participants. Poly CEO Dave Shull estimates that there are about 50 million conference rooms globally, and that 10% or less are equipped for videoconferencing. That is a huge potential opportunity for Poly (ticker: POLY) and its competitors. \n\nShares of Poly, meanwhile, have been driven down to bargain-basement levels by the fallout from an ill-fated merger three years ago. At a recent $32, the stock now trades for about 0.7 times anticipated revenue for the March 2023 fiscal year, and just under eight times projected profits for the same period. \n\nIn comparison, Logitech International (LOGI), which has an overlapping set of products, trades for about 3.2 times revenue and 22 times projected profits for the same period. \n\nAt such deeply discounted levels, investors willing to be patient could reap rich rewards as a turnaround gets underway at Poly.",

        "selftext": " \n\n22nd\u00a0Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops\n\nMassive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants.\u00a0**Now hops also?**\u00a0I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nInitiating coverage on\u00a0**22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),**\u00a0a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.\n\nCurrent price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)\n\nOn August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.\n\nWhen I look at\u00a0[the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st\u00a0the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today\u2019s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are\u00a0**approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.\n\nI often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company\u2019s success. Insider ownership isn\u2019t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares.\u00a0**Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company\u2019s shares.**\u00a0Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company\u2019s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it\u2019s infancy. XXII doesn\u2019t chase small markets.\n\nIn a\u00a0[letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html)\u00a0published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said \u201cI am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise \u2013 the global\u00a0**specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.\u201d\n\n95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.\n\nXXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.\n\nXXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.\n\n7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00\n\n**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA\u2019s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company\u2019s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN\u00ae King and VLN\u00ae Menthol King, including the headline claim of \u201c95% less nicotine.\u201d VLN\u00ae tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.\n\n**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century\u2019s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).\n\nThe XXII \u201ctrifecta\u201d of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an\u00a0**estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each\u00a0**1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.\n\nStay tuned for more coverage on 22nd\u00a0Century Group coming very soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 22nd Century Group, Inc.  \n22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA\u2019s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking.\u00a0**The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/exciting-report-in-a-hot-sector-coming-tomorrow-649728?e=[UNIQID])",
