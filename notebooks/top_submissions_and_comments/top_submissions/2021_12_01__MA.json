        "selftext": "Tickers: **VISA,** **MA**\n\nThey are both down 20%+ from their highs this year, improving the margin of safety. They still have a huge moat (each of these companies maintain operations in 200+ countries).\n\nBoth have a small dividend. Visa authorized an increase in theirs last week, with Mastercard doing the same yesterday. Mastercard has also approved a new $8B share repurchase program.\n\n**Visa and Amazon Dispute**\n\nFor Amazon in the U.K, Visa cards only account for 7% of transactions, the smallest share of all card purchases. Amazon U.K primarily uses Mastercard for payments. For Amazon in the US, Visa is the dominant card.\n\nThey have specifically targeted the country that would impact them the least. Visa has also faced much more impactful restrictions from companies such as Walmart and Kroger and they ended up settling those disputes privately. It's clearly just a negotiation tactic from Amazon.\n\n**Interest Rate Risk**\n\nThese companies derive revenue from client services, data processing, cross-border transactions, and value-added services, such as licensing fees. Meaning they have less exposure to interest-rate risk as they neither earn revenue from or bear any risk tied to the interest or fees paid by cardholders.",

        "selftext": "To preface this, I'm only advising this for young investors, 18-25.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of reddit is quick to recommend you throw all of your money into an ETF, but I disagree. In my opinion, ETFs are more for preserving wealth. Individual stocks is where you gain that wealth. When you're at a young age, your risk tolerance should be way higher than when you're in your 40s. I'm not saying gamble your money on a high-risk penny stock, but you should be putting most of your portfolio in individual stocks. Find a few sectors you like, and find companies within those sectors that have historically performed well and have positive earnings growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will take 5 sectors and compare popular stocks within those sectors against the 1-year performance of the S&amp;P500 \n\nEnergy: \n\nXOM - 52%\n\nCVX - 28%\n\nCOP - 72%\n\nMRO - 151%\n\nSU - 45%\n\nTotal 1yr performance : 69%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndustrials:\n\nLPX - 94%\n\nSEB - 17%\n\nOC - 20%\n\nBLDR - 104%\n\nNLSN - 15%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 51%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancial:\n\nMA - (-5%)\n\nSOFI - 57%\n\nAXP - 27%\n\nPYPL - (12%)\n\nV - (5%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 12%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShipping:\n\nZIM - 376%\n\nSBLK - 157%\n\nGOGL - 125%\n\nTGH - 87%\n\nSTNG - 12%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 151%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnology:\n\nNVDA - 139%\n\nNFLX - 24%\n\nAMD - 63%\n\nNET - 124%\n\nINTC - (3%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 70%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Total 1yr performance of all these stocks combined: 71%**\n\n**Total 1yr performance of the S&amp;P500: 25%**\n\nPicking individual stocks nearly tripled the performance of the S&amp;P500 over the course of a year. While you did take on more risk, this should be considered encouraged at a younger age. As you get older you should gradually move portions of your portfolio over to more blue chips and ETFs. Anyways, I constantly see people saying only to put stocks into ETFs, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts.",
