        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 29, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. \n\nBloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management\u2019s family office and a so-called \u201cTiger cub\u201d (the name Wall Street gave to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a \u201csignificant hit\u201d following Archegos Capital\u2019s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.\n\nDespite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week\u2019s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. \n\nThe United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered [in his first 100 days](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/). Before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021). \n\nIn other news, the Ever Given, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal, a critical artery in global trade, was finally dislodged. The week-long blockade cost roughly $9 billion a day in lost revenue.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The data are[ expected to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) \u2014 the most since October 2019 and the best the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* Comcast (CMCSA) will now offer Disney+ and ESPN+ in its Xfinity platform.\n* DraftKings (DKNG) and the World Wrestling Federation entered into an agreement to make the sports betting company the official gaming partner of the WWE. This follows a deal DKNG made with the UFC recently.\n* United Airlines (UAL). said it is returning to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City after a five-year hiatus. With the resumption of operations out of JFK, the airline now offers service from the three major airports in the NYC area, the company said Monday.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price is written in the morning and does not account for intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) target raised by Bank of America from $140 to $150 at Buy.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, March 15th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-15-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks set to rise after record closes for Dow and S&amp;P 500\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures pushed higher Monday even as the 10-year Treasury yield held around 1.63%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs Friday. The Nasdaq fell modestly as recently slumping tech stocks continued to fight rising bond yields. However, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all posted strong weekly gains. Ahead of Monday\u2019s open, the Nasdaq was up more than 3.3% for the year. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were up 7% and almost 5%, respectively in 2021.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Bitcoin takes breather after surge to over $60,000\n\n&gt; * Bitcoin dropped 6% on Monday, after jumping Saturday to another all-time high \u2014 this time above $60,000. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency has just about doubled this year. It\u2019s soared more than 1,000% over the past 12 months. Bitcoin\u2019s market value climbed back above $1 trillion last week. The incredible rally has been driven by increased adoption by larger institutional investors and firms as well as speculative demand.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Treasury yields near 1-year highs ahead of Fed meeting\n\n&gt; * While the 10-year Treasury yield was actually a bit lower Monday morning, it was only slightly below its more than one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. The rapid rise in yields this year has traders wondering whether the Federal Reserve may be losing control of the direction of interest rates. The Fed\u2019s two-day March meeting begins Tuesday, with questions about how long near-zero rates and extraordinarily easy Covid monetary policy can last.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Biden and Harris to sell $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan\n\n&gt; * The Fed is expected to forecast better economic growth after last week\u2019s signing by President Joe Biden of the $1.9 trillion package of fiscal measures designed to help Americans, U.S. businesses and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the pandemic. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the road this week to sell the Covid stimulus plan, which includes up to $1,400 in direct payments to many people.\n\n&gt; * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland\u2019s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world\u2019s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday\u2019s premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Fauci warns against lifting U.S. restrictions right now\n\n&gt; * White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning state leaders that the nation\u2019s battle with the coronavirus is still \u201cnot in the end zone.\u201d He urged Americans to adhere to public health measures despite the ramp-up of vaccinations, pointing to new infection spikes in Europe as a cautionary tale of relaxing too soon. As of Sunday night, the CDC reported that nearly 37.5 million people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated \u2014 more than 11% of the nation\u2019s population of over 330 million.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://i.imgur.com/FAhhnsR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/jzI7nmQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Yj4c66b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/DeotZjy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/sSD4nkM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/GnLXyAH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BtbQK1p.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7Wcl6PV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TEJAfPF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wnSTJ2O.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* RIDE\n* ALGO.X\n* AMC\n* EBON\n* NGA\n* NLSP\n* DKNG\n* GNRS\n* BB\n* HOGE.X\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-genmark-diagnostics-amc-entertainment-eli-lilly-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK)** \u2013 GenMark will be bought by Swiss drugmaker Roche for $1.8 billion in cash, or $24.05 per share.

It is a lesser known well run company with bigger potential upside on positive news. \n\nThe company has a great balance sheet.

I\u2019m directing senior officials in my administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate.  They\u2019ve authorized the bill, but they need $37 billion, short term, to make sure we have this capacity.\"\n\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/02/24/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-an-executive-order-on-supply-chains/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/02/24/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-an-executive-order-on-supply-chains/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill TSEM benefit from executive orders? I don't know. Will there even be executive orders with support and incentives? Can't be sure. \n\nMy idea is simple, maybe too simple, but basically, a relatively small cap company with a global footprint that actually makes the chips and has a great balance sheet could benefit greatly from government incentives and support to address the semiconductor shortage. The lack of semiconductors due to supply chain disruptions is the bottleneck that needs priority in order to support industries affected by the shortage. I believe the government will step in, and that TSEM might have the greatest upside of all the semiconductor manufacturers. \n\nIn conclusion, I like the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSemiconductor Shortage Media Awareness:\n\n[https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/chip-shortage-snarls-auto-output-worldwide](https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/chip-shortage-snarls-auto-output-worldwide)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2021/01/12/956097426/lack-of-computer-chips-trips-up-some-automakers](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/12/956097426/lack-of-computer-chips-trips-up-some-automakers)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/auto-factories-semiconductor-chips.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/auto-factories-semiconductor-chips.html)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/carmakers-have-been-hit-hard-by-a-global-chip-shortage-heres-why-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/carmakers-have-been-hit-hard-by-a-global-chip-shortage-heres-why-.html)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/how-covid-led-to-a-60-billion-global-chip-shortage-for-automakers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/how-covid-led-to-a-60-billion-global-chip-shortage-for-automakers.html)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsem-strong-demand-low-industry-100000249.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsem-strong-demand-low-industry-100000249.html)\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-order-review-supply-chains-vital-goods-watch-live-stream-today-2021-02-24/?fbclid=IwAR3d1TRvykRE3nwV\\_VKrKI1yPGQ7lxpGLD1IoK4YTwLDzgEYT\\_n5UUIlm-c](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-order-review-supply-chains-vital-goods-watch-live-stream-today-2021-02-24/?fbclid=IwAR3d1TRvykRE3nwV_VKrKI1yPGQ7lxpGLD1IoK4YTwLDzgEYT_n5UUIlm-c)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-supply-chains/biden-to-press-for-37-billion-to-boost-chip-manufacturing-amid-shortfall-idUSKBN2AO13D](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-supply-chains/biden-to-press-for-37-billion-to-boost-chip-manufacturing-amid-shortfall-idUSKBN2AO13D)",

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, March 15th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-15-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks set to rise after record closes for Dow and S&amp;P 500\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures pushed higher Monday even as the 10-year Treasury yield held around 1.63%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs Friday. The Nasdaq fell modestly as recently slumping tech stocks continued to fight rising bond yields. However, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all posted strong weekly gains. Ahead of Monday\u2019s open, the Nasdaq was up more than 3.3% for the year. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were up 7% and almost 5%, respectively in 2021.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. B/itcoin takes breather after surge to over $60,000\n\n&gt; * B/itcoin dropped 6% on Monday, after jumping Saturday to another all-time high \u2014 this time above $60,000. The world\u2019s biggest c/ryptocurrency has just about doubled this year. It\u2019s soared more than 1,000% over the past 12 months. B/itcoin\u2019s market value climbed back above $1 trillion last week. The incredible rally has been driven by increased adoption by larger institutional investors and firms as well as speculative demand.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Treasury yields near 1-year highs ahead of Fed meeting\n\n&gt; * While the 10-year Treasury yield was actually a bit lower Monday morning, it was only slightly below its more than one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. The rapid rise in yields this year has traders wondering whether the Federal Reserve may be losing control of the direction of interest rates. The Fed\u2019s two-day March meeting begins Tuesday, with questions about how long near-zero rates and extraordinarily easy Covid monetary policy can last.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Biden and Harris to sell $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan\n\n&gt; * The Fed is expected to forecast better economic growth after last week\u2019s signing by President Joe Biden of the $1.9 trillion package of fiscal measures designed to help Americans, U.S. businesses and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the pandemic. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the road this week to sell the Covid stimulus plan, which includes up to $1,400 in direct payments to many people.\n\n&gt; * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland\u2019s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world\u2019s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday\u2019s premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Fauci warns against lifting U.S. restrictions right now\n\n&gt; * White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning state leaders that the nation\u2019s battle with the coronavirus is still \u201cnot in the end zone.\u201d He urged Americans to adhere to public health measures despite the ramp-up of vaccinations, pointing to new infection spikes in Europe as a cautionary tale of relaxing too soon. As of Sunday night, the CDC reported that nearly 37.5 million people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated \u2014 more than 11% of the nation\u2019s population of over 330 million.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://i.imgur.com/FAhhnsR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/jzI7nmQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Yj4c66b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/DeotZjy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/sSD4nkM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/GnLXyAH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BtbQK1p.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7Wcl6PV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TEJAfPF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wnSTJ2O.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-genmark-diagnostics-amc-entertainment-eli-lilly-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK)** \u2013 GenMark will be bought by Swiss drugmaker Roche for $1.8 billion in cash, or $24.05 per share.

        "selftext": "My fellow autists, degenerates, gambling addicts, and of course, my dear retards: It is I - u/pltr_gang_rise_up and I am here to share with you a true post in the spirits of WallStreetBets and would like to put on your radar - SOXL. \n\n**Backstory:**\n\n**Semiconductors,** as most are aware, are in short supply. There has been some movement by world leaders to improve supply chains in order to get the semiconductors to the place they need to be. Some car manufacturers have had to cut production in vehicles due to this ongoing issue. I believe this issue will be fixed in due time, but probably not in the immediate future. \n\n**What is SOXL?**\n\n**SOXL** is a Leveraged ETF that invests in the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world (INTC, AMD, QCOM, TSM, etc). \n\nBe careful, this is a \"Leveraged\" ETF - and therefore it's rather aggressive and aiming for high returns. Do some more research here if you want. Essentially it means, if the sector of semiconductors does well, the fund will do well. \n\n**Breakdown:**\n\nNow, they recently had a 15:1 split on their shares, which were trading at about $636 in February. This brought the public float to **99.40M.**\n\nWhen looking into a company, I like to start with what they own, followed by who owns them.\n\n**What they own:**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the assets that SOXL owns with their 1.46bn market cap:\n\nDreyfus Government Cash Management Institutional Shs\t11.00%\n\nFinancial Square Treasury Instruments Fund FST Shares\t9.39%\n\nBroadcom Inc.\t5.22%\n\nQualcomm Inc.\t4.96%\n\nIntel Corp.\t4.94%\n\nTexas Instruments Inc.\t4.88%\n\nNVIDIA \t4.67%\n\nMicron Technology Inc.\t2.81%\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ADR\tTSM\t2.69%\n\nAnalog Devices Inc.\t2.54%\n\nApplied Materials Inc.\t2.51%\n\nLam Research Corp.\t2.50%\n\nKLA Corp.\t2.41%\n\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\t2.40%\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.\t2.37%\n\nASML Holding N.V.\t2.22%\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc.\t2.16%\n\nXilinx Inc.\t2.01%\t\n\nMarvell Technology Group Ltd.\t1.92%\n\nSkyworks Solutions Inc.\t1.53%\n\nTeradyne Inc.\t1.20%\n\nQorvo Inc.\t1.14%\n\nMonolithic Power Systems MPWR\t0.99%\n\nON Semiconductor Corp.\t0.81%\n\nEntegris Inc.\t0.78%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, I'm not sure what the first two are, but that throws up a potential flag.** These two entities represent nearly 20% of the portfolio owned. It could be nothing more than some type of government investment in such a company, as it is critical right now. \n\n**Who owns them?:**\n\nLooks like mostly hedge funds. No one really of note other than Citadel and Susquehanna. \n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nNot a heavily shorted stock. About 3.4m shares are available to short with a ratio of about 25%.\n\n**Technicals** (got me excited):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7ndly6se1m61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698eae9b1d4ff4726eac546d2a6a8f4bb753fbc6\n\nHere we have a bounce just under the (white) 200sma. On this 4h chart, the bottom represents the buy/sell volume over time. the middle represents where we're at in terms of a squeeze. You also can see heavy buy volume at the bottom followed by a potential turn up ahead in the next few days. TONS of buy volume since the beginning of the month. \n\nThe daily was also looking nice:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/id2j5879f1m61.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23cbb6a2b7af021cadc9d35a9d2f8413c636cb90\n\nThere is an AIM on the indicator, meaning at this point the next logical step might be a shot to the upside in the next week. There was heavy call and put volume on the $37 strike, which seemed quite coincidental. Why that level? There were more calls than puts. The OI is still over 10k on the option. \n\nMy target is $42 by 3/19. But I encourage you to do your own analysis and come up with your own targets. I happen to think this is a good potential trade. I think in this case, the probability in my belief is to the upside.",

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, March 15th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-15-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks set to rise after record closes for Dow and S&amp;P 500\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures pushed higher Monday even as the 10-year Treasury yield held around 1.63%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs Friday. The Nasdaq fell modestly as recently slumping tech stocks continued to fight rising bond yields. However, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all posted strong weekly gains. Ahead of Monday\u2019s open, the Nasdaq was up more than 3.3% for the year. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were up 7% and almost 5%, respectively in 2021.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Bitcoin takes breather after surge to over $60,000\n\n&gt; * Bitcoin dropped 6% on Monday, after jumping Saturday to another all-time high \u2014 this time above $60,000. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency has just about doubled this year. It\u2019s soared more than 1,000% over the past 12 months. Bitcoin\u2019s market value climbed back above $1 trillion last week. The incredible rally has been driven by increased adoption by larger institutional investors and firms as well as speculative demand.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Treasury yields near 1-year highs ahead of Fed meeting\n\n&gt; * While the 10-year Treasury yield was actually a bit lower Monday morning, it was only slightly below its more than one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. The rapid rise in yields this year has traders wondering whether the Federal Reserve may be losing control of the direction of interest rates. The Fed\u2019s two-day March meeting begins Tuesday, with questions about how long near-zero rates and extraordinarily easy Covid monetary policy can last.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Biden and Harris to sell $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan\n\n&gt; * The Fed is expected to forecast better economic growth after last week\u2019s signing by President Joe Biden of the $1.9 trillion package of fiscal measures designed to help Americans, U.S. businesses and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the pandemic. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the road this week to sell the Covid stimulus plan, which includes up to $1,400 in direct payments to many people.\n\n&gt; * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland\u2019s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world\u2019s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday\u2019s premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Fauci warns against lifting U.S. restrictions right now\n\n&gt; * White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning state leaders that the nation\u2019s battle with the coronavirus is still \u201cnot in the end zone.\u201d He urged Americans to adhere to public health measures despite the ramp-up of vaccinations, pointing to new infection spikes in Europe as a cautionary tale of relaxing too soon. As of Sunday night, the CDC reported that nearly 37.5 million people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated \u2014 more than 11% of the nation\u2019s population of over 330 million.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://i.imgur.com/FAhhnsR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/jzI7nmQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Yj4c66b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/DeotZjy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/sSD4nkM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/GnLXyAH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BtbQK1p.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7Wcl6PV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TEJAfPF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wnSTJ2O.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* RIDE\n* ALGO.X\n* AMC\n* EBON\n* NGA\n* NLSP\n* DKNG\n* GNRS\n* BB\n* HOGE.X\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-genmark-diagnostics-amc-entertainment-eli-lilly-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK)** \u2013 GenMark will be bought by Swiss drugmaker Roche for $1.8 billion in cash, or $24.05 per share.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 29, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. \n\nBloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management\u2019s family office and a so-called \u201cTiger cub\u201d (the name Wall Street gave to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a \u201csignificant hit\u201d following Archegos Capital\u2019s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.\n\nDespite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving.

        "selftext": "Has anyone heard of this company?  On paper, or seems to have the makings of something huge.  Last year, EROS was a top Bollywood media streaming company that merged with STX films, the creator of movies like Greenland and the foreigner.  Since the initial merger, the price crashed to 2 and has been hovering ever since, as institutions have been loading up.  Despite Greenland becoming a blockbuster hit, the price hasn't changed much in last few weeks but the institutional ownership seems to be growing continuously.  \n\nIs this an indicator that the price is being manipulated?  For anyone who has been investing into this stock, what sort of price target would you put on it?",
