        "selftext": "**TLDR;** Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus - analysts haven\u2019t caught up yet from Q4 Earning report; add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward. On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet.\n\nFair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don\u2019t worry my fellow ape brethren I\u2019ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let\u2019s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop\u2019s transition.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n# Chapter 1: Gamestop\u2019s Advantage in its Transition to Online.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431\n\nAnd this is the key misstep the HF\u2019s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They\u2019ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can\u2019t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it\u2019s expensive). They can\u2019t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn\u2019t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it\u2019s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn\u2019t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.\n\nBecause of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.\n\n# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth\n\nIt is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092\n\nSo what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he\u2019s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy\u2019s online sales figures under Cohen to project what\u2019s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e\n\nThat\u2019s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.\n\nGamestop Announced in it\u2019s Q4 earnings report last week what it\u2019s intentions are... *\u201cOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.\u201d*\n\nWhich brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics &amp; Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 3: Electronics &amp; Media Sales\n\nIf you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it\u2019s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics &amp; Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon\u2019s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723\n\nAmazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it\u2019s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon\u2019s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn\u2019t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.\n\nSo let\u2019s get to the fun part\u2026 valuation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?\n\nValuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I\u2019ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.\n\nGamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)\u2026 we\u2019re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let\u2019s look at the figures anyway and then I\u2019ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it\u2019s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm\u2026 why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop\u2019s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now\u2026 it would move it\u2019s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That\u2019s not a squeeze number. That\u2019s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ipbngvoireq61...*\n\nSo let\u2019s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I\u2019ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it\u2019s P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You\u2019ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it\u2019s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it\u2019s online business, it\u2019s P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Chapter: Conclusions\n\nOk you\u2019ve been patient, and I told you I\u2019d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn\u2019t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it\u2019s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?\n\nWell **$191**, that\u2019s what it\u2019s trading at. It\u2019s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don\u2019t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn\u2019t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It\u2019s because of quality, and support for the brand.\n\nLots of things are increasing Gamestop\u2019s valuation, but growth of it\u2019s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I\u2019m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop\u2019s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is\u2026 an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics &amp; Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.\n\nProject these figures onto Gamestop as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it\u2019s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it\u2019s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it\u2019s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years\u2026 Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you\u2019re wondering how that\u2019s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another\u2026\n\nI have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).\n\nHere is a teaser\u2026 When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it\u2019s price north of $31,800 on it\u2019s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).\n\nIf you needed one more reason to HODL, it\u2019s this\u2026 you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife\u2019s boyfriend lost your password couldn\u2019t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects\u2026 I think I figured it out\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28tift4lreq61.png?width=1303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105caf042c76cb6607783b29773e179b2bd1aa45\n\nPlease Be Good To Each Other Out There.\n\nBehind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories. If you need one more reason to HODL -- I have (had) a terminally ill child (no I do not want anything from any of you) that has a life expectancy of 25ish (she's 9). She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it (nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant-toddler), which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make-A-Wish (the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for). I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life. From volunteers who attended the event (400+ costumed members) to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan (they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back). Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story. Why do I bring this up? I want to give my daughter the ability to live out her retirement when she's 18. Travel the world. Experience as much as she can. **If you need one more reason to HODL GME... I'm not selling until I can give her that.**\n\nDon\u2019t lose who you are in the wealth that may (or maybe not) suddenly fall into your lap based on your investing performances. I see mostly fucking amazing souls in this crowd of Apes. Let\u2019s make the world a better place.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nI don\u2019t know how the stock market works.\n\nI don\u2019t know how companies or their fundamentals work.\n\n**I bashed the keyboard a bunch of times and this popped out.**\n\nThe only thing I know for certain, is I bake a mean crayon pie.\n\nTrying to make Hot Pink a thing in our charting.\n\nWe need more colors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers.

        "selftext": "Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to \"re-opening\" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:\n\nIf a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.\n\nContrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. \n\nThink of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.\n\nConversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?\n\nThe point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. \n\nMy two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft \"growth\" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. \n\nKohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.\n\nBuy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.",

        "selftext": "Let\u2019s get the elephant in Spotify\u2019s room out of the way first, namely Apple Music. While Apple is a formidable competitor, they\u2019re second in the race by a large margin: Spotify sits at 144M subscribers and Apple sits around 60M (likely closer to 70M by now). Despite the services being available in roughly the same number of countries (APM:167, Spotify:170), **Spotify\u2019s been able to capture much more subscriber growth thanks to a few aggressive expansions.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou\u2019ve definitely heard of Spotify\u2019s aggressive podcast expansions, including JRE exclusivity and new originals/exclusives such as Michelle Obama\u2019s podcast. This expansion led Spotify to **surpass Apple\u2019s podcast numbers just barely in 2020, with analysts expecting 41% growth in 2021**. Analysts expect that 53.9% of \u2018digital audio listeners\u2019 will be podcast listeners in 2021. Spotify\u2019s continuing to expand in this space to meet upstart competitor Clubhouse, by testing paid podcast subscriptions that allow for interactivity. (side note, I\u2019d be interested to know if they\u2019re trying to compete with twitch here too)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA newer expansion on Spotify\u2019s part is their recent foray into audiobooks. It appears that they\u2019re sticking to public domain works for now to test the waters, but moving forwards, this could create a real challenge to competitors like Audible, a company with an estimated $2.5B in revenue in 2020 and no real competitors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify\u2019s been aggressively pursuing developing markets**, which has a negative impact on financials in the short term but could lead to greater profitability in the future.  The reason is that they charge lower rates in developing markets in order to build a subscriber base and a presence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto some quick financial stats. (figures in EUR) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify\u2019s 2020 revenue clocks in at 7.3B, and a 47.7B mkt cap, which works out to a P/S ratio of 6.53.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I like to value companies in the context of competitors \u2026 which is sort of hard to do for spotify. I\u2019d argue Netflix is the most comparable (software, digital media, subscriber model), and their P/S ratio sits at 8.96. Twitter\u2019s a bit of a stretch, but their P/S ratio sits at 13.5: Adobe, another stretch but closer imo as it\u2019s subscription-based software, sits at 15.9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify\u2019s debt/equity ratio is on a downward trend, sitting at 1.26. It\u2019s got a forwards CAGR of 22%.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest red flag I see on their balance sheet has to do with their **cost of revenue: it\u2019s been increasing almost in lock-step with revenue. Spotify\u2019s very close to being profitable, and they\u2019ve posted a profit for some quarters (though never a full year).** Spotify\u2019s under good management, however, and I\u2019m confident that once their more aggressive expansions mature, profit will follow, especially as they\u2019ve proved they can stave off competitors like Apple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a valuation play alone, I\u2019d argue Spotify is better suited to a **P/S of at least NFLX,** which would place it at **$375/sh**. With growth taken into account -- that the firm is estimated to grow at 22%, and is well-positioned globally against competitors -- I\u2019d argue a more accurate P/S would place it **closer to 10 P/S**, putting SPOT at **$418/sh**. ^((these P/S ratios are gargantuan, but that\u2019s true for the tech sector in general; my argument is that spotify\u2019s undervalued in the context of the current market.))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t really do deep dives into companies this much, so let me know where I might\u2019ve gone wrong in analyzing the company (especially if I missed something in the balance sheet).",

        "selftext": "Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.\n\nThe Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told \"the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.\"\n\nToyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.\n\nWhen the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla \"will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.\n\nI think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What's in it for Toyota?**\n\nToyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM\u2013Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.\u201d Although the context is not clear, it was also written \u201cprobably within a few months,\u201d an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.\n\n[Source](https://www.torquenews.com/1/tesla-and-toyota-are-considering-jointly-developing-small-electric-suv-platform)",

Wedbush sees it as a perfect opportunity to scoop up the group's biggest name.\n\nInvestors gearing up for a swift economic rebound have recently dumped growth stocks for riskier plays. The broad rotation to value stocks has dragged on tech mega-caps and sparked wild shifts between heavy selling and sudden dip-buying. While the Nasdaq composite notched a massive 3.7% gain on Tuesday, the biggest tech stocks still boast year-to-date losses.\n\nThe weakness sets up a \"great entry point\" for investors interested in [**Apple**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest), Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note. The firm added Apple to its \"best ideas\" list on Wednesday, praising the company's blowout December-quarter results and growth in Asia. After exceeding expectations for iPhone 12 sales, the iPhone 13 could be a \"game-changer\" that extends the upgrade \"supercycle\" for another year, Ives said.\n\n\"The recent sell-off creates a golden buying opportunity with a $3 trillion valuation on the horizon for Cupertino in our opinion,\" he added.\n\nWedbush reiterated its \"outperform\" rating with a $175 price target. The firm also holds a bull-case target of $225, which implies an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing level.\n\nWall Street expects Apple to ship roughly 220 million iPhones in the current fiscal year. Ives holds a considerably rosier outlook, instead projecting sales can rise to a record 250 million.\n\nThe bullish estimate is partially fueled by expectations for millions of current iPhone owners to upgrade their phones throughout the year. Some 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are due for an upgrade, according to Wedbush. The dynamic stands to prop up demand into the fall, Ives said.\n\nThe upgrade supercycle could even last through 2022 if iPhone 13 rumors prove true, the analyst added. Supply chain reports signal Apple initially aims to build 100 million units of the upcoming model, up from 80 million for the iPhone 12 lineup.\n\nWhile this number is subject to change, the reports hint at \"an increased confidence with Cook &amp; Co. that this 5G product cycle\" will continue into next year, Ives said.\n\nApple closed at $121.08 on Tuesday, down 9.4% year-to-date. The company has 81 \"buy\" ratings, 15 \"hold\" ratings, and three \"sell\" ratings from analysts.",

I know, I know, I didn't think my first contribution would be about a Jim Cramer Boomer Stock... but yea, it really is. But just follow along with me here.\n\nI first began the day planning out my next moves for when I start jumping off the tech train (like right about now), and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retail/life (and once the CPI begins to bump, the moves for making money in the market during inflation). This led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities.\n\n**ENTER COSTCO**\n\nI then pull up COST and wonder what the heck am I looking at.

No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6jtyoyferk61.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d06efbe13966d7ee2d559e5a7c4fd0d7f6a106\n\nWas there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.\n\nThen I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things\n\n**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**\n\nhttps://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html\n\nWell, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.\n\nhttps://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html\n\nHere's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18\n\nAs you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.\n\nSo I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3\n\nEach blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztl2qhukerk61.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a\n\nAs you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?\n\n**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**\n\nLooking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.\n\n&gt;This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.\n\nhttps://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html\n\nAnd looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.\n\nhttps://www dot marketbeat dot com/stocks/NASDAQ/COST/earnings/\n\nThe most recent price target estimate I could easily google (ALL above where its trading now)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4obvitmerk61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5196871a95da03e36cea4ad3f807545f3397fb50\n\n**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**\n\n**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**\n\n&gt;In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3\ufeff The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4\ufeff  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.\n\n**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**\n\nContinuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.\n\n**They are international (also making tendies):**\n\n&gt;Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.\n\nhttps://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774\n\n**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**\n\n&gt;Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.\n\nhttps://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx\n\nCostco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?) Calls. Ill have 60 shares come market open tomorrow.\n\nedit: fat fingered march 5th instead of march 4th earnings call.\n\nedit 2: i wrote horizontal line instead of vertical line when referencing the plotted earnings calls (too much writing!).",

        "selftext": "Hi fellow WSB,\n\n$GM has some real potential to bring me some generational wealth. $500 PT. Yes, you heard that right. \n\n1.\tGM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles. \n\n2.\tGM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.\n\n3.\tGM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.\n\n4.\tGM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.\n\n5.\tGM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge! \n\n6.\tApple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.\n\n7.\tFamous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.\n\n8.\tPresident Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.\n\n9.\tChip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.\n\n10.\tNewly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).\n\nMegabullish on this to double or triple once the media/ mainstream investors discover what $GM can really do! Position below. Cheers guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw0hi639kqk61.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=220549adeb676f1397f61406fd6566b7720cffcd",

        "selftext": "I posted this in r/CCIV but Ill share here also \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarlier today I posted my Lucid YOLO options purchase here.... \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/m26uib/lucid\\_cciv\\_yolo\\_part\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/m26uib/lucid_cciv_yolo_part_1/)\n\nthe entry point seems to be ok, we have found a rounded bottom on the 5 day chart and looking to move about the $25 mark as we get closer to merger and use that as a floor. I sold my warrants and rolled into leap options, with extremely small common position. I can then add to the dip if we retest $21.50 easily, won't get called on warrants, and having the majority of capital in options that will keep me personally from over trading.\n\nSo I thought I would post up my DD and thesis why I think this is a great value investment that has a lot of potential. Here we go.... TLDR at the end\n\n**CCIV / Lucid Motors**\n\n**Background**\n\nFirst and foremost I am not a professional trader nor am I a financial advisor. I do however have A LOT of experience in the automotive field, in particular BMW. I have been trained, and worked on pretty much all BMW electric or hybrid models with the exception of the last 3 current model years or so. I have met with BMWs engineers over the years (foreign and domestic), toured factories and of course owned and/or driven almost every BMW model ever made. Also managed one of the largest BMW Service departments and loaner car fleets in the USA. I know.....what the fuck does this have to do with LUCID. The old saying.....I might know a thing or two, because I\u2019ve seen a thing or two. Im also no longer working in the car business but that's for another day.\n\n**Lucid Motors leadership:**\n\nYou can find the list of executive management here: [Board of Directors | Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/board/)\n\nPeter Rawlinson \u2013 CEO/CTO As you know he\u2019s a former Tesla, has over 30 years of automotive experience, including leading the model S team at Tesla. Extensive engineering background with multiple automotive companies. Although I love Peters proper CEO leadership and great speaking ability, I do not believe in the future he will be still be leading both roles of CTO and CEO. There is room to grow on this board and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone left the Silicon Valley to join Lucid (as Peter has already encouraged a partnership with a large cap tech company).\n\nShelby Chen \u2013 Hes got M&amp;A experience mainly in China with Tsing Capital. There is not a lot of info around on him, but he could be the key to Asia markets based on his experience when the brands wants to grow into again markets.\n\nTurqi Alnowaiser \u2013 Representing the PIF, that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nTony Posawatz \u2013 Non Executive Director \u2013 40 years of auto experience, lead the turnaround and resale of Fisker Automotive (Polished the turd and sold it in a year). Hes pretty active on twiiter [u/TonyPosawatz](https://www.reddit.com/u/TonyPosawatz/)\n\nAndrew Liveris \u2013 You already know the Michael Klein connection to Churchill Capital, the relationship has proved its purpose.\n\nOnce the merger is completed I do expect Lucid to add to its board, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Alan Mulally joined based him being on the Churchill board, or he might make an excellent recommendation for them.\n\n**Technology**\n\nOne thing that sets Lucid apart from other competitors is their technology. Everything is in house! Battery design, electric motors are all designed and manufactured in house. They do not rely on someone else to make powertrains or batteries somewhere else and ship them. Why is this sooooooooooo important? Well let me tell you\u2026. When you don\u2019t engineer and manufacture your own shit you leave exponential risk to supply chains and potential defects. Ill use BMW as an example\u2026 The N54 engine was to be the first twin turbo motor produced in the brand and the first with a gasoline high pressure fuel system that ran as pressure of 300 bar. This fuel system was designed and supplied by another manufacturer. When troubles arose, vehicles were repurchased, the company got sued, bad headlines for the brand and dealers suffered. When you are the designer and manufacturer you are always 100% in the know and are not being sold on the NEXT BIG THING trying to chase automotive awards or competition. The next thing that goes seriously undervalued in this company is their experience in racing\u2026.. Im sure most of you are thinking why does that apply? Well my favorite engineering term that\u2019s always often used to describe new parts is \u201cROBUST\u201d. When you test parts like batteries from constant abuse (Formula E) you tend to learn a thing or two pretty quick what works and what doesn\u2019t. Lucid\u2019s experience in being the battery supplier for Formula E has have them not only an edge in efficiency, but I am willing to be a more ROBUST battery than other EVs. By manufacturing their own battery you have now entered into a technology race with TESLA which for the moment, Lucid appears to be winning.\n\n[2021 Lucid Air: Digging Into the Luxury EV's Tesla-Beating Tech (motortrend.com)](https://www.motortrend.com/news/2021-lucid-air-technology/) You can read some supporting information here.\n\n[Atieva Powers Season 6 of Formula E with Spec Battery Pack of Its Own Design | Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/atieva-powers-season-6-formula-e-spec-battery-pack-its-own-design/)\n\n**Models**\n\nThe Lucid Air being available in 5 different model variants from $69,900 to $161,500 make the car more available to luxury buyers more than just BALLERS. The SUV market is HUGE in the US and also the most competitive. By leading the technology race Project Gravity will sure to be a hit in 2023. If you are unsure why the SUV should be the next model, ask Lamborghini how many of the Urus they sold last year (4,391 Urus produced to 3039 of combined other Lambo models in 2020). Peter specifically said a high production, low priced vehicle will be the last item on the list to produce, and he's right. There is no point to rush into a high produced, low margin vehicle right away, that's for last (Tesla model 3 playbook).\n\n**Production**\n\nThe first phase of the factory (999,000sqft) \u00a0has been completed which took about a year to complete and production of the Lucid Air will be rolling off early summer 2021.\n\nYou can see some of it here [Inside Lucid Motors\u2019 new electric vehicle factory in Casa Grande, Arizona - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy6Lcz7CsQY) .\n\nPhase 2 of 5 has already been approved by Arizona and will begin construction immediately for Project Gravity. The total size of the factory will reach 5.1 Million sqft once all phases are completed. Phase 2 should be complete roughly Feb 2022, which will be the perfect ramp for Gravity in 2023 MY.\n\nWhat is not so talked about is the battery and powertrain factory is at another offsite facility in Arizona. This is a smart move allowing Lucid to scale the business from the automotive side and from the industrial side simultaneously without slowing either business.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Diverse Portfolio**\n\nLucid is also following the footsteps of Tesla and allowing their battery design to be used for non-automotive power supply\n\n[Electric-Car Startup Lucid to Follow Tesla Into Energy Storage - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-09/electric-car-startup-lucid-to-follow-tesla-into-energy-storage)\n\nWhy is this important? Well when you become the leader in the technology race of EVs you can become a supplier to other OEMs and apply your patents to a broader space of other industries. This allows you to have a higher space of growth or \u201cblue ocean strategy\u201d.\n\nPowertrain and battery factory is separate from the auto manufacturing location so both sides of the business can grow without stepping on each other.\n\n**Competitive Advantage of Lucid Air Model**\n\n1. Battery design \u2013 not only is the battery range longer (over 500 miles), its smaller and more light weight then its competitors ( 3-5 year technology advantage in my view)\n2. Motor design \u2013 Much smaller with less moving parts than competitors (3-5 year technology advantage in my view)\n3. Model advantage to Tesla Model S Plaid \u2013 When the Plaid becomes available the specifications are going to be pretty close in performance. I would give the Lucid the advantage in luxury especially with the back seat design. The model S will have a slight autonomous driving advantage.\n4. 900V proven platform with the most range available in any electric vehicle at the moment.\n5. The ability to use your vehicle as a power supply for your home without having to buy a Tesla Power Wall or other battery supply system (10-20K cost advantage).\n6. Charging ability via Wunderbox \u2013 Fastest charging available to date.\n7. The vehicle is built for tomorrow, not just for today.\n\n**Electrify America Partnership**\n\nI wont be the first to tell you that Lucid is not going to be rolling out its own charging stations and it DOESN\u2019T MATTER!!!!!! Now, let me explain. When TESLA launched to Model S the biggest consumer backlash was over range. I will tell you that this is the BIGGEST pushback on all EVs. TESLA burned CASH to build out a charging infrastructure to support their own vehicles (own chargers and their own proprietary charging connector). The reason for this was they were the only manufacturer trying to build the consumer case for EVs. There was no other true competitor, thus the reason they needed to have a charging infrastructure to support the product. EVs have now surpassed the need to OEMs to be the sole source of charging. This would be like FORD having to supply all the gas stations, it just doesn\u2019t make sense and its not a good use of capital.\n\nThere are several charging companies out there now, some established and some starting. The car of any brand can only charge at the level of what the power is available, and what the car can accept. The fastest way to charge cars with a large battery capacity is with a DC power supply (Level 3 Charger). The charging speed dictation will be with the available power and the cars capability. The Lucid battery has the capacity to charge faster than any other OEM at the moment.\n\n[Lucid Air to be the Fastest Charging EV, Featuring a 900V+ Architecture Delivering a Charging Rate of Up to 20 Miles Per Minute | Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-air-fastest-charging-ev/#:~:text=The%20Lucid%20Air%20will%20be%20a%20groundbreaking%20EV%20in%20terms,to%2080%20miles%20per%20hour)\n\nThere will not be enough DC chargers to put out the speed today that Lucid can accept. This is a good thing, you are not buying a 10 year old out dated laptop that only accepts floppy discs. The car is BUILT for the FUTURE. As EVs grow, charging station companies will be expanding their fleets and the power available for charging at fast rates will grow.\n\nLast, with a 500 plus mile range you wont need to charge this thing everyday. Tell me how many times the average driver leaves home, drives over 500 miles before returning home? The answer, very few time a year which is why the growth of home charging networks will also grow. How many cars have 500 mile range gas tanks? Pretty few with the exception of some big diesel trucks. You don\u2019t need to keep making the battery bigger, after all it\u2019s the most costly expense. 500 miles of driving range will calm the nerves of almost all previous anxious EV drivers.\n\n**Autonomous Driving**\n\nThis is the largest and also smallest hurdle for Lucid. Here is the current autonomous levels for reference.\n\n[The 6 Levels of Vehicle Autonomy Explained | Synopsys Automotive](https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html)\n\nAlmost all manufacturers can get to level 2 right now with a simple camera and lidar system. Tesla has released its beta autopilot and its basically close to level 3, more like 2.75. Lucid has developed the car again for the future with a combination of 32 sensors and cameras.\n\n[Lucid Motors Announces Lucid DreamDrive, an Advanced Driver-Assistance System that Debuts in the Lucid Air | Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-announces-lucid-dreamdrive/)\n\nHow important is autonomous driving to customers? I will use the Tesla Model Y (which I own) for reference. The model Y like the Lucid Air comes will all the hardwire required for autonomous driving. The model Y comes with a basic version of Level 2 autonomous driving, if you want to upgrade to the FULL autopilot which is basically level 2.75 its an extra $10,000. **Tesla only sells about 15% of all capable models with full autopilot.** Now at least Tesla will sell it to you\u2026 other manufactures like Cadillac are discussing 2-3 years for free and then you pay a subscription beyond that. This is A LOT of LIABILITY to take on as a manufacture to sell AUTO PILOT as a permanent feature. You are basically on the LIABILITY hook with NHTSA for life by offering this feature including any potential recalls. With only 15% of drivers willing to pay for it now, this feature is not the make or break for the company, electric range will be. I believe long term, ALL manufactures will offer autonomous driving as a subscription model. Another great example, Microsoft Office is now Microsoft 360, yearly subscription revenue. Easy way for public companies can show steady \"SERVICE\" revenues without product sales. Who says they can't license it from another company if for some reason theirs is not as good? Less risk also.....\n\n**History of EV success and failures**\n\nTESLA is successful, we have covered most of the reasons why already and Peter has experience with those. **WHY** people choose Teslas over other EVs? First reason is technology (we have outlined those). Second, non-polarizing looks. How many EVs have you seen where you looked at one and couldn\u2019t tell if it was gas or electric? Almost all EVs have some type of lame wannabe futuristic design that people don\u2019t necessarily care for. Now up and til the debut of the Cyber Truck, most Tesla Models were not polarizing to consumers. I think the consensus of the Cyber truck is about 50% love, 50% hate. Tesla makes a descent looking car, but really has the technology people want and enjoy.\n\nOther failures\u2026. I can start by generalizing the majority of existing OEMs by saying they outsource their electrical powertrain technology and you will find that they are all about 5 years behind and 150 miles short in driving range. There are several examples but the most recent one I was excited for what the Porsche Taycan Turbo S. The prototype was sick AF with suicide doors, fast and a 800V battery and promised driving range just over 300 miles. Well, what did we get? $185,000 gets you 192 mile driving range, and a basic Porsche interior. This is the typical OEM response to chasing Tesla. I expect more of this with the new BMW I4 (its gonna be ugly), Jaguar I-Pace and the hideous Mercedes concept.\n\nIMO other EV startups that may not make it:\n\n1. Polestar \u2013 the 200 mile swiss electric volvo. Seen 2 in person, not terrible design but lack EV technology.\n2. Fisker \u2013 The abortion of Henrik Fisker (BMW designer of the 6 series and Z8) from 2008, used outsourced A123 battery supplier which went BK (car was shit anyways, plagued with electrical issues from body harness design amongst other things (my friends worked there), sold to Chinese auto parts company. Henrik retained the name and trademark to try and relaunch it. They wont produce their first SUV until 2022, which will be at an outsourced manufacturing facility in Austria (again same narrative as previous company history, and it will probly repeat itself.) Id stay the FUCK AWAY from this one.\n3. Rivian \u2013 Its got a chance, huge backing from Ford (again chasing), Amazon (why not) debuts in June 2021, but the large truck and large SUV design is not really a competitor with Lucid.\n4. Karma \u2013 See Fisker, it was the Chinese abortion and the 20 year old laptop someone thinks might work.\n5. Faraday Future -\u00a0 feel free to read the wiki, but they have poor leadership, lackluster product and cannot manage money. STAY AWAY!!!!! [Faraday Future - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_Future)\n6. Nikola \u2013 you already have heard, cant trust em, nothing proven, GM already wasted money on a pipe dream, and they aint got a working model.\n7. Lordstown \u2013 More of a competitor to Rivian and Nikola, but again 250 mile range, lacks technology, not a direct competitor.\n\nHybrids\u2026 more trouble than they are worth. Many oems have come out with hybrid cars to get the range out of cars and too be honest they don\u2019t work that well. There is too many parts, a lot of engineering to get both systems to work well together flawlessly. You still have to meet combustion engine emissions requirements. Greatest flop\u2026.. BMW I8. Super hyped, descent looking, what did we get? A 3 cylinder turbo motor on one axle, and really small battery with 13 mile range on the other and a ton of carbon fiber. The car was super expensive to make, weak performance and dealers still have trouble selling them. In fact you can pick one up used for as little as 60K.\n\nALL ELECTRIC WORKS! There\u2019s is library\u2019s full of stories why EVs work, but heres the reason TESLA and LUCID will continue to work.\n\n1. Simple standard aluminum chassis, cheaper and less expensive than carbon fiber but not has heavy as steel.\n2. Basic cost effective design, and not POLARIZING!\n3. Technological advantage over competitors, without a doubt 3-5 years ahead.\n4. Room for technology advances without the need to upgrade hardware in the vehicle (autonomous driving upgrades in the future)(Fast charging)\n5. Luxury braded EV\n6. Vehicle engineering, design and production is vertically integrated (no outsourcing)\n7. Proven tested technology\n8. No internal combustion engine, no smog requirements, which also means less governance. \n\nNow why TESLA and LUCID will continue to achieve... These brands complement each other, one is more value branded and the other luxury branded. Its like Toyota and Lexus, but different parent companies with similar technologies. They are both vertically integrated from design, production and retail distribution (they CONTROL the NARRATIVE).\n\n**Marketing**\n\nLucid is running the same playbook as Tesla, stores in the mall and eliminating the franchise agreement. Ive been to the one in west LA (next to Beverly Hills), its literally right by Apple and Tesla. It works well!!! Keep running with it... run the play til it stops working. \n\n**Launch**\n\nWell Elon said it himself, prototypes are easy, production is hard. Thats why Im ok with rolling back the initial delivery a month or two. Its better to work hard to keep the quality high and under promise and over deliver. Once the the Air Model is out, the roll out of the Gravity should be much easier. They don't use the same production line which means there is no retooling to do between runs (TESLA had this problem).\n\n**Possible OBSTACLES**\n\n1. Production, will be the hardest part no matter what.\n2. PIF intervention and influence of next factory placement. (Control can be eliminated with board member voting rights)\n3. Saudi violations of human rights intervention from US (appears to be low risk based off latest journalist incident)\n4. Initial delivery issues\n\n**Potential GREEN SHOOTS**\n\n1. Great new board members (there's room for a good CTO)\n2. Lucid Air well received at launch by customers\n3. High gasolines prices drive EV sales (See recent mentions of comedy super cycle with inflation, it appears to be happening.)\n4. Government incentives to switch to EV increased or extended\n5. Partnership with Large Cap tech company for vehicle integrations (apple?)\n\n**Value Investment Proposition**\n\n1. You are getting a Tesla like product, without having to convince customers the first real EV proposition and without having to build a charging infrastructure.\n2. This is now going to be a CASH rich company that can get them to 2023 without debt since they over subscribed the PIPE invest with an extra 1.5 Billion (Churchill says sorry) in a economic environment in which interest rates will be rising putting pressure on other high growth/high levered competitors.\n3. SPACs in the last 2 weeks have come under scrutiny and you now have an entry point much lower than the DA with plenty of room to run.\n4. We have a cordial, well spoken CEO who you don't have to worry about being removed as CEO by the board for something he said on twitter.\n\n**Price Point**\n\nTesla burned a fucking wad of cash the first 5 years and raised money with stock multiple times. There will be cash burn from Lucid, but I don't think it will be the levels of Tesla. I think they get to 2023 without having to raise some cash via stock offering. They will need this for the final factory expansion.\n\nI think Lucid can ramp up faster than Tesla because they have the cash and can operate freely, they have secured facilities and a road map to success already. They will have less road blocks since Tesla has paved the way for direct sales to consumers, charging network and proven concept.\n\nHeres a 3rd party article that argues some valuation with a somewhat bearish view so I'm not hyping anything\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/10/how-lucid-motors-stock-could-double-your-money/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/10/how-lucid-motors-stock-could-double-your-money/)\n\nNow it states that a valuation of 64B at $40 a share is lofty and I do agree for today. Remember, stocks trade based on forward earnings and sales, and lets not forget Teslas sales were weak and the product was out of favor until recently. Since then the growth of Tesla has been exponential. We have the country pushing for EVs and consumers will drive them. I mean a fucking sedan doing a 9.9 1/4 mile time with a 500 mile driving range. I mean that's like a Ferrari assassin sleeper shit, and this is a REALITY.\n\nMerger Complete Price Point: **June 30, 2021 - $30**\n\nVehicle deliveries have been rolling at 75% of expectations **EOY December 2021 - $40**\n\nLucid Air production is ramped up and bugs are worked out for 2022, Gravity debut and second facility completed for Gravity production **March 2022 $75**\n\nGravity production running 100%, Air 100% **December 2022 $100**\n\nOther Exponential factors in Lucid valuation that have not been factored into sales +/- 20%\n\n1. Battery and Powertrain units being sold to other manufactures\n2. Cash raise at the end of 2022 to fund future production facilities\n3. Licensing of proprietary technology to other OEMs\n4. Expansion of powertrain and battery factory\n5. A world of unfucking knowns\n6. Tease of other models or new concepts (Coupe sports car would be my next limited production high profitable model choice). \n\n**TLDR**\n\n**I like the stock**",

Just shy of $18 TRILLION rough numbers. Then remember, *there's international markets*. [This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. \"China\u2019s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth\u201481 percent said they trade at least once a month\" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)\n\n*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:\n\nA graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)\n\nThe above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. &amp; if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|5|730k shares|\n|1|10|1.46m shares|\n|5|5|3.65m shares|\n|5|10|7.3m shares|\n|10|5|7.3m shares|\n|10|10|14.6m shares|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.\n\n\"The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.nasdaq.com\\/articles\\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https://preview.redd.it/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)\n\nIt appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*\n\nSo why does retail \"not control the market\" ?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.\n\n1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.\n2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for \"power\" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.\n\nI know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.",

        "selftext": "Eric J. Savitz\u2022\ud83d\udcf7Last Updated March 8, 2021, 11:06 AM\n\nOver time, Apple has been a pioneer in the way humans work with computers. Although it isn't always at the head of the innovation curve, no company has had a more dramatic impact on the way humans and machines interact.\n\nAs TFI Asset Management analyst Ming-Chi Kuo pointed out in a research note released over the weekend, Apple popularized the mouse and graphical user interface for computers, the iPod click wheel, and multi-touch functionality for the iPhone and iPad. And he says Apple can lead the way in the next leap in computing interfaces: mixed and augmented reality.\n\n\"We believe that MR/AR will be the next critical technology to define the innovative human-machine interface for electronic products,\" Kuo wrote in the note. \"We believe that MR/AR will provide innovative visual experiences and redefine human behavior in creating, processing, and receiving information, which is why Apple is highly committed to MR/AR. One of Apple's advantages is defining the innovative human-machine interface, so we are taking a positive view of Apple's future in MR/AR.\"\n\nKuo argued that in the long run, MR/AR interfaces will replace all display-equipped electronic products. Apple's strategy will unfold in three stages, he predicted.\n\nHe expects Apple to launch a helmet for virtual and augmented reality experiences by mid-2022. Kuo says the helmet will be equipped with Sony-built Micro-OLED displays and various optical modules to provide a \"video see-through AR experience,\" but with the ability to offer virtual-reality experiences as well.\n\nHe thinks the price tag of the helmet will be similar to that of high-end iPhones, at about $1,000. Kuo expects the contract manufacturer Pegatron to produce the helmets.\n\n\"Although Apple has been focusing on AR, we think the hardware specifications of this product can provide an immersive experience that is significantly better than existing VR products,\" he wrote. \"We believe that Apple may highly integrate this helmet with video-related applications (like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, etc.) as one of the key selling points.\"\n\nKuo said Apple's second product in this category will be MR/AR glasses. He doesn't think Apple has an existing prototype, and wrote that the glasses won't reach the market before 2025, at the earliest. Kuo thinks the glasses will be more specifically intended for augmented reality applications. \"We are looking forward to seeing the integration of glasses and Apple Car to provide an innovative user experience,\" he said.\n\nEven farther out, in 2030 or later, he expects Apple to offer a contact-lens product with MR/AR capabilities. \"This product will bring electronics from the era of \"visible computing\" to \"invisible computing, \" he said.\n\nApple as a matter of policy doesn't discuss unannounced products, and hasn't addressed any of these potential devices. The stock was down 1.9%, to $119.18 on Monday morning.\n\nWrite to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com\n\n\u00a9 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.",

        "selftext": "Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  \n\nSure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like \"Stimulus Checks set to arrive...\"\n\nBut *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including\u2014but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do\u2014if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.\n\n**This one couldn\u2019t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. \n\n**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). \n\n**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week\u2019s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn\u2019t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. \n\n**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low\u2014there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people\u2019s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.\n\nBut anyway, **you didn\u2019t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.\n\n***\n\n**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They\u2019re great!**\n\n**Last week\u2019s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.\n\n**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though \ud83d\ude05 \n\n**Last week\u2019s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it\u2019s okay to take a pause on the pick if it\u2019s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**\n\n**\u201dNever lost, just ran out of time\u201d**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.\n\n***\n\n**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*\n\n[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))\n\nWhen I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.\n[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  \n\nI just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.\n\n[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/19](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))\n\n**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  \n\nSomeone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. \n\nSometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh \ud83d\ude2d ).\n\n[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.\n\n[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)\n\nThe intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I\u2019m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.\n\n***\n\n**Tier 2**: Watching with great interest\n\n[AAPL](https://i.imgur.com/C40J4QR.jpg): [Rumored product launch event on 3/23](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/apple-may-launch-airpods-3-ipad-pro-update-and-more-products-at-march-23-event-1777186-2021-03-09). Thanks /u/7thprincess \n\n[ABNB](https://i.imgur.com/XinYxt5.jpg): No rambo, but look at this crazy ass whale bet that came through with hilarious VOL/OI.

        "selftext": "**How to play FOMC this week**\n\nHaven\u2019t really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn\u2019t repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. More than likely, we will hear the policy changes, or the lack thereof, on the 17th. I've did a quick browse and saw a few things explaining FOMC/YCC/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*\n\n**I\u2019ve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don\u2019t want to read this, I\u2019ll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**\n\nMy final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*\n\nIf you haven\u2019t kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I\u2019ll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don\u2019t throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There\u2019s a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.\n\n**Types of Bubbles:**\n\n**Commodities** \n\nMoon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won\u2019t see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. \nThe Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We\u2019ve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.\n\n**Housing bubble**\n\nResidential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH/Stimmys/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn\u2019t a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won\u2019t let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.\n\n**Stock market** \n\nVery clear and everybody knows it, but it\u2019s not about if, it\u2019s about when. Unlikely they\u2019ll let it fail right now. Most likely won\u2019t crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.\n\n**Credit Bubble** \n\nQE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won\u2019t let this fall because it\u2019ll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.\n\n**Economic bubble**\n\nRelated to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won\u2019t let this pop right now because we\u2019re finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.\n\n\nSo as you can see, we\u2019re in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.\n\n\n**Things to watch at FOMC:**\n\n**Yield Curve Control**\n\nIncreases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We\u2019re already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.\n\n**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** \n\nWhen covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don\u2019t worry it doesn\u2019t matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. \n\nRecently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can\u2019t afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.\n\nRather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there\u2019s inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.\n\n**4 scenarios and how to play them:**\n\n**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**\n\nPlay REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I\u2019d be cautious tho. Because there\u2019s a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.\n\n**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**\n\nYields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we\u2019re in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I\u2019d play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I\u2019d begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I\u2019d start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.\n\n**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**\n\nHold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I\u2019ve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I\u2019m talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.\n\n**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**\n\nMassive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don\u2019t buy precious metals, because they\u2019re not based off anything anymore. And they\u2019re heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It\u2019s currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.\n\nI personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it\u2019ll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you\u2019ve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.\n\nIn short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it\u2019s harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don\u2019t inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren\u2019t included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.\n\nHopefully this helps y\u2019all. There\u2019s money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can\u2019t find it, keep looking. If there\u2019s an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.\n\nAMC/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nYCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)\n\nYCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities \n\nYCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber/sugar/coffee/copper)\n\nYCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)\n\nIf you want to make big money fast, print/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we\u2019ll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it\u2019ll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.\n\nOne ^more thing^:\n\nThere is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.\n\nIf I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*\n\nAnd last but not least, the obligatory:\n\n*Sir this is a Wendy's.*",

        "selftext": "Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.\n*****\n&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; \u201cThe markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,\u201d said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cI think the message is going to be consistent.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.\n*****\n&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% \u2014 its highest level in more than a year.\n*****\n&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year \u2014 deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,\u201d said Peters of PGIM.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there\u2019s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.\n*****\n&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals\n&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.\n*****\n&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen rates are very low, valuations don\u2019t matter to people,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf rates are low, there\u2019s no penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he\u2019s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe names that I\u2019m in \u2014 Visa, GM, Ford, Macy\u2019s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,\u201d Redler said. \u201cLast week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, \u2018Was that it?\u2019\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,\u201d he said. \u201cRates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday\u2019s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Apple\u2019s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether.

In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank\u2019s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.\n*****\n&gt; The program expires March 31.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,\u201d Peters of PGIM said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe markets are kind of divided on what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path.

This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.\n\n&gt; March\u2019s option expiration week performance is second only to December\u2019s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ\u2019s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March\u2019s quarterly options expiration.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ef1d4cbdd86a8efa09b8c2942d48517/32ed3896b2fe9623-1a/s500x750/f4254e1e0edf858dbfd4e67344757c69c48d30b6.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81d51a4dd39b5941b831de20b28314c7/32ed3896b2fe9623-0e/s500x750/3ef3515466260a5660a9ec6eadb8a91cd697cf96.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/92b861530dfd9673b236fb0cd7af89c0/32ed3896b2fe9623-3c/s500x750/23c07978c0f660d7070cc8e2dd6c81aa392a92b7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?\n\n&gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.\n\n&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While we don\u2019t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. \u201cWe remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\n&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market\u2019s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior \u2013 and likely to do so for some time to come.\n\n&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.\n\n&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today\u2019s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week\u2019s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.\n\n&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.\n\n&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/264401d95b5a55c592a6f8f10df22c5e/24ec511e4e033f88-38/s500x750/fe7be5042338b6e7e7b428a0f8fd5208691e48d7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Versatile Outperformers\n\n&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308a-768x515.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308b-768x509.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308c-768x253.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfVfqx2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k2c0t0O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/VKvrx46.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  3.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eoFBwOW.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ujRMr7q.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/myM4TrG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jVQLr1k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AWKlUdJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWuSo8l.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VyDOWFI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $270.20\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "Reports of the [semiconductor shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage) in early February had me take deeper look into the industry. Wanted to share my thoughts with the sub!\n\nThe market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. \n\nThere are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.\n\nThe producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. \n\nBetween Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. \n\nThat said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price. \n\nTLDR: We need more chips. TSM makes the best chips.",

        "selftext": "**Roblox IPO ($RBLX) Analysis:**\n\n*I am no expert on video games or Roblox, but after some research and digging these are my thoughts on this hyped up IPO launching tomorrow.* \n\n**Intro:**\n\n***Roblox*** is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation. It allows users to [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) games and play games created by other users. Founded by [David Baszucki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Baszucki) and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)).\n\n*Roblox* is free-to-play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called \"Robux\". As of August 2020, *Roblox* had over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by over half of all children aged under 16 in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).\n\n**Key Points:** \n\n* Valuation raised from $4B to $29.5B last February\n* Anyone can be a content developer and sell their content for in game currency called Robux. Roblox takes a 30% cut of this. \n* In essence, Roblox is a platform for gaming creators to make content, similarly to YouTube or an Apple App Store\n* In July of 2020, Roblox expected to pay out $250M to its developers.\n* From 2019 to 2020 Roblox experienced a 68% Increase in revenue YoY.\n* Daily active users from 2019 to 2020 grew from 17.6M to 31.3M, 43.8%\n* $1.62M per Day Revenue (ARP)/ 31.3M Daily Active Users (DAU) = $0.05/user ARPDAU\n* Casual games on the App store have an average of $0.10 ARPDAU, so a Roblox $0.05 ARPDAU is rather low. \n* Majority of their users are not paying. \n* Net losses grew from $50M to $206M from 2019 to 2020, with an increase in spending in their infrastructure trust and safety, R&amp;D and general administration.\n* Free cash flow grew from $6M in 2019 to $292.6M in 2020. \n* Average user retention is 23 months in 2019 and 2020\n* Lock up period for Roblox is 180 days, which means that employees and insiders cannot sell their shares. \n\nOverall, I think that Roblox is a very popular gaming platform for young kids that has a good social aspect to it. They seem to have increased their spending in 'Trust and Safety' which is hugely important for younger aged gamers, no one wants a weirdo talking to their kids on Roblox. Roblox has a unique business model in the gaming industry that allows its users to create new content. As long as Roblox can continue to incentivize its creators, it should continue seeing a huge rate of growth. \n\nThe problems that I see is mainly the ARPDAU number. $0.05 ARPDAU seems to me to be pretty low compared to other popular gaming titles, however I am no expert. What that means to me is that the Roblox team is not monetizing the game very well. Hopefully, that changes and they can double or triple the ARPDAU. \n\nAnother issue I see is that the users have around a 23 month lifespan, so Roblox will continually need to refill their active user pool. From what I can see is 23 months is less than some other major gaming titles. Roblox is suited for kids under 13, and whether we like it or not, kids grow up fast and might find Roblox un-cool. \n\nRoblox doesn't make me all that excited to be honest, and I won't be investing much money into this company long term until I see an increase in the ARPDAU. However something important that isn't talked about enough is the  'Lockup' period. Investors and insiders can't dump their shares as soon as this IPOs so us, retail investors, should do OK buying it. Will I buy $RBLX tomorrow? Of course! Will I invest more than a few % of my portfolio? Absolutely not! This is to hyped for the numbers, in my opinion. When in the markets there is greed, be fearful. \n\nThe truth is, no one knows what will happen tomorrow with $RBLX, but it will be fun to trade nevertheless!",

Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS or Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). \n\nThose that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of \"polished premium-ness\" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). \n\nThe first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).\n\nIVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart.

Which is why retail weak fingers are getting walked down. (Regulation is the most feared btw.) If it wasnt for Clover health pulling some strings behind the scenes I dont think they would exist. Clov was caught running a red light, so take the fine, and get back in your Tesla. If not for fraud they wouldn't last a year.

        "selftext": "While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. \n\nConsider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \\~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\nNow, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. \n\nRemember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, \"Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower.\" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \\~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.\n\nTL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k.

My post isn't to pump the stock, I'd love for it to keep going lower so I can keep buying more LEAPS, but I'd love to hear some arguments as to why my thesis is wrong so I can have some differing viewpoints.\n\nBuying Sony today to me feels like buying Apple in 2013.  \"No revenue growth, one trick pony, no innovation, etc.\"  This is what they used to say about Apple in 2013.  I disagreed and plowed 80% of my net worth into Apple.  At the time, Apple was trading between 11-13 PE.  That seemed extremely cheap to me for a company that is part of a duopoly on a product that people are addicted to and will stare at for 8+ hours a day.  \n\nSony is currently trading near a 12-13 PE with close to 45b cash on hand and barely any debt. Ex cash they are trading under a 10 PE.  They haven't had much revenue growth the past years, but I expect that to change being at the beginning of a new console cycle. They are killing earnings and you can't even find the PS5 in store. They makes a device that people are addicted to. Like Apple, they get a 30% cut off the software that other people make to run on their device. They are part of a duopoly/triopoly and are the dominant player.\n\nSony is much more than just Playstation.  Their company is hitting on all cylinders in movies, music, image sensors, etc, but I focus on gaming because that's where I see the real potential.  If Playstation was its own entity trading on the Nasdaq, would it not garner at least a $200 billion valuation?  10x sales is not that much for a company growing at the clip that PS network services has been the last few years.  And yet here we are, with Sony's total valuation ex cash sitting at 50% of that.\n\nGaming is still in its infancy.  NES in 1985 was the first time gaming became mainstream. Investing in gaming now is akin to investing in Ford in the 1950s.  Sony's biggest mistake was not selling the PS5 for $699 because it's clear that many people will pay that, but I still think they are setup very well for the future.  I would pay 127B market cap for Playstation division alone, everything else that Sony produces is just icing on the cake.  \n\nChange my mind.  Tell me why I'm wrong on Sony.  I don't expect them to be as big as Apple, but I don't think a 300-500b market cap is unreasonable if they continue growing gaming earnings at the current pace.",

        "selftext": " So AAPL stock has been pretty ugly. BUT, I have hope.. \n\nAAPL looks like it's coming up to its 200 SMA of 117.29.. So its got further to fall here. However, in the past it's jumped up from its 200 SMA pretty reliably as far as I can tell. I'm going to wait until it falls there and start\u00a0looking at buying opportunities.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbeozgedz9q61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f896d6f83f9f4c1c1eac0432c44c151479588bf\n\nI'm using a tool to project the expected move up or down. Based on what you think AAPL will do it'll be either +15% or \u201315% by June.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/047kru8hz9q61.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8288ea022a2d49b29a3bb82aaf06d1112531ee7d\n\nI'm think it's likely AAPL will go up, so now that I know the magnitude, I'm going to be looking into calls. Checking my projections tool, I see 6/18/2021 105 Call and 120 Calls might be great picks. I'll be watching these when SMA breaks 200. Going into both calls means we'll be looking at about 94% profit by expiry if the market is at 15%.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c2293wkz9q61.png?width=1495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cb6ecc37f44074892d326dc940488e5eabcc653\n\nHowever, if you think it'll go \u201315% instead, or if we start seeing Apple drop past 200 for too long, we might want to look into puts. 6/18/2021 135 Put looks like it'll do the job in this scenario. It'll have a 91% profit by expiry if the market is at \u201315%.\u00a0  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zmycvdaoz9q61.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f736b8bdb43dae2290f7391ba9fbf8771bb29039\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: AAPL's been ugly, however we're looking like we'll hit the bottom soon so I'm looking into June calls",

If it survives I'll edit it with all the DD you can stand, but otherwise just click on my profile an look for my WFC (Wells Fargo) DD. Here's the TL;DR  \n\n\n1.) WFC is a bank that was in the doghouse. Fed says it can come out and play now.  \n2.) WFC is a bank and banks do well in high interest rate environments. Rates are skyrocketing right now.\n\n3.) WFC is one of the only big banks that hasn't reached it's pre-pandemic highs, meaning it still has room to run.\n\n4.) When Ryan Cohen sold his stake in Chewy he invested it into just two stocks, AAPL and WFC. You could buy AAPL, but that's a tech stock that isn't going to do as well in a high interest rate &amp; high inflation environment as a bank.\n\n5.) Michael Burry initiated a large position (3.3% of his fund) in WFC last quarter. You all know what happened last time Burry and Cohen agreed on stock.\n\n6.) WFC has really freakin' cheap options. June 45c (that's about 22% out of the money) were going for 80 cents today. IF WFC gets to $50 by June (about 34% gain) those calls would be worth $5 intrinsically. That's over 500% gains on the calls, I'm sure you can do the math if it goes higher.  \n\n\nPositions - 60 June 50c, 15 June 45c, 20 March 40c, 10 March 42.5c, 150 Shares.",

        "selftext": "Monday's earnings call was Canoo's single largest event since it deSPACed ($HCAC =&gt; $GOEV). For those who don't know me, I've written the original [Canoo/BangBus DD last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzioed/mega_dd_bangbus_ev_going_public_everything_you/) which speculated the Apple partnership ([which turned out to be true](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)), I'm a mod on r/canoo, I'm active in most Canoo channels (Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits, Discord and etc) and I love to share whatever I stumble across (like [leaking the Canoo pickup truck](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/)). This is not financial advice, I am not employed by Canoo nor represent them in any way and I do have a position in Canoo (see below).\n\nI'll start off with this number: **$8.9m**. This is how much Tony Aquila (Canoo's Chairman) personally lost between Monday's close and Tuesday's close. While we've all lost in the past day (I personally lost six-figures), Tony has lost more than any of us. While I'm not apologizing for him, I'm sure he too feels the fire of deep red in his investment. However, much of what Tony said, absolutely needed to be said. The moves he made has set up Canoo for long term success and I'll explain why.\n\nI was looking forward to the Contract Engineering revenue and became disappointed when we did not see it. I truly believed this additional revenue stream would've been huge in the short term price movement. After all, OEMs are reaching out to Canoo for their expertise, while other companies are rolling trucks down hills or [trying to build vehicles that don't erupt in flames](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39788/lordstown-motors-endurance-prototype-caught-fire-ten-minutes-into-first-test-drive). Having listened to Tony's reasoning and looking at [Canoo's financials](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/52/canoo-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results), I completely understand why he nixed the Contract Engineering.\n\nLet's go back to the end of 2019. Canoo was a young company. Developing electric vehicles is very capital intensive. Canoo's liabilities exceeded their assets, and at the end of 2019 they had a mere $31m in cash with $11m in current liabilities. While Canoo developed a great product, and held some cash, it may have not been enough to continue to gamma stages let alone enough capital to build vehicles for their subscription model. On the heels of Stefan Krause being ousted, Canoo was in turmoil. Senior members saw the writing on the wall, and started to leave in 2019 to early 2020. So, Uli Kranz (CTO, then interim CEO) and the remaining engineers did what they do best, find projects to work on. Enter Hyundai.\n\nWhile the partnership with Hyundai may not have been ideal, it would've doubled Canoo's cash on hand. With a world-class engineering team on idle, it seemed like a really great idea to reallocate resources. As the saying goes, one in the hand, is better than two in the bush.\n\nHowever, in hindsight, it turned out to be a terrible deal. Keep in mind Canoo's skateboard cost $250m to develop. We initially speculated the Contract Engineering revenue was $34m, but on the earnings call, it turned out to be even less at $25m. Furthermore, it's very difficult to differentiate your own IP versus the work you've been contracted for:\n\n* If you developed a better skateboard for your client, you cannot use this superior skateboard as it belongs to the client.\n* If you developed a worse skateboard for your client, you've now knowingly given your client an inferior product (see [Tesla vs Fisker](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-vs-fisker-the-epilogue-or-why-tesla-owes-fisker-11-million-3052/)).\n* If you give your client your skateboard as-is, the client just received a skateboard that takes 3-5 years to design/engineer and possibly billions ([Faraday](https://www.businessinsider.com/jia-yueting-faraday-future-tesla-rival-bankrupt-2020-1)) if not $500+ million ([Dyson](https://electrek.co/2020/05/18/dyson-cancelled-electric-car/#:~:text=Dyson%20has%20unveiled%20its%20abandoned,on%20its%20own%20electric%20vehicle)), for a measly $25m. Congratulations, you just played yourself.\n\nAs you can see, none of these scenarios are ideal for Canoo. If I were Hyundai, I'd be all over this deal too. No wonder Hyundai was so quick to jump on this deal, especially after announcing their partnership with Arrival just a month prior.\n\nWith this conflict of interest, I now see why many automakers are turning their backs to Apple. Why help a competitor to make a better product, for very minimal upside for yourself? As an engineer that signed up to join an exciting start-up like Canoo, would you be happy if you were pimped out to another company to engineer something that's not better, but not worse, but not the same, as something you've already created?\n\nWith that being said, Tuesday's price action was absolutely blown out of proportion, and I took advantage and bought GOEV warrants ($GOEVW) with both hands. Remember, we never knew details of the deal with Hyundai. Now knowing that the Contract Engineering would've produced minimal revenue, no royalties/on-going income, while delaying core projects, wouldn't you have cut this too? By killing the Contract Engineering, Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing tophats, factories and etc). For quick math, Canoo foregone $25m in contract revenue. Let's assume Magna would've charged $5000 for each vehicle. If Canoo instead reallocated resources towards building a facility, they would earn all that lost revenue within the first year ($5000 x 10,000 vehicles first year = $50m saved), while protecting their own IP.\n\nAlso, an important fact to consider was that Tony revealed that the contract value was based on labor of engineers (e.g. hourly rate), not value of IP. Meaning, Canoo charged a mark-up on top of their existing employee\u2019s salary, rather than charging based on the hundreds of millions (if not billions) in IP they were receiving. While I do think Uli is a great leader, this was a great misstep under his watch.\n\nWith all the focus on the Hyundai agreement, we lost sight of gems uncovered in the earnings report/call:\n\n* Internationalization. Lots of demand in Europe. International sales coming online soon.\n* Better idea of cash on hand and operating expenses.\n   * We are in a very healthy financial position. One-third of our market cap is cash. Canoo also has a mere $27m in current liabilities and &lt;$7m in long-term debt. **If this isn\u2019t a deep value play, I don\u2019t know what is.**\n* Timeline and order of models have not changed: LV, MPDV, PU. We are still on track for production next year.\n* Working closely with State Governors to obtain the greatest benefits/incentives.\n   * These discussions could save tens or even hundreds of millions down the road. While I would\u2019ve liked to get confirmation on Monday, we cannot rush this crucial process.\n* Acknowledged Investor Relation's lack of communication.\n\nTony also stated some milestones to look out for:\n\n* Gamma vehicle progress.\n* Reporting reservations vs pre-orders.\n* Lock in geographics and contract manufacturing partners.\n* State level partnerships.\n\nAs of Tuesday\u2019s close, Canoo had a $2b market cap. Canoo has $700m in cash, and IP worth anywhere from $250m to $1b+. In comparison, Fisker has a $5b market cap and virtually no IP, no engineering and no proprietary technology. Lucid, which has a \\~$40b market cap, is worth 20x Canoo, yet, they are only months apart from manufacturing. Canoo at a $2b market cap (&lt;$10 share price) is an absolute steal in comparison to other players in the field.\n\n**My bull case from last year still applies. The $18/$25/$30 price targets for management's earn out shares applies. I still have a $30 price target, which I'm confident we'll hit this year.**\n\n**Positions: 130,001 warrants.** These warrants should be worth $18+ once GOEV hits $30.\n\n[$GOEV - 130,001 warrants](https://preview.redd.it/gb6dtnwwkeq61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e87d38cc703d91c43b8d227e121187d7e3f0c12b)\n\n**TLDR: Canoo's deal with Hyundai was terrible. Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing top hats, factories and etc). Production and model timeline is still on track.**",

        "selftext": "RKT ipo'd at $19 back in August.  The Gilford family spent 35 year building them into the largest mortgage orginator in the world.  They survived every downturn even the '07 Mortgagepocolypse, each time growing and taking share.\n\nThey didn't need no cash, they came public to establish themselves in the public market and begin planning for the some day when death taxes require the family to settle up with the irs.\n\nThe Gilfords built a $50 Billion company from scratch, its a story right up there with Buffet and Bezos but this family gets no respect.   They should.  \n\nThe biz:\n\nBanks make loans, sometimes they make the mortgage thing to apes who have \"civilized\" and live in house things.  I sleep in the woods and swing from trees, but many of my so called 'evolved' cousins like this house living bullshit.  Well banks only have a handful of people in house who loan house mortages (i know weird).  They rely on these fly by night boiler rooms who send emails and call you unexpectedly, you think its about your car warranty or solar but this is that other sales call about Refi-Cash-Out into a Fixed Fully Ammortizing 30 year or buying a rental with a 5/1 ARM Fixed-Floating with rolled in closing costs.  \n\nIts really a bunch of bullshit, mortgages, roofs, solar panels.  I like bananas, but I like this stonk called RKT.  \n\nMorgages are hard, they want paperworks, bank statements, adp payroll slips.  The business comes in waves.  When rates are cheap and banks full of new dollar tokens given to them by  JPOW, there is a long line of house living apes trying to mortage their paychecks from 30 years on so they can install a pool or move to a neighborhood with a country club.  So the banks call on these boiler rooms to make all the paper mortgage calls happen.\n\nThese 'orginiators' are typically like circus pop up tent companies.  They hire a bunch of unemployed used car saleman and maniacs froms the sober house to call the leads and take the applications.  They hire Amanda and Britney who couldn't succeed as beauticians to do the document reviews and processing.  Simply put its the cast of heros you used to see on episodes of COPS where the call was a 'domestic.'  \n\nBut the Gilfords had a vision: build software that runs on devices that make it so easy to apply, qualify and process a mortgage that even Rodney with 5 days outa rehab and Britney 'I told your ass to send me that already' couldn't screw it up and the customer gets their house money fast and easy right from the app on their handheld glowing glass screen.\n\nHedge funds don't understand how good this software is.  No one else bothered to build it because bankers are not creative, they live by screwing others.  And the other circus freaks pushing mortgages are in it for next week commish check so they can coke and hookers.  \n\nStonk is at $26\n\nThe Hedges shorted 40 mil shares on a 115 mil float.  And index fund already bought 11 mil shares (invesco).   The original fund managers who bought the ipo sold it out during the last blast up to $43.  They sold, bc they saw morgage rates go up a 1/2 point and figured the circus is over and all these pop up freak show mortgage boiler rooms are going under.  They didn't bother to look at rkt.  They have a 90% repeat business rate: meaning 9/10 customers who do a mortgage with rocket, will use rocket if they do another.  typicall number in bankin is 1 or 2 out of 10.  RKT app is number 1 in the catagory, and as Mamma Cathy Wood teached me smooth ape brain: innovation is a winner take all game.  \n\nRKT builds back better each downturn, and every mortgage boom brings in startup circus creeps that don't know how to code, analyst customer data (data science) and deliver good service.  Why should they? they believe its a churn and burn business.  They are running flee market stores, RKT is runnnin and Amazon of mortgages and now getting into car and personal loans\n\nThey don't take credit risk, they lend for banks and investor pools.  they \"service\" the loan which means they bill and collect.  so when rates fluctuate they have to adjust the holding value of the collection rights up or down any quarter.  Hedgefunds predict that higher rates mean they take a write down.  But thats just paper bullshit.  the collection rights always are profitable, they just have to 'discount' them when banks same interest is worth more.  Hedgefunds look for quick profits, not revolutionary businesses that make lives better.\n\nThey missed tsla, apple, amzn and countless others the same way.  RKT is no diff.\n\nThe company minted coin in 2020, about $4.50/share in profit.  Thats a PE of like 6.  Now no one thinks they will make that in '21.  2020 was the best mortgage year ever, people sat at home, watched netflix and bought and refinanced houses.  They also learned to use their phones and their computers for the first time ever.  They can now work and do businness on them, before they didn't, but covid make them overcome their fear and forced all the boomers to use their phone to get a mortgage.   the secular story of waiting for the apes who know how to use an app to move out of mom's basement to buy a house is over.  The boomers learned to use apps and now, all businesses will suceed or fail based on the quality of the app experience.  Did i mention RKTs apps are all number 1 or near in their catagories and great reveiws.  \n\nBeing number 1 and having great reviews in the app store makes it game over.  Its winner take all.  RKT will clean up in the down turn.  they will earn less with less business and higher rates but the long term earnings power of this company is $2-3/share and growing every downturn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CEO of RKT: This Guy Fucks!](https://preview.redd.it/9wt6lcae0bn61.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97969bbe977a7211c3477c7aedc7ccfb19175aa7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bet my account the stonk would go up over 28.89 this friday b/c i YOLO'd the mother fucking FDs.",

The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding in expected earnings growth into the calculation.\n\no\tA lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. According to well-known investor Peter Lynch, a company's P/E and expected growth should be equal, which denotes a fairly valued company and supports a PEG ratio of 1.0.

        "selftext": "*reprinted from an earlier commentt I made elsewhere on the boards*\n\n**Time Value of Money (TVM)** is the central principle of all finance, and it can work for you or against you. It's applicable to everything: Giving up some money now for more money later, or buying a dollar for sixty cents versus the other way around.\n\nThe Time Value of Money equation can be expressed as:\n\nFV = PV x (1 + r)^(nt)\n\nWhere FV is the future value of an asset. PV is the present value. r is the rate of return. n is the number of times compounded per term. t is the term (in years) compounded. e.g. if you are compounding monthly for 30 years then n = 12, t = 30, nt = 12 \\* 30 = 360.\n\nWhen you're a borrower, you're paying the premium. When you're a depositor and investor, you're collecting the premium... provided that you are properly pricing assets and not buying into the inflated premiums speculators attach to stocks on the front end.\n\nIf you're old enough to remember, there was this game for the Apple \\]\\[ called *Taipan!* that taught Time Value of Money and compound interest in a very interesting way:\n\nThe game involved being a trader on the China Sea. It was basically the predecessor to Dope Wars... you would fight pirates, collect their treasure, buy bigger ships, buy cannons, trade arms, silk, cargo and opium. Opium was like a day trading stock. It could skyrocket for no reason. And you could get rich, then you'd get mugged by robbers and lose all your cash.\n\nYou have this Elder Brother Wu who is basically a loan shark. He can loan you money but he'll loan it to you at a usurious rate of interest... it compounds 10 percent *per turn.* And if you don't pay him off *he'll send his bodyguards to cut your throat.*\n\n**BUT THERE'S A GLITCH...**\n\nIf you repay Wu more money than you owe him, suddenly you have a negative balance... and it grows at the same rate of interest, but in your favor. He owes you 10 percent compounded per turn.\n\nIf you play this out for a while, your balance with him grows into the billions and trillions and hundreds of trillions of British pounds. Pretty soon, the risk of getting mugged over \u00a33 million in opium seems worthless, because by this point in the game you're making more than ~~ten~~ 1000 times that just moving from port to port, causing Wu to incur [humongous interest](https://i.imgur.com/4VtO2BL.png).\n\n**That** is why you should always be, literally, on the right side of the Time Value of Money equation.",

In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).\n\nThis industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto\n\nu/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: \"Zombie cars and QNX\n\nQNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.\n\nBlackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.\n\nFast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?\n\nSONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.\n\nYou might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\"\n\n3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. \n\nBB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\\_interest\\_in\\_bb\\_its\\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) \n\nTLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month",

        "selftext": "Not financial advice.\n\nI don\u2019t want to scare anyone, that is not my intention in writing this post. Rather a warning to those who are less educated in what moves the market. I bet 90% of you reading this don\u2019t even know what a government bond is (this was originally meant for WSB, I assume more than 10% of you know what Bonds are here lol). Buckle up, I\u2019m about to blow your socks off with this publicly available information and maybe even help you not lose money, or even make some if you play it right!\u00a0\n\nAt this point I find it impossible to argue that we are not in a bubble. Let me explain why I think we are about to witness a market correction the likes of which we haven't seen since 1929.\n\nThe bond market is related to interest rates and inflation because the bonds issued by the U.S. treasury serve as a debt holding between the treasury and the fed.\n\nA bond is basically an IOU of the government. They are debts. The treasury yield is the return you get for buying the government's debt.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeds control the money supply and interest rates by buying and selling bonds. To INCREASE money supply they will buy bonds back from the banks, which is the fed buying back their own debts. In turn, this gives the banks more money to put into circulation. The fed can REDUCE the money supply by selling the bonds. When this happens, it reduces money in circulation because the fed puts it in the \"safe\" so to speak.\u00a0\n\nRising treasury yield means lowering demand for bonds. Investors increasingly prefer high risk investments. (As seen with the disruptive growth sector exploding \\[think Cathie Wood's ARK\\])\u00a0\n\nThat causes the demand for bonds to be low. When the demand is low, prices of bonds are at a discount, and the treasury yield goes up which gives an investor more incentive to buy in.\u00a0\n\nBUT, if the demand for bonds is EXTREMELY low, how can the fed fight inflation? They can't decrease the money supply as discussed above because there's no buyers for their bonds!!!\u00a0\n\nSo instead, they print more money. 40% of all dollars in circulation were printed during the pandemic. Naturally, this makes the dollar lose value.\u00a0\n\nThe OTHER way to decrease inflation and money supply is through raising interest rates, which takes money out of circulation from the investors pockets, and back to the fed.\u00a0\n\nHOWEVER, it is clear Jerome Powell doesn't want to raise interest rates (currently). They want borrowers to borrow more money. Banks won't do it though, as they have no incentive to do so (low interest rates are bad for banks because they make less money on their loans)\u00a0\n\nSo, they do it in the repo market. They lend money out to institutions and hedge funds, Which puts money in the stock market. This is what has been causing the massive bull run and the \"to the moon!\" or \"only go up\" sentiment of retail investors currently.\u00a0\n\nMy first big warning sign was the treasury yield hitting 1.5%. The next one would be the fed stopping repos.\u00a0\n\nInterest rates low means everyone is naturally pumping money into the markets.\u00a0\n\nThis is because your Apple, Tesla, Google, Netflix etc have extremely high debt as compared to the biggest corporations of 50 years ago. And nowadays corporations can leverage their debt.\u00a0\n\nSo, if Company X is in 100 billion debt, they can refinance that debt from the loaner and invest the 100 billion.\n\nso now instead of 100 billion debt it's 200 because they invested borrowed money. What happens when you invest borrowed money and the market crashes, except on a massive corporate scale?\u00a0\n\nDebt is through the roof while investors are MANIC, no other time in history have investors been as manic now as in the 1920s.\u00a0\n\nThink about it... roaring 20s: rich got richer poor got poorer\u00a0\n\nBut that\u2019s just looking at it fundamentally\n\nAttached you will find charts of $DJX, the first being 1990 to 2020 without the covid crash.\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/DYIp2R3](https://imgur.com/DYIp2R3)\n\nThe second is $DJX from 1915 to 1945.\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZlBEeRM](https://imgur.com/ZlBEeRM)\n\nIn the earlier graph, there was a flash crash followed by about a year of recovery before the bigger crash ensued. Now look at the 1990-2020. We just had our covid crash, a year later we're pumping to all time highs. Look familiar?\n\nIt was a 90% correction when it all came crashing down in the roaring twenties...\u00a0\n\nAnd not to get political, but Democrats have had a tendency throughout history to act like everything is okay until the very last second. Think 2007 recession with the democratic senate and house. No one thought it was a bubble, everyone was saying everything's fine.\u00a0\n\nOn top of that, Michael burry recently tweeted (I believe it was since deleted, I can't seem to find it) something along the lines of \"Last time I warned you and nobody listened. This time I warn you again, and still no one listens. But this time I will have proof I warned.\" Something big is about to go down.\n\nIn my opinion, it is a ticking time bomb. ",

        "selftext": "Hopefully this covers the information you are looking for.\n\nOn Friday I said I felt Tootsie Toll was a good short squeeze candidate for this week because of how it has been trading for the last month and the percentage of short shares. Some of the information will contradict my previous post as this is much more thorough and I believe it still supports the opinion it will run this week and we all know how different sites always offer different information. I am hoping this will clarify as much as I can. A couple people asked for more DD on the subject so here is some more info I have been able to put together.\n\nTootsie Roll Industries, Inc., together with its subsidiaries,  manufactures and sells confectionery products primarily in the United  States, Canada, and Mexico. The company sells its products under the  Tootsie Roll, Tootsie Pops, Child's Play, Caramel Apple Pops, Charms,  Blow-Pop, Charms Mini Pops, Cella's, Dots, Junior Mints, Charleston  Chew, Sugar Daddy, Sugar Babies, Andes, Fluffy Stuff, Dubble Bubble,  Razzles, Cry Baby, Nik-L-Nip, and Tutsi Pop trademarks. It sells its  products directly to wholesale distributors of candy and groceries,  supermarkets, variety stores, dollar stores, chain grocers, drug chains,  discount chains, cooperative grocery associations, mass merchandisers,  warehouse and membership club stores, vending machine operators, the  United States military, and fund-raising charitable organizations, as  well as through candy and grocery brokers. The company was founded in  1896 and is based in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThis company has a market cap of 2.4 billion, has an P/E ratio of 40.16 and had an operating revenue of 471.1 Million in 2020 even with Covid. Has positive cash flow of 1.53 a share and a book value of 11.66 a share.  In the last 10 Years other than 2020 their revenue has never been below 500 Million. The company was established in 1896 and invented the Tootsie Roll for which they are named in 1931. It was listed on the NYSE in 1922 under the name Sweets Company of America. Lots of details here... [https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/85/Tootsie-Roll-Industries-Inc.html](https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/85/Tootsie-Roll-Industries-Inc.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Why will this go up this week. The short information is the stock has been steadily increasing in price hitting as high as $36 in after-hours trading on Friday. This is a chart showing performance against the DOW and NADAQ over the last month. As you can see while the markets have been flat $TR has been a steady bull climbing steadily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8kmz3viw3n61.jpg?width=714&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a0d44abd918663e9a998f5be4187ca7f7fc4ce3\n\nOf the known shareholders several familiar names are in the list. First the insiders, the Gordon family are the Originating family and were worth more than a billion dollars i9n 2015. When Melvin Gordon Passed away his wife Ellen became CEO and Chaiman. Ellen along with her daughters, make up over 60% of the company shares.\n\n*Processing img buhnjsglw3n61...*\n\nIn addition to the Family's direct ownership several familiar funds hold a another 19.61%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 572ml6fzw3n61...*\n\nShort position on this stock is sitting at 25.9%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bgjygj0x3n61.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=915462b4765550be24d770443caa6ade080a234d\n\nSo we have a solid American company with huge history, Large family ownership and institutional ownership with a significant short position. I surmise that the shorts are lower than the stock is now and as the stock keeps moving up, on low volume while the rest of the market seems undecided, those shorts have to be looking for the best time to cover. I don't think they are going to get easy fills based on how the stock has been trading so, that means they are going to have to over bid to cover or market bid and see where it goes. Either way this is going higher as these hedgies are going to cover.\n\nYou don't have to agree but hopefully if you do look at the information and do a bit of DD yourself, you should see what I do. I am not offering price targets. I just think it is going up and I think some panic buying is going to push it.  \n\nGood Luck Everyone.",

In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, lead analyst David Vogt says that a \"more stable long-term iPhone demand backdrop with better [average selling prices]\" and Apple's \"likely entry into the auto market\" are driving the UBS revision on AAPL shares. The analyst says that, based on analysis, aggregate iPhone demand in 2021 and 2022 should be relatively stable. He doesn't believe there's a \"supercycle\" materializing, but he did raise his 2021 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million, up from 215 million. Looking ahead to 2022, Vogt also raised his 2022 iPhone shipment estimate to 215 million, up 10 million. He attributes the bump to the \"stickiness of the iPhone ecosystem.\"\n\nhttps://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/31/ubs-upgrades-aapl-to-buy-raises-price-target-on-iphone-stability-auto-opportunity",

And it's possible to guesstimate if they are in talks if Rawlinson gets asked the question, if Lucid will build the Apple car. \n\nNo talks: He *must* deny it according to NYSE rules\n\nTalks: He will most likely say \"no comment\" just like 2-3 weeks ago, when he was asked whether they are in talks with CCIV.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reasons in favor and against a partnership:**\n\n([5:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=309s)\u200b) 1st reason in favor: Tesla Dream Team Doug Field (current project leader of Project Titan) &amp; Peter Hochholdinger (Vice President of Manufacturing at Lucid) \n\n([6:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=360s)\u200b) 2nd reason in favor: Fit in what Apple and Lucid want and need \n\n([9:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=568s)\u200b) 3rd reason in favor: Brand fit \n\n([10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=621s)\u200b) 1st reason against it: Currently just rumors \n\n([10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=635s)\u200b) 2nd reason against it: Lucid is not established yet \n\n([11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=667s)\u200b) 3rd reason in favor: Lucid is currently relatively small \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think on a scale from 1 (no talks) to 10 (talks are happening) ? :)",

        "selftext": "Hey y'all,\n\nAs the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.\n\nI'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT\n\nLooking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up into what they are today, what, in your eyes are those stocks and why?\n\nMy research has led me to consider the following:\n\n**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform\n\n**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.\n\n**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.\n\nNext up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI\n\n**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been\n\n**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys\n\n**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.\n\n**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show\n\n**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back\n\nNotable mentions: CRWD, NET, ZM, LMND\n\nIn terms of value, I'd consider **BA, BRK-B**",

        "selftext": "Short term the market is unpredictable, and very long term also becomes increasingly difficult to prevede what will happen, because of the cumulative effect of future new events.\n\nSo what do you think are the best bets today, considering both potential upside and risk, if you hope to see a profit or simply are willing to completely change your portfolio composition within a couple years?\n\nI\u2019m long on the aerospace industry, with Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus and Rolls Royce. They have been beaten up because of the pandemic but I assume they will recover nicely within the time. They can be volatile though.\n\nLong Visa and MasterCard, as the move to cashless payments is surely a continuing trend.\nI see a couple risks here. One is disruption by other companies. Consumer facing brands with a large user base, especially Apple Amazon and Google, have already stepped in the field and could eventually try to create their own payment networks. Then there is possible government disruption, with the move to digital currency, that could affect their margins.\n\nGetting more speculative, PayPal is tempting because it had such a great run and then a pullback, but seems also a lot more risk, both comparatively overvalued and easier to replace.\n\nTravel recovery looks also like a safe bet, Delta United Hilton Marriot are some interesting names, Airbnb even, but I\u2019d be interested in finding good alternatives.\n\nE-commerce, Amazon MercadoLibre and Alibaba are at the moment in widely different situations, but on the whole I suspect they will do well in a couple years.\nMELI is a growth stock, which is toxic these days, but appears it may honestly grow. BABA is undervalued because China, but I\u2019m confident Jack Ma and the government will find a middle ground as they have largely common interests.\n\nStill the relations between China and much of the rest of the world are rapidly deteriorating, something I\u2019m very concerned about, but the greatest worry is that the effect could spill well beyond Chinese stocks.\n\nShorting a bunch of EV and Green energy names is a temptation, but handling the volatility would require a huge margin and the risk high. Meh.\n\nPSTH is a tempting speculative play, mostly because of the name of Ackman, since it\u2019s back close to the initial offering price. Even though SPACs are fast falling out of favor, this one has been widely publicized and could see a nice bump of a merger is announced.\n\nYour thought on the above and other ideas?",

        "selftext": "Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.\n\nSo I'm a very disciplined person and since my first job back when I was 17 y/o i've been saving 100% of my income every single month. I'm a software engineer and since i'm still young, i'm still living with my parents and help the household with secondary sources of income such as freelance work and etcetera. \n\nThe thing is, it's been over 5 years and I'm still in the red. I always read that time in the market beats timing the markets, the story about the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, but for some reason this doesn't apply to me. Back when I started it was kinda difficult to invest in foreign markets, so most of my portfolio is basically my country's index, $ECH (Chile IPSA index), which has done nothing but go down in the last 5 years from its $55USD high to the current $33.6 where it's sitting right now.\n\nA while ago i discovered a fintech that allows us chileans to invest in the US tech sector (a fund composed of ARKK, ARKW, Tesla, Apple and such), and since a lot of people said 2021 was the \"year of recovery\", I diversified with that... and 3 days later the treasury-yield crash came and that's now in the red too. The saddest thing is, not only did I start investing my monthly salary in the tech sector, but also a payment from a freelance job i had been working in since early 2020, so I lost a bunch of money with the recent crash because I didn't DCA. Now, the reason i didn't DCA is 1) i believed in analysts saying 2021 was the year of recovery and 2) i had a horrible experience with DCA'ing in ECH, as i \"buy the dip\" but it keeps getting lower and lower. It doesn't matter that i bought cheaper the next month: it just keeps going lower and lower.\n\nI honestly don't know why I have such bad luck. I can't withdraw my money even if i wanted to because of the losses (I don't want to do so anyways) and i would've been much better just spending everything instead in a car, a house or something.\n\nHow can I stop losing all of my income?

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I posted a [$17k yolo on ZNGA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw3ts3/17k_yolo_znga/) and bumped it up to $27k total yesterday.\n\nWhile everyone was crying about the market taking a shit and RKT crashing ([I was crying too](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx7mlz/rkt_12k_114k_17k/)) it was announced ZNGA acquired a game studio, [Echtra Games](https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/03/zynga-acquires-diablo-co-creators-echtra-games-in-expansion-to-pc-and-consoles/), whose creator and his team played a pivital role in Diablo/Diablo II. They were acquired with the goal to help Zynga move into PC/cross-platform game play. I think this is a promising acquisition with lots of future potential and is just [one of many planned for this year](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/).\n\nThe CEO of Zynga also spoke at a conference with Morgan Stanley today. Below are some excerpts he said during the call that I found interesting .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Well known established global IP + data driven iteration + proven game mechanics =** \ud83d\ude80\n\n&gt;We like to learn from what we've done before. And in the case of Harry Potter that was a big element of it. One of the things that we learned was we needed an intellectual property in a world that was appealing to a much larger audience and a much more global audience, so that a lot of the cool game play features that we had could reach a bigger audience. So we combined a new IP with some proven mechanics that we'd been messing around with. And then we tested it for a very long period of time and test markets. That's really the structural difference between mobile and console.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In mobile, you can really test market something to remove a lot of the introduction risk. And so with Harry Potter that was something that we did as we went into whether it was Australia or Canada, we were testing very specific elements of what makes for a successful game. Does it retain? Does it engage? What's the conversion rates? Does the UA scale against what the cost of acquisition is? And so, we thoroughly put Harry Potter through its test marketing phases. And what we're really excited about was first and foremost the reception from fans was phenomenal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We saw - the ratings were very strong. The Harry Potter fans were raving about it. It went really viral. We did some fun stuff with Zayn Malik. And it really had really a lot of nice momentum out of the launch. But then when it started to hit weeks 14, 30 and beyond, all the testing that we had done about what were the retention rates engagements, we were exceeding them. So it was actually really positive to see that the test marketing worked and that was a critical part of the success here.\n\nThe Harry Potter IP is a money machine. If you can integrate the game mechanics that get people to continually make micro transactions, or spend hours playing, combined with a raving fan base of an established global IP, imo this is going to print money for them.\n\nThe Harry Potter game was [launched on Sep/23](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-launches-harry-potter-puzzles-spells-worldwide). I think we could see a lift in revenue in the coming quarters from this game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2 Upcoming Game Releases in the First Half**\n\nThey're targeting 2 new game releases in the first half \"Puzzle Combat\" and \"FarmVille 3\".\n\n**On Puzzle Combat**\n\n&gt;So as we think about releasing Puzzle Combat in the first half, I wouldn't necessarily set the expectations that this is a theatrical movie model where it's - a Marvel movie that comes out at summer and it's got this huge spike. That's not at all the model here, right. We're in this for the long-term. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And so, we're going to be releasing the game, see how it settles in and then very methodically start acquiring based on what we're seeing in the dynamics and the metrics.\n\n**On FarmVille**\n\n&gt;And, there are a lot of fans that have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people had played FarmVille over the years. And when we think about all of those fans and what their expectations are and how to bring them into a new experience, we\u2019ve doing a lot of testing. We\u2019re also running a bunch of FarmVille games right now, whether it\u2019s Country Escape or Tropic Escape, which has a very big fan base and they love the game.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And so it\u2019s a little bit more complicated to navigate some of the pre-set expectations, but what we\u2019ve done is really build out a terrific new experience and experience that is unlike LA. It has things that are familiar to people that have played FarmVille in the past, but it\u2019s got a lot of unique new elements to it, and a new look and feel that feels very modern and very cutting edge for what we believe mobile games really are these days.\n\nPuzzle Combat is more of a long play, and I like these types of strategies mixed in with shorter term plays. Zynga seems to have a healthy balance of this, which I really like.\n\nWhat I think Zynga does well is tailoring their games to the fan base. I think FV3 is going to be a fresh reboot of the beloved game by its fans with new elements to keep users engaged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Expansion into cross-platform gaming**\n\nAs mentioned, they acquired Echtra to boost their expansion into cross-platform gaming. Unrelated to the acquisition, one of the first cross-platform titles later this year will be Star Wars Hunters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Yeah. I think if you take a step back and look at the industry overall, some of the largest franchises in the world right now are cross-platform, and they\u2019re free to play in many cases with seasons passes and things like Fortnite, Pub G, Engine Impact, a lot of people have been talking about how the console developers getting into mobiles the thing. Well, I think that door swings both ways. I think mobile developers can actually step into the cross-platform mega franchise part of the market, because of a few reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding the team they acquired:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I think the last point I\u2019d make on cross-platform is that. We\u2019re just getting started in this. So the acquisition of Echtra is really a key one for us, because ultimately game quality is a function of game team talent and leadership. And when you look at these guys, they\u2019ve worked on RPGs for up their whole careers. They\u2019ve worked on Diablo, they helped to create Torchlight, which is a fantastic IP and the action RPG category. They\u2019ve actually published games cross-platform. It\u2019s a team less than 50 in San Francisco right near our shop.\n\nI think if the launch of Star Wars Hunters goes well in the second half of the year then I think it's possible we see a nice upward movement on the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Becoming a first party ads platform cutting out third party platforms like Google/Apple**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;...mid-point the last year, we started looking at the fact that we were one of the premier advertisers in gaming. All of our games are enabled for IAP and IAA. But between the time that they saw an ad and they ended up in our game, we had it was kind of opaque, right. We worked with other parties \u2013 other third particles or use other third-parties like, Iron Source or Unity app and Google, Facebook, and the third-parties were handling a lot of the information and a lot of the acquisition. And then we looked at our first party data asset, which is the data that we were generating around what a player was doing inside of our games.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And that was tremendously valuable, but we were missing that piece of it. And so when we looked at it, we said, wait a second. If we do a couple of things here, we can capture the 15% to 30% we\u2019re paying partners right now, just to manage the exchanges. We would get more information about what\u2019s hot, and what\u2019s not at the top of the funnel in terms of what\u2019s appealing? What\u2019s not appealing? What companies or products are doing better and why? We would be able to creatively optimize our products better. We ended in a post IDFA world that would all become first party data. The big issue with privacy is what is one party exchanging to another party about an individual, right? But if you enter one network and you have a good exchange of what your permissions are, you carry through that whole process in a high fidelity way from a data standpoint.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And so when we looked at it from multiple directions, we're like, wow, we can margin expand, we can pick up more efficiency in our UA dollars and in our advertising business. We could grow our advertising business faster and we could generate potentially a competitive advantage and information superiority, just knowing more about the players coming into our walled garden or into our platform than the next guy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We felt like this was something that we could go after. We went through a very diligent process of breaking down what these look like. And we found that some of these components we could build, some of these components we need to partner on and in addition to that in ad tech, there's a lot of - there's really a lot of vibrant companies and opportunities out there to potentially partner as you've seen from recent development.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So when we think about where we were as a company, we were a mobile pure play developer and publisher and we felt that that is a really valuable company, but we thought that we could become an even more valuable company by building out our platform by starting to grow our total addressable market by getting into consoles and PCs, and then leveraging this unique asset and hyper casual to really supercharge the platform as well as get us into a place where we're seeing more information coming into the top of the funnel and then converting them into players and ultimately payers.\"\n\nThis really sticks out to me. Zynga was 1 step ahead from the new pivot by Apple/Google on stronger ad tracking privacy. They're becoming the ads exchange where companies pay for displaying ads in games. This also gives them an advantage on learning what's working for others and apply that to their business model.\n\n[Here's a bite sized](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljywic/znga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) DD u/jojofroyo did.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research.\n\nPositions: $27k with various calls throughout the year. I think they could have a great ER to justify a new target price from analysts, so went with a higher strike price after their next ER.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou0ssust3yk61.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6428b78f70093d7da7337952a6fe46bf0200a9a1",

Since I dont have 12k lying around to buy 100 shares, I thought it a good idea to try a PMCC on AAPL.\n\nI'd like to buy the 85C expiring 21Jan 2022, it has a high delta of 87 and is going to cost about $3845.\n\nAccording to Optionsprofitcalculator, if Apple expires at above $124/share it's going to be profitable. Pair this with selling calls, I can't see how this can fail? Unless Apple really gets beaten down from this market selloff, or it plummets for some reason.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, this is my first DD on a stock, so bear with me here. Any feedback is appreciated! I'm an avid investor that has had about half of a year of experience now. I've looked at positive (and negative) indicators on stocks for a while now, but one that has always caught my eye is Apple. Yes, it's a popular stock. Yes, it has had solid returns in general. But why am I so eager about it now, and writing about it? Well, hear me out.\n\n# Why is $AAPL down?\n\nApple's stock has been plummeting lately. It dropped around 0.91% today, and 11.8% this past month. We're seeing a massive sell-off most likely due to the following reasons.\n\n* Little news regarding their future projects. We haven't seen any good indicator of when the planned electric vehicle, VR headset, or other future projects are coming. \n* Apple is reportedly cutting production of popular products. This includes the iPhone 12 mini, discontinuing the iMac Pro, etc. While many news media sources seem to be [unfazed](https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/doesnt-matter-discontinued-imac-pro-3802473/) by the changes, it still can cause a sell-off.\n* The COVID-19 pandemic. We are still stuck at home and eagerly waiting for the vaccine. The market has been performing well, however, given the upcoming stimulus. But the S&amp;P has been a little rocky, and for Apple to move along with it isn't surprising. \n\nThere's more factors to analyze but I don't want to spend hours on this DD. I'm trying to keep it a bit brief -- at least smaller than most DDs on this subreddit.\n\n# What makes me bullish on $AAPL?\n\nI have always loved the company Apple. I use a lot of their products, and I have used them most of my life. It's one of the largest companies. Ever. If you don't see the long-term growth in the company, you are a fool. Just this past year (incl. March 2020), we have seen a 73.28% growth in the stock. Now yes, you may argue that it's just following the rapid bull market we have had during the pandemic, but I would still reflect it on the value of the company as well. They also had a stock split in 2020, so they are definitely on track to have significantly higher growth in the future. \n\nThe RSI of the stock has been low as well. With highs barely scraping 68-70 during this month, and sinking as low as 13, I think this is a strong indicator on how well the stock is bound to perform later this year. Obviously you have to look at the rest of the fundamentals, but to see prices this low for $AAPL in general is insane. Trading volume hasn't been unusual for the company, but yet the price is still dropping. \n\nAs previously written with the uncertainty surrounding upcoming projects, I'm still excited about them.  Mainly Apple's upcoming car project. It has been in the talks for over five years now, but I feel as though we will receive an announcement in the upcoming years (not quite sure about this year). It seems asinine that they're working on a car. But people thought the same with the iPhone back in 2007. Or the Apple Watch in 2015. \"WhY woUld YoU weAr a IpHonE oN yoUr WriSt?\" But yet, it became a massively popular hit in the years to come. So much so, that it [outsold the entire Swiss watch industry in 2019.](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/02/05/apple-watch-outsold-all-of-the-swiss-watch-industry-by-sales-volume-in-2019) But I could totally see Apple make an EV, and become a strong competitor to Tesla during this decade. Apple's VR headset also has been in the news lately, and I could definitely see it be an innovator in gaming. Apple recently released the Apple Arcade for iPhone, Mac, and iPad systems. They are definitely trying to become a leader in the gaming industry. \n\nApple also has started to use their own in-house chips in their new Mac computers. They have pretty much ditched all ties to Intel in their future computers, and I think this is a brilliant idea. The performance on their new machines are stronger than their previous ones, even with similar specs. The machines are also more affordable as well, which makes it even *more* appealing to customers. Apple also has set up a [German chip facility](https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/10/apple-chip-design-5g-munich/) to continue production on new chip innovations. People were eager about 5G innovations with companies like $BB or $NOK, but Apple is working on it as well!\n\n# So what is my game plan?\n\nI plan to YOLO most -- if not all -- of my portfolio into $AAPL. It might seem stupid, but I really do see significant potential in the company for this year. We might see a good catalyst on the rumored March 23rd event, depending on if we have any significant reveals. However, regardless of the outcome of the event, I still feel as though this price point on the company is extremely low and a good buy. \n\nI'll probably hold it for most of 2021, possibly into 2022 if we see any promising news of their upcoming projects. I'll probably post YOLO updates on WSB or something lol. For now, I'm just going to be buying shares, as I've always had theta anxiety with options. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr** I'm extremely bullish on $AAPL and I think their price point right now is incredibly low and a great entry point.\n\nThis is my first DD so please give feedback wherever possible! I want to keep making these, but I want to make sure they aren't pure garbage. Thanks!\n\n(I'm not a financial advisor. Please do your own DD)",

        "selftext": "Hello r/SPACs,\n\nI wanted to share a simple tool with everyone that makes it super easy to follow news on SPACs, stocks, or pretty much anything you'd like.\n\nI often hear of people on this sub asking how people find out news so quickly, and with how quickly the markets move on these things it's easy to feel left behind or late to the party sometimes. I hope this can help change that.\n\nEnter [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts), a service from Google that as soon as their crawling bots pick up on a specified string of text, it will send out an alert to you. Now, we can't all have Bloomberg terminals to get news instantly, but this is a pretty good free alternative.\n\nGoogle usually has it's web crawling bots just waiting for updates from most of the largest media sites out there, so it will usually only be a few seconds or minutes after the content is published that you can receive an alert (depending on how highly the site is ranked and how frequently they publish new content).\n\nSo when you go to the Google Alerts page, you can see there's not much to it:\n\n*Processing img 5dq65k1msjk61...*\n\nSay I want to create an alert to follow the EV company [Canoo](https://www.canoo.com/), whose stock seems to move significantly whenever some decent news drops.\n\nFor instance, on January 12th, an article came out [from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev) confirming what many GOEV investors had been speculating. After that news dropped, it sent the stock soaring 31.9%, and warrants soaring 45.7% to their pre-market highs.\n\nIf you had the alert configured, and it took you 5 minutes to open your brokerage app and place a after-hours trade, you'd still have been able to capture 10-20% of that upside. Or, if you bought after merger and were bagholding, it could have provided you a nice exit price. I hope you can see the power these alerts have the potential to provide.\n\nWhat's nice is you can create Alerts on anything you want:\n\n[When searching for more than one word, put it in quotes so it searches for the phrase not the individual words.](https://preview.redd.it/5sy5et1psjk61.jpg?width=1003&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8069eb77d6f29356dd2ed9bbe5a75c0dd1caa9c5)\n\nThe tool is relatively... minimal, with the configuration options available:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lcedinuvsjk61.jpg?width=988&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7b17d8b407368b3a6493abadea840d9de7ab942\n\nYou can set it to give you either email or RSS updates once a week, day, or the instant the bot crawls it, from whatever source type you choose (blog, news, video etc).\n\nYou can also set it to give you \"only the best results\" from sites Google has determined \"trustworthy\", or \"All Results\" to include posts from Reddit and other social media.\n\nNow, even though your only delivery options are via email or RSS feed, there are third-party solutions to turn that email into something more useful. If you're like me, you certainly don't have your phone configured to provide a notification from every single email you receive.\n\nYou could play around configuring a service like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), which provides the ability to turn those emails into all sorts of notifications, from text messages, to phone calls, to changing the [color of your lightbulbs](https://ifttt.com/hue).\n\nThe easiest solution however, is probably setting up a simple forwarding rule to send the Google Alerts email to your phone as a text message alert:\n\n* AT&amp;T: yournumber@txt.att.net\n* T-Mobile: yournumber@tmomail.net\n* Sprint: yournumber@messaging.sprintpcs.com\n* Verizon: yournumber@vtext.com or phonenumber@vzwpix.com\n* Virgin Mobile: yournumber@vmobl.com\n\nIf you're interested in getting more info on this, [here is a decent guide](https://smith.ai/blog/how-send-email-text-message-and-text-via-email) I found.\n\nAnd that's it!

        "selftext": "I have no idea. But I will tell you how I feel about Dave (aka. El Presidente). The guys an absolute money printer. Having been known for owning \u201ca shit ton of $PENN stock\u201d, he was also one of the founder and CEO of Barstool Sports. He grew that business from basically nothing to the pop culture media giant it is today. While he is no longer CEO, he is Chief of Content where he oversees everything from podcasts and videos, to merchandise and social media presence. Everything this guy touches turns green.\n\nNow that he\u2019s backing this new $BUZZ ETF and will basically be the face of it, I don\u2019t see how this business venture will be any different. It\u2019s debuting today (Thursday, March 4, 2021) on the NYSE.\n\nThe $BUZZ ETF uses artificial intelligence to track the top 75 large-cap stocks each month based on positive social media chatter. The fund will hold stocks with market capitalizations of over $5 billion. Buzz Holdings Founder Jamie Wise said the Buzz Index came about seven years ago when the company launched a research project related to the growing prevalence of online communities and individual investors who were looking for a forum to share and collaborate ideas.\n\n\"The sentiment has always been something that's fascinated me personally,\" Wise said. \"So my thinking at the time was 'Well if more and more people are going to be going online and sharing their investment ideas and empowering themselves to make better investment decisions, there certainly must be some value in that information and wouldn't it be great to understand the collective conversation'.\"\n\nFrom there, Buzz Holdings saw considerable growth in data where the company could measure sentiment based on the social media posts it was observing.\n\nPortnoy said he was approached by Buzz Holdings five years ago after the company's algorithm scraped positive social media chatter around PENN National Gaming. Portnoy noted that Buzz's algorithm, which has been licensed to investment firm VanEck's Vectors Social Sentiment ETF, outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 40% in 2020.\n\nLast year, Penn National paid $163 million for a 36% stake in Portnoy's Barstool Sports. Penn National's sports betting app, is named after Barstool. The deal also calls for Penn National casino sportsbooks around the country to be rebranded \"Barstool\" and in a post-pandemic world, the casinos would feature Barstool\u2019s stars holding pre-game and post-game parties at those sportsbooks whenever major sporting events return to normal for sports fans\n\nCurrently, the top ten holdings in BUZZ include DraftKings, Twitter, Ford, Facebook, Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, Advanced Micro Devices, Netflix and Tesla.\n\nTL;DR - I\u2019m bullish due to Dave\u2019s role in the ETF and based on his previous business ventures.

        "selftext": "So I wrote up a thread on $FSR not too long ago, and got a couple responses that my DD wasn\u2019t really DD, but more an editorial. Since I\u2019m already overly self-critical, I looked back, and yeah, they may have a point. So I decided to go get some receipts. After spending the night huffing paint thinner, I grabbed some receipts (citations in brackets \\[ \\]) and have updated my price targets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: (at the top because I hate when you have to read the whole thing before you even realize there is one)\n\nBull Case : Henrik Fisker is a great car designer that had a run of bad luck, and the partnership with Magna Steyr will give him the manufacturing experience needed to complete a car.\n\nBull Price Target: $14.64 Based on Toyota\u2019s market cap per car produced and Fisker\u2019s 200,000 car production target\n\nBull Odds: 15%\n\nNeutral Case: Henrik Fisker is a great car designer, but doesn\u2019t understand engineering, manufacturing, or production of a car.

The deal with Magna Steyr will fall apart, and they will run out of operating capital without ever delivering a full production run.\n\nBear Price Target: $0\n\nBear Odds 30%\n\n**Combined Updated Price Target: $4.21**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know, I know, you\u2019re sitting there chewing your evening crayons saying, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty harsh there fib, seems like you just have it out for the guy. A car company is more than just one person. You can\u2019t just bash the guy and call it DD.\u201d Well, you may be right, but when there\u2019s no car, no financials (Q4 2020 and FY 2020 results went out as a press release, but 10Q and 10K missing from SEC database), I need to rely on trust in the people running the show. Let me go through how I got to these conclusions and you can see if you agree. I\u2019ll try to avoid too much pop psychology, but man this guy\u2026it\u2019ll be hard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuckle up, this is gonna be looooong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Quick Background: The Early Years**\n\nFisker has a Degree in transportation design from the Art Center College of Design in Switzerland. Rock start vehicle designer with BMW and Aston Martin where he designed the Z8, X5, DB9, and V8 Vantage. \\[1\\]\n\nDesign experience, but doesn\u2019t show any connection to vehicle dynamics, engineering, or manufacturing.\n\nDoes some work with/for Tesla back in 2007. Gets sued for allegedly only taking the job to steal confidential information to be able to start his own company \u2013 Fisker Automotive. Fisker wins in arbitration, with a finding that he did nothing wrong. \\[1\\] I mention this not to throw shade (he won the arbitration after all), just to introduce his connection to Elon Musk and Tesla. This connection seems an unavoidable thread through his work at Fisker Automotive which would have directly competed with Tesla.\n\n**Chapter 1: Fisker Automotive (the first one)**\n\nHenrik Fisker created his first car company. Named it after himself (not a glaring red flag since it\u2019s his first company, but remember this for later). Created a car \u2013 the Fisker Karma \u2013 that was beautiful, but an engineering disaster. \n\nThe most publicized issue was batteries that would catch on fire. But this wasn\u2019t the only problem. \u201cPressure on engineers to stay faithful to Henrik Fisker\u2019s original design, even when flaws emerged that undercut the Karma\u2019s performance and potential fixes would add millions in cost.\u201d \\[2\\]. These flaws included an exhaust system for the hybrid ICE that pointed forwards. The Exhaust. Pointed. Forward. And Fisker wouldn\u2019t let anyone change it.\n\n\u201cOn more than one occasion, Fisker asked suppliers to hand-build certain components for the Karma, which increased the cost as much as threefold\u201d \\[2\\]\n\n\u201cThe company churned through three battery suppliers in three years. As PrivCo notes in this amazing timeline, Fisker established a pattern of awarding supply contracts \u2018not necessarily to the best supplier, or the supplier who offers the best price\u2026but rather to companies that were owners and investors in Fisker.\u2019\u201d \\[3\\]\n\n\u201cAs the years rolled by, Fisker observers became increasingly suspicious that the company didn\u2019t even possess a working car. At the 2008 debut, Fisker announced that the Karma would go on sale in late 2009. Yet by early 2010, when Bill Gifford profiled the company for Popular Science, no one but the chauffeur for the Crown Prince of Denmark had driven even an early prototype.\u201d \\[3\\]\n\n\u201c\u2019Beneath the world-class skin was a rudimentary machine that needed several years of engineering refinement and testing before it could be ready to be released,\u2019 said Maurice Gunderson, a managing partner at Runway Capital Partners who had an opportunity to invest in Fisker in early 2010 and passed.\u201d \\[2\\]\n\n\u201cFrom 2008 to 2012, the carmaker lost an estimated $1 billion.\u201d \\[2\\] (currently FSR claims $991m cash on hand and a planned production start at the end of 2023). \n\nThis was heavily scrutinized after the fact since they had taken a $529M loan from the US Department of Energy and faced a congressional hearing in 2013. He left the company, and it soon after closed up shop and was liquidated and bought by a Chinese company. The same company that made the batteries for the Karma, that were catching fire. That\u2019s got to hurt.\n\nSo, man that\u2019s a rough start. Maybe he learned a bunch of lessons (best lessons are learned by making mistakes you know). Maybe he came back stronger, smarter, and better. Let\u2019s see\u2026\n\n**Interlude: VLF Force 1 (2016)**\n\nHis next related venture after getting out of Fisker Automotive was a collaboration with some buddies to make a bespoke supercar called the VLF Force 1. His buddies had a company, VL Automotive, and they were like, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if you \\[Fisker\\] could design a car for us. Fisker was like cool, since were friends and all. You might notice the difference between the name of the company and the name of the car. VL\u2026VLF\u2026VL\u2026VLF. Yes, he made them change the name to add the \u201cF\u201d for Fisker before he agreed to help (two is a pattern). \\[4\\]\n\nAs promotion for this, he gave an interview where he answered a couple questions about the downfall of Fisker Automotive. \\[4\\]\n\nQ: So what really happened at the end of Fisker Automotive?\n\nA: I had major disagreements with the management on strategy, and I resigned in March 2013. Shortly after, the company eventually filed for voluntary bankruptcy in November 2013.\n\nQ: You were the Chairman not the CEO then. How was the decision made to wind up the company?\n\nA: After I left, Fisker Automotive went on for a few months. They filed for voluntary bankruptcy and restructuring in November 2013. In February 2014, a judge carried out a public and structured auction of the assets of Fisker Automotive, the winners being a large parts supplier in China called Wanxiang.\n\nIt\u2019s a short back and forth, but there\u2019s a lot in there to unpack. I just don\u2019t have the time or the psychology degree to piece through it. Suffice to say, it really doesn\u2019t sound to me like a man who learned any lessons or is taking any responsibility for the failure. \n\nAlso relating to the VLF Force 1 is the first mention of him taking control of design and production of the battery systems. \n\n\u201cWe have formed a joint venture with Nanotech to create Fisker Nanotech that is developing a ground-breaking battery where we are testing the use of Graphene along with Lithium ion. It is showing some amazing possibilities. It will have, for sure, the world\u2019s longest range. We have a good chance of passing 400 miles \\[on a single charge\\]. Plus we can charge it much faster and it has a longer life.\u201d \\[4\\]. \n\nWait, 400 mile range! In 2016! This should have been groundbreaking. But alas, it was vaporware. \n\nHe also shows his deep lack of understanding of car manufacturing and design in the same interview. After owning a car company for four years.\n\n\u201cWe also ended up changing the rear end, to accommodate the exhaust pipes. And, of course, we had to put the driveshaft down through the centre. In the beginning I think everybody thought that\u2019s pretty easy. But it ended up taking several years and millions of dollars.\u201d \\[4\\]\n\nHe also mentions a second car, the VLF Destino, that would be a high volume, low cost car. However this is the first of what I\u2019ll refer to his \u201cvaporcars\u201d. \n\n**Chapter 3: Return of the Fisker (Inc.)** \n\nFisker eventually got the rights to his name back and started a third company named after himself, Fisker Inc. We\u2019re going to go through a lot here, but pay attention to dates. \n\nIn 2017 Fisker unveils the Fisker Emotion (this will become vaporcar 2). Claimed modest specs like a 400 mile range \\[5\\], Level 4 autonomous drive \\[6\\], and a solid state battery \\[6\\]. Said that production would start in 2020 \\[6\\]. Again, any single one of these specs coming out in a car released TODAY would be game changing. But he claimed to have them ready to go in 2017. \n\nSo lets talk about that battery. A solid state battery is the holy grail right now for car manufacturers. Read up on $QS if you want more details, but basically no one has made it work in an EV. Fisker claimed the following in an interview in 2017:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly been dismissed for automotive because it\u2019s very expensive to make, it doesn\u2019t have the power, and it doesn\u2019t work below zero,\u201d said Fisker. \u201cWe have cracked all three of these areas.\u201d \\[5\\]\n\nIn a vehicle like the EMotion, it could easily permit a 700-mile range, he said. \\[5\\]\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a lab test; we\u2019ve actually built the batteries,\u201d \\[5\\]\n\nThey had hired a man named Fabio Albano from a company called Sakti3 who made a lot of bold claims about solid state batteries, but according to the following:\n\n\u201cTo date \\[1/18/2018\\], none of the companies involved\u2014Dyson, Fisker, or the former Sakti3, which is now a subsidiary of Dyson\u2014have demonstrated a working, full-size automotive solid-state battery prototype and the most Fisker has shown the public is a block of material from a supposed solid-state battery.\u201d \\[7\\]\n\nFrom the same article: \u201cBut it's Fisker's insistence its solid-state battery technology works, the secrecy around it, and how much the company is reliant on it coming to fruition that calls into question the entire company, not just the car.\u201d \\[7\\]\n\nBack to the cars. The Fisker Orbit (vaporcar 3) was announced in 2018 as another very pretty drawing. \u201cFor now, the Orbit is being kept under wraps, but Fisker is hoping to bring the actual vehicles out into the world for a pilot at the end of 2019. \u201cWe are looking to start driving that around and testing it on a campus in the second half of next year.\u201d He shared that the pilot would not be, as I expected, in China, but instead would be deployed at a campus in the United States.\u201d \\[8\\]\n\nBy 2019, Fisker had apparently moved vaporcar 2 and vaporcar 3 to the back burner and was pushing his SUV for the masses (eventually to become the Ocean). He announced they would have a driveable prototype of the SUV by the end of the year (2019) \\[10\\], and were tooling up their own factory for production \\[9\\]. \n\n2020 was a big year where they went public, and secured a manufacturing deal with Magna. With Magna able to engineer and manufacture an entire vehicle, maybe things are looking up?\n\n**Chapter 4: Foxconn**\n\nFile this under, OH GOD WHY?!?! You have a manufacturer. That does reputable work for reputable car companies. Why would you announce partnering with a second manufacturer, who specializes in cell phones, who has a reputation for valuing PR over production, and has never mass produced anything larger than a tablet!? Foxconn is the apparent manufacturer of the yet to be unveiled \u201cPear\u201d concept. The Pear also exists only as a drawing on a napkin (vapor-ish car 4). Will Magnus allow you to take their design and components to a competitor for manufacturing, or do you plan to start all over from the ground up? Does Foxconn even know how to build a car? Do they have sourcing relationships for the car parts? Do they have anything to offer other than whispers of \u201cApple\u201d in the press? This truly baffles me. \n\n**Chapter 5: I\u2019m Exhausted**\n\nI\u2019m so tired of writing this, I\u2019d be amazed if anyone reads it all the way through. I just want to briefly mention the current leadership of the company. Fisker Inc. has Henrik\u2019s wife as CFO. This is a huge red flag for me when there\u2019s an external relationship between the CEO and the CFO. Many shenanigans can ensue. The board also is full of lawyers and bankers (again), not people with auto industry experience. The one leadership position that has auto industry experience is the Chief Technology Officer (who is not a board member). \n\n**Chapter 6: Industry Saturation**\n\nI think if he is able to strengthen ties with Magnus, and they can rope him into building a practical car, they may get the Ocean out to consumers. However, it will be too late. As I mentioned in my first write up, the EV market is already nearing saturation (see Tesla\u2019s declining sales numbers), and the big boys (GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes) are still yet to fully enter the game. And the Ocean is also (optimistically) 3 years away. People will not wait that long. They will cancel their $250 reservations and buy a car that\u2019s at the lot down the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so is Henrik going to be successful? I doubt it. He seems to have learned nothing from his past experiences and has a track record of inflated promises, poor decision making, unrealistic timelines, and not being able to deliver. The sum of all these parts to me shows a portrait of a company that will not be anything but another extension of his ego. They seem to not even be designing the car (Magnus is), and I can\u2019t decide what value they add other than the name on the front. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always, these are my personal thoughts for entertainment purposes only and are not intended as trading advice.

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been living in Korea for the past \\~2 years (and am Korean-American) and over the past few months have been using Coupang to order products and food. I was mainly using it as part of my due diligence for the upcoming IPO but now I\u2019m a loyal customer. Here\u2019s my DD on what\u2019s known as the \u201cAmazon of Korea\u201d (which I think is a well-justified title).\n\nAll information + data is from the [company\u2019s latest S-1 filing](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021004212?cik=1834584) \\+ from my own experiences. Company is set to IPO this week (latest [report](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/coupang-ipo-when-will-coupang-go-public-what-is-the-cpng-price-range/) I saw was Thursday, 3/11/21)\n\n**A Brief History of Coupang**\n\n* Coupang was founded in 2010 by Bom Kim, a Harvard business school dropout\n* The company started off as a daily-deal Groupon type business but pivoted into an EBay-style third party marketplace that reached over $1 billion in sales within 3 years\n* Coupang almost went public with that business model but decided to pull out of the IPO because Bom felt like Coupang was one that customers *liked* but not one they\u00a0*loved*\u00a0(pretty ballsy move imo)\n* As a result, Coupang completely reinvented itself into an end-to-end eCommerce company and\u00a0with the help of a $2 billion investment from Softbank in 2018, the company has now become a dominant force in Korea\n\n**What Does Coupang Do?**\n\n* Let me first set the stage by providing the 3 key values that drive everything that Coupang does: **service, selection, and price.**\u00a0These values pervade all of Coupang\u2019s business divisions, and I\u2019ll be discussing the company within the framework of these 3 values.\n* **First off is in my opinion the most impressive, and that is the company\u2019s service**\n   * What separates Coupang from its competitors in Korea is that the company has invested billions of dollars in **both technology and infrastructure** **to own the entire customer experience** from desktop to delivery\n      * This is in contrast to some of the company\u2019s competitors like GMarket and Naver which mainly offers a platform for merchants to sell items\n      * Competitors are quickly adapting to Coupang\u2019s business model but as of now, Coupang\u2019s model combined with its scale is unique in Korea\n   * The company owns the **largest logistics footprint in the country with 70% of the population living with 7 miles** of a Coupang logistics center\n   * This allows the company to offer the **fastest delivery service in the country through Rocket Delivery** which offers the following services:\n      * First, millions of items are available for either **same day delivery** if ordered in the morning or **Dawn delivery,** which delivers products to you by 7AM if you order by midnight\n      * Second, **nearly 100% of orders are delivered either by the next day or faster**\u00a0365 days a year even before\u00a0holidays like Christmas\n      * Third,\u00a0the company has been able to **eliminate cardboard boxes in over 75% of its orders** which saves the\u00a0company both costs and in storage space\n      * Fourth are **frictionless returns.**\u00a0Instead of having to drop off your items, you simply leave them outside your door and initiate a return on the app which is super convenient\n* **The second value to discuss for Coupang is selection, which I\u2019ve also found to be very impressive**\n   * Put simply, Coupang\u00a0offers **more items than any other Ecommerce player in Korea** both for products and for groceries\n      * I\u2019ve personally ordered a range of items from Coupang like pens, strawberries, and tape but you can also buy things like TVs, clothes, and Apple products\n* **The third last but not least important value is price**\n   * First of all, Coupang offers all of the great services like Rocket Delivery and same day shipping through its **Wow Membership (akin to Amazon Prime) for an insanely low rate of 2900 won a month which roughly equates to $2.50**\n   * Second, the company is **constantly offering deals for products** even for things like cell phones and Apple products\n   * Coupang\u2019s **goal is to offer the lowest possible prices** to customers and the scary thing is that as the company scales, its competitive advantage on this front will grow more and more\n* **Other business divisions**\n   * Coupang Eats is basically like UberEats and Doordash and it\u2019s a separate app where you can order food\n      * I get ads for Coupang all the time and from speaking with my Korean friends, it sounds like this is one area where Coupang has a lot of mindshare amongst customers but faces a lot of stiff competition compared to its dominance in eCommerce\n      * As an investor, it\u2019ll be important to see if this part of the business has a path to profitability and is gaining market share or is just bleeding money since margins are likely very slim\n   * Merchant Services, which is similar to fulfillment by Amazon. Merchants can send their items to Coupang fulfillment centers so that they don\u2019t need to handle inventory themselves\n      * Merchants can also pay to advertise on Coupang which is another revenue driver for the company\n   * Coupang Play is a streaming service\n   * Coupang Travel which is like a Kayak or Expedia and offers travel deals\n   * There\u2019s even more the company is working on, but basically what you need to know is that Coupang has a lot of potential growth beyond just eCommerce\n\n**The Korean Market**\n\n* I wanted to provide some context about Korea itself from having lived here the past 2 years that is relevant to Coupang\n   * **First off, Korea is incredibly tech savvy**\n      * There\u2019s free wifi everywhere even on buses and basically everyone in the country has a smartphone including my grandma\n      * As a small example, Koreans were using their smartphones to pay many, many years before Apple Pay even existed\n      * This is obviously important for Coupang because all orders come from online\n   * **Second, as a baseline, Koreans work incredibly hard**\n      * Korea was a 3rd world country after the Korean War in the 1950s and since then has become the 4th largest economy in Asia and 12th in the world\n      * A lot of Korean students literally study from 8am to midnight from elementary school to high school and a lot of my friends who work in corporate work super long hours even without great pay\n      * I bring this up to say that Coupang is constantly employing a workforce that from a general perspective has an incredibly high work ethic\n   * **The third is that because Korea\u2019s land is so small, cities are incredibly dense**\n      * This is what allows for Coupang to operate so efficiently and probably much moreso than is possible in bigger countries like China and the US\n* **Addressable Market**\n   * As of 2019, Korea\u2019s eCommerce market was **$128 billion** and that\u2019s expected to grow to **$206 billion by 2024,**\u00a0which represents a 10% annual growth rate\n   * In addition to that, eCommerce spend on a per buyer basis is expected to grow from **$2600** in 2019 to **$4300** in 2024\n   * These numbers are great, but what\u2019s really astonishing is that even with Coupang\u2019s massive scale, it currently **only owns about a 4% market share,** which means the company has a lot of room to grow\n\n**The Bull Case**\n\n* **First, let\u2019s talk about the company\u2019s scale**\n   * In the entire country, Coupang is the largest e-commerce player, has the fastest delivery service, owns the largest logistics footprint with over 100 centers across 30 cities, provides the largest selection of products, and largest fleet of drivers with over 15,000 employed\n   * Coupang was able to grow to its scale today after raising **$3.4 billion, 3 of which came from Softbank,** which has the largest fund in the world and it\u2019s going to be hard for another competitor to come in with that kind of funding (though it is possible)\n* **Second is Coupang\u2019s tech because at the end of the day, Coupang is actually a technology and logistics company**\n   * All that money from Softbank didn\u2019t go only into capital expenditures but also a really sophisticated tech infrastructure that predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for every order\n   * Each order shifts through 100s of millions of options for inventory, processing, and delivery options all within seconds\n* **Third is an extremely loyal and growing customer base**\n   * Some tech companies provide something called cohort math which is where you see how the same group of people have increased or decreased their spending of a company\u2019s products over time\n   * If you take a look at this [table](https://content.bamsec.com/0001628280-21-004212/cohort11a.jpg), 2016 customers took 5 years to triple their spending, while it took 2017 customers 4 years, and 2018 customers only 3 years\n      * From using Coupang myself, I can totally see why this is the case. I went from ordering from multiple sites to pretty much only using Coupang now because it\u2019s so convenient\n* **Fourth is the company\u2019s management team**\n   * Bom Kim (CEO) - The company is founder-led, which I think is usually a good thing because they know the ins and outs of the business\n   * Thuan Pham (CTO) - Former CTO of Uber (really great hire since Coupang is a logistics company)\n   * Gaurav Anand (CFO) - Lots of finance experience from Flipkart and Amazon\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\n* **First off, the company is unprofitable and may continue to invest in new businesses that could cause severe losses just as when Uber tried to enter China**\n   * The company points out as a risk factor in its S-1 that it may expand into other countries and I would pay really close\u00a0attention to this since this could take away the company\u2019s focus and cause losses\n* **Second is the lack of shareholder voting rights**\n   * Coupang\u2019s CEO Bom Kim owns about **77% of the company\u2019s voting rights** and also acts as Chairman of the board, so this guy has a ton of influence over the company\n   * If Bom Kim starts underperforming for whatever reason or there\u2019s some kind of scandal (abnormally frequent in Korea where there\u2019s a lot of bribery and fraud), this could be something to watch out for\n* **Third is Coupang\u2019s valuation**\n   * As with most IPOs, there will likely be a frenzy and the company\u2019s valuation could get stretched very quickly, so this is just something to watch out for\n   * At the top end of its range of $34 per share, the company\u2019s valuation will be at about $58BN  \n\n      * With LTM sales of \\~$12BN, the company\u2019s EV / LTM Sales multiple will by 4.8x (which actually would be a good price in my opinion)\n   * BUT, there will likely be a pop and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if shares reach $100, giving the company a \\~$100BN valuation and that\u2019s where valuation will be a bit stretched (though long term, still may be okay)\n      * Will be posting more about Coupang\u2019s valuation after its IPO\n* **Fourth, is competition which is a potential issue even for Coupang**\n   * In November 2020, Amazon invested a 30% stake in competitor 11Street, which is majority owned by SK Telecom which is one of the largest\u00a0companies in Korea\n   * The industry Coupang competes in is very lucrative market so there will always be some stiff competition with deep pockets\n   * I do plan to make another post in the future about Coupang after interviewing my Korean friends some more and will include a competitive landscape analysis when I do\n\n**Financial Overview**\n\n* **Revenue**\n   * From 2019 to 2020, Coupang\u2019s revenue grew from $6.3BN to $12BN, **nearly a 100% increase** (COVID did have a factor in this so can\u2019t expect a similar growth rate moving forward)\n      * Coupang has been able to grow its quarterly revenue from $0.8 billion in Quarter 1 of 2018 to $3.8 billion in Q4 2020\n      * This was driven by a 27% annual increase in number of customers from **9.2 million to 14.8 million** from 2018 to 2020\n      * There was also a 42% annual increase in spend per active customer from $127 to $256 from 2018 to 2020\n* **Margins**\n   * As the\u00a0company has scaled, it has been able to improve its **gross margins from 4.7% to 16.6%** from 2018 to 2020\n   * Coupang also increased its **EBITDA margin from negative 24% to negative 2%** from 2018 to 2020\n      * Due to the increase in the company\u2019s scale, the company is spending less on\u00a0operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and what\u2019s most fascinating to me is that Coupang **only spent 1% of its revenue on marketing in 2020**\n* **Cash Flow Statement**\n   * Company actually posted positive operating cash flow of $300 million (not much) but still, means the company\u2019s core business is not losing money\n   * With negative $484 million in capital expenditures, the company has negative free cash flow of \\~$180 million but that\u2019s essentially breakeven for a $11 billion revenue business\n* **Balance Sheet**\n   * Won\u2019t go into this much because balance sheet will look very different after IPO\n   * But, the company has $1.2BN in cash and around $1.1BN in debt. Company is raising around $4BN in cash from the IPO so balance sheet is healthy\n\n**TLDR:** Coupang is the Amazon of Korea. Growing like crazy and at the right valuation, a great way to get exposure to the South Korean eCommerce market which has a lot of tailwinds. Personally from using the service myself over the past few months, I don't see the need to use basically any other eCommerce platform for products or groceries. IPO reported to be this week on Thursday so good one to watch for.",

        "selftext": "Highlights from Tuesday\u2019s trading session\n\n* Big Tech Rebounds\n* Tesla has best day since April 2020, surges 20%\n* All eyes on Robolux IPO\n* Biden to sign stimulus bill before Sunday deadline\n\n# Tuesday Market Recap\n\n* Big Tech Rebounds\n\nAfter lagging badly for the last few weeks, tech stocks are exploding higher as bond yields stabilized. The Nasdaq Composite finished upwards 3.69% to 13,073.82 for its best day since November. The tech-heavy benchmark rallied as much as 4.3% during the session. Apple and Facebook jumped more than 4% each, while Microsoft and Netflix both gained at least 2.5%. Amazon rose 3.8%.\n\nThe contrast between the gains of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks emphasizes market participant\u2019s increasing rotation out of tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are likely going to benefit from the economy reopening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Yields\n\nYield's pulled back a little but remain at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Tesla has best day since April, soars 20%\n\nTesla soared 19.6% after a five-day losing streak and posted its biggest one-day pop since February 2020. This is the stocks best trading day since April 2020 though the stock is still down about 25% from its all-time intraday high of $900 per share on January 25.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* All eyes on Robolux IPO\n\nThe company is scheduled to go public through a direct listing on Wednesday, after raising money in January at a $29.5 billion valuation. The company has built one of the top-grossing apps for\u00a0Apple\u00a0and\u00a0Google\u00a0devices by turning youthful users into game creators without forcing them to learn complicated coding. Roblox said in the latest update to its\u00a0prospectus\u00a0that it paid developers $328.7 million last year, up almost 200% from 2019. That far outpaced the company\u2019s sales growth of 82% last year, when it booked $923.9 million in total revenue\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Biden to Sign stimulus bill before Sunday deadline\n\nIt is no longer news that House Democrats plan to pass the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package on Wednesday morning. However, the issue is getting it across to Biden to sign before Sunday. Biden aims to sign the legislation in time to beat a Sunday deadline to renew unemployment aid programs. It can take days for Congress to formally send huge bills to the White House. The president previously said he expects direct payments of up to $1,400 to start hitting Americans\u2019 bank accounts this month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Gamestop (GME) performed strongly again today, rising around 26%! To Da Moon we go!\n* Roblox is set to go public tomorrow via direct listing, ticker will be RBLX. Unlike a traditional IPO the company isn\u2019t raising new capital via the offering, instead holders are selling stock they already own.\n* Walt Disney Co.'s flagship streaming service, Disney+, has surpassed 100 million subscribers in its first 16 months of operation, the company announced today.\n* After cratering in value in recent weeks, EV stocks like NIO and Tesla (TSLA) came roaring back today! It was Tesla\u2019s best day since 2013, up around 19% at the time of writing\n* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) boss Jack Dorsey said on Tuesday he will convert proceeds from the digital auction of the first-ever tweet on the platform to bitcoin for charity. His first tweet sold as a non-fungible token for $2.5 million\n\nIs this recap helpful?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/m1jmtz)",

        "selftext": "Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. \n\nOver the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden\u2019s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. \n\nThe prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today\u2019s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. \n\nHighlights\nThe ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.\n\nShares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.\n\nShares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.\n\nRoblox's IPO is set to take place on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol \"RBLX.\" \n\n*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning premarket and does not reflect intraday movement*\n \n\nAccenture (ACN) target raised by Susquehanna from $267 to $290 at Positive.

        "selftext": "I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.\n\nYou guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.\n\nI am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population. Instead of going to war for oil now we are spreading peace for likes.",
