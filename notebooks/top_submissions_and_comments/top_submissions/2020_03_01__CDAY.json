Most of these still aren\u2019t at 52 week lows so my advice would be 4/17 or 5/15 puts about 25% below the stocks price. \n\nThere are still a lot of room for stuff to fall. The entire world is shutdown and realistically companies will be lucky if they do 10-20% of the business they expected to do...that\u2019s an 80% drop in business...but most these aren\u2019t down near that much. \n\nGood luck assfuckers",
