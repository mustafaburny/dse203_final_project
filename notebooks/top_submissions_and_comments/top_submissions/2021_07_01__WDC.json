        "selftext": "so micron has a record ER, and guides higher but the market dumps.\n\nAnyone who has held Micron who a couple years knows this story. \n\nFor those who lost their ass on weeklies - this is why I say dont do weeklies on micron. \n\nWhy is it dumping? Partially because of people getting margin called and closing out their weeklies. STOP DOING IT. \n\nSo anyway on to the report:\n\n[https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e](https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e)\n\n \u25aa Expect CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth to be somewhat above 20%, with DRAM industry supply below demand; there is currently unmet demand for DRAM due to end market strength and we expect the DRAM market to remain tight into CY-22 \n\n\u25aa Expect CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the mid 30% range, with NAND supply below demand; we also see the NAND market as tight into CY-22 \n\n\u25aa Long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens \n\n\u25aa Long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30% Micron \n\n\u25aa Targeting to align our long-term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND \n\n\u25aa CY-21 DRAM and NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth \n\n\u25aa Placed orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of long-term agreement \n\n\u25aa FY21 Capex revised to somewhat above $9.5 bn; mostly from areas that don\u2019t impact CY21 and CY22 bit growth such as EUV pre-payments, construction spending and other R&amp;D and corporate items \n\nNow during the call, analysts seemed to really dig in deep into Sanjays comments re purchasers shifting from \"just in time\" models to \"just in case\" models. They think this indicates previous purchases were above actual consumption and intended to raise inventory. As such they expect weakening demand and pricing moving forward. \n\nI disagree with their fears. Sanjay guides in a way so that he can smash at ER. He has done this for Micron and he has done with Sandisk before they got bought out at WDC. Have a look at previous earnings and whether they beat or not. \n\nexpand table to see more dates on links below\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\\_earnings.php?q=sndk](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q=sndk) (Sanjay for all of it)\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\\_earnings.php?sort=earning\\_date&amp;q=mu](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?sort=earning_date&amp;q=mu) (Sanjay from Q3 2017)\n\nSanjay knows markets dont like surprise, so he guides low. Hes also been in Semi industry forever. Hes not an idiot. So when he says guidance is X, I take guidance to be X + extra for the beat. I dont freaking think I need to discount the guidance because purchasers increasing inventory. Sanjay has priced that shit in. \n\nSo thats inventory and guidance. \n\nWhat about the sale to Texas Instruments? Thats not linked to RAM or NAND really. Kinda but not really. Thats them giving up on (3dx point) Intel Octane. There was no market for it so keeping the plant was costing them 500 mil a year since it was under-utilised. However they kept all the IP from Octane in case it comes back to life later on. Its basically non volatile RAM which can be used as storage - sounds really cool but  I am guessing its expensive AF so people dont want it yet. Again, selling this plant is basically good for micron. We want higher margins to run a slick operation. \n\nI dont really like toms hardware but this article explains the sale the best. Other news stories on it say there was a sale but doesnt really tell you much about about the background.\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million)\n\nWhat is driving increasing margin? Well Micron is using DUV (deep ultra violet) with computational lithography and multiple masks to achieve smaller resolution on DRAM. Samsung are achieving same resolution with EUV. EUV costs a bunch and ASML are the only supplier. You should probably get into ASML at some point as well WSB but thats a post for another day. As such, Microns margins for latest tech DRAM is way lower than Samsung. SK Hynix is the third player in RAM and they are playing catchup - seem a bit fucked to me personally. Nanya is the 4th player and realllllly small and think they are just screwed. Dont have the money to get into EUV so next few generations, they will be so far behind they just get bought out if any competition regulatory body allows it (at near bankruptcy stage is my guess). \n\nNow Micron is starting to invest in EUV which is good and they have given themselves a lead time for 2 years which feels about right to me. In 2023 we will see if they are still at cutting edge of RAM vs Samsung who will have a 2 year head start into EUV production. This is the only concern to me. In this time, they will gain the benefit of reduced pricing for EUV tech and additional expertise from ASML who will be helping Micron to achieve results. I am hoping they can transplant their specialist know how from DUV to EUV (that everyone else didnt manage to do at this resolution), but at this stage, my science ability is woefully unable to track it meaningfully.\n\nLets look at Microns plan for EUV and the interim releases until then.  \n\n[https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/)\n\nSo you can see we are currently at 1 alpha node for 10nm in 2021. We have 1 beta and 1 gamma to go planned (still using DUV) before 1 delta which is when EUV should kick in. Thats a new node every year still using DUV. Thats sweet if it works out. In the interim Micron gets to print money like nobodys business (higher margin from DUV) and continue hiring R&amp;D people with EUV knowledge from Korea and Japan. \n\nI have a small long position in micron. I dont really care about short term price movements. I expect this to be higher in 3 to 6 months. Thats what I care about. I expect it to be higher in 12 months. Beyond that I want to see how their 1 beta and 1 gamma nodes are coming along with updates as to 1 delta using EUV. \n\nWe are trading at price levels from Jan/Feb this year. We have had 2 great ERs since then. I dont see TAM in RAM or NAND dropping any time soon or pricing (thesis of tacit collusion as to supply/pricing in oligopolies - we arent cyclical market anymore because 3 market players control like 98% of the DRAM production in the world - its why they are not dumping on capex - its intentional). \n\nthis is good price to buy, but dont expect results in a week or even a month. We might trade sideways for a while. Shake out the paper hands before funds buy back in at discount and ramp up for next ER. You cant time the ramp up, you just have to be in the stock at a decent price (like now) and then wait for it to happen.",

        "selftext": "I was holding call positions on $MU through May-June like a good ape \ud83e\udd8d. Here\u2019s why I switched to puts.  \n  \nDRAM won\u2019t be in short supply for long and smart money knows it. This means the prices for DRAM (which make up 70% of $MU\u2019s revenue) aren\u2019t going to continue increasing. \nIn fact\u2026 they\u2019ll likely peak October then start dropping.  \n  \n**Reason #1:**  \nNow my fellow apes may ask\u2026 \u201cbut peaceinpieces, Bloomberg articles tell me semiconductors are in a huge shortage\u201d. \nSure that\u2019s true as blanket statement, but let\u2019s peal the eggplant \ud83c\udf46 shall we?   \n  \nWhat\u2019s holding up the production of PC, Mobile handset, and servers isn\u2019t DRAM!\nThey\u2019re short on everything else: semiconductors like display, analog power ICs, CPUs, Networking chips, etc.  \n  \nIn fact many large customers have surplus DRAM (most notably mobile phone makers).\nWhy? Because they\u2019ve been buying DRAM while unable to get ahold of other necessary components.  \n  \n**Reason #2**  \nIndustry experts already knew earnings were going to be great. It\u2019s been priced in since May.  \n  \nWhat they were looking for in the earnings call was for Micron to swing their big dick onto the table and proclaim: \u201cDRAMs short in 2022 retards! We\u2019re going to the moon \ud83d\ude80\u201d.  \n  \nInstead they got lukewarm piss: \u201cWe see DRAM ASPs increasing through 2H\u201d.  \nTo which most analysts thought, \u201cNo shit, holiday season bruh.\u201d  \nMicron showed no confidence.  \n  \n**TLDR: I spent my time typing, so go read you ape \ud83e\udd8d . This market insight is being provided as a public service.**  \n  \n**Side note, I\u2019m still long $WDC and holding my calls and adding more for October. Pending KIOXIA\u2019s IPO in Japan, $WDC is undervalued at $20B. **",

September will bring a correction.

That is NAND storage \"memory\". The vast majority of all electronics now use NAND storage (phones, PCs, gaming, servers, cars, cameras, etc.)\n\n**HDDs are a slower form of storage**, and although the technology is dated... it is very cheap on a $/GB basis.
