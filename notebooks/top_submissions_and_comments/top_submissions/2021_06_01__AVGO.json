        "selftext": "When it comes to boring strategies, Out-Of-The-Money Bullish Put Spreads are pretty much at the top of the list.  They are rarely used, but if done correctly almost always profitable.\n\n**Concept:** You are selling a put and buying a put on a stock on the same expiration, different strikes.  \n\n*Example:* A stock is at $100, and you sold the 90 puts and bought the 85 puts, thus you would receive a credit.  The reason is - you get more money from selling the 90 puts, than it cost buying the 85 puts.  In this case, if your received $3 selling the 90 put, and spent $2 buying the 85 puts, you would get a $1 credit.  Your best case scenario is that the stock stays above the short put (in this example, 90) at expiration and both puts expire worthless.  When that happens you keep the credit of $1 (aka - $100).  Worst case is the stock finishes below the long put at $85 (e.g. finishes at $84) in which case you are out the distance between the strikes (90-85=5) minus your credit (so $5-$1=$4).  Obviously since your risk ($4 = $400 per contract) is much higher than your potential reward ($1 = $100 per contract), these spreads need to be successful a high percentage of the time.  \n\nIf done properly, they are.  \n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on doing a profitable OTM BPS, with an example you can use on Monday (6/7/2021).\n\n**Step 1:** The first thing you want to do is find the right stock. You want:\n\n*A) Stock is over $20 a share - under this price and the volatility is usually too high.*\n\n*B) Stock has already had earnings or the next earnings announcement is further out than your spread will cover.  You do not want to hold an OTM BPS over earnings. Ever.*\n\n*C) Stock is in a bullish pattern and above most of it's major SMA's (50,100, 200).*\n\n*D) Stock is relatively strong to the market.  Meaning that over the past week or two you can see that even when the market dipped, the stock held its value or continued to go higher. This not only indicates a strong stock, but also adds protection in case of a sustained market drop.*\n\n***Doing a quick search and I found a candidate - AVGO.***  \n\n*It is currently above it's 50 and 100 SMA, already had earnings, and since it gapped up on 5/20 it not only held the gap and moved higher, but managed to stay strong even during days the market was down.*\n\n**Step 2:**  Since the risk on these spreads are high, you want to lower that risk as much as possible.  There are two ways to do this:\n\n*A) The farther out of the money you go, the less likely it is that the stock will drop below your strike prices - however, if you go out too far you won't receive enough credit.*\n\nI tend to go at least two standard deviations (putting me on the 2.5% tail of the stocks price movements).  I also like to have several barriers of support above my short strike. Being that far out and with that many layers of support means the stock would have to have a major technical breakdown in order for my spread to be in danger.\n\n*B) The higher the credit received, the lower your win rate needs to be for this strategy to be profitable.* \n\nAs a general rule, I like to receive 20 cents credit to every dollar between the strike prices.  So for a $5 spread difference, I look for $1 credit.  A 50 cent difference in the spread, I look for a 10 cent credit.  This gives me a 25% ROI on my investment.  If the spread is $90/$85, I am getting $1 credit and risking $4.  Each contract would require $400 in margin to cover that risk.  (*personally, I always look to get $1,000 per BPS, so if I am getting a $1 credit, I will do 10 contracts.  Risking $4,000 for the $1,000).*  However, I will also explain why you are not really risking the 75% either.  Still, with this desired credit as a rule, I need to be successful more than 75% of the time in order for this strategy to pay off.\n\n**For AVGO the $445/$440 strikes meet this criteria.  Above $445 strike is the 50 and 100 SMA's, horizontal support as well as a $3 gap that would need to be filled before my short strike was in any danger.  If by chance that occurs, the spread can still be profitable (more on that in a bit).**\n\n**Step 3:** I want an expiration as close as possible that gives me the desired credit.  In this case the June 25th expiration, gives me a $1.50 credit for selling the $445 puts (I would get $3.50 credit) and buying the $440 puts (currently cost $2.00).  Chances are on Monday that credit will be lower, but I am putting the order in for a $1.25 credit. That would be a 33.3% ROI over 2 1/2 weeks time.  Given how far out my strikes are, and how many layers of support are above it, my likelihood of success is going to be far greater than 66.6%.\n\nSo now I have my trade: **AVGO - Selling the $445 Puts/Buying the $440 Puts for the 6/25 Expiration and getting a $1.25 credit.**\n\n**Step 4:** If expiration approaches and **AVGO** is well above the short strike ($445), I will let the spread just expire worthless and thus keeping the $1.25 credit (10 contracts = $1,250).  However, there is a chance **AVGO** could threaten that short strike (e.g. on 5/22 the stock is in a bearish downtrend and at $455) I might consider closing it for a small debit. However, let's say bad news came out, or the market started crashing.  If that happens, you can leg out of Bullish Put Spreads.  \n\nThis is how:\n\n*A) The stock must be in a technical breakdown, meaning it broke through major support levels.*\n\n*B) It needs to be proportionally weak to the market.  The market may be dropping but AVGO is dropping proportionally more than the market on the 5-minutes charts (e.g. let's say at noon SPY goes into a compression for a bit, but AVGO continues to drop).*\n\n*C) The market itself should be weak that day, you do not want to leg out of a BPS in a strong market.*\n\n***Note: If you try to leg out of a spread without these conditions in place, you can wind up losing a lot more than your original max risk.***  \n\nBecause the spread is far enough out in time (6/25) you will have time (at least a few days) to act if you see it is in trouble.\n\nWhat you do is this:\n\nBuy back the short puts.  Let's say AVGO is dropping and now at $450 on 6/21.  And your short puts ($445) are worth $4.75, and your long puts (440) are worth $3.00.  At this moment you are down 50 cents per contract ($1.75 difference in the puts, minus the $1 credit you received = .50 cents down). You can either take the loss of $50 per contract (in my case that would be a loss of $500) or you can leg out.  So I would buy back the short puts at $4.75 and let the long puts ride.  I would enter a sell order on the long puts for the same price I bought back the short puts (so I put in an order to sell my $440 AVGO puts for $4.75).  As the stock continues to drop, your puts will go up in value, and if you timed it correctly with a weak market and a weak stock you will hopefully reach that goal by the end of the day.\n\nIf you sell your long puts for the same price as you bought back the short puts, you finish up your original credit of $1.25.  Seeing as how the only way this stock gets in that type of trouble is a major technical breakdown, it is the ideal stock to leg out of in that environment.  \n\n**I like to have several of these spreads going every week.  At the end of each week 2 or 3 expire and I add 2 or 3 more.  In 2020 my success rate was as follows:**\n\n***210 total spreads - the spreads averaged a total of $1,090 credit, risking $3,910:***\n\n*73.3%: 154 expired worthless - full credit* \n\n*12.8%: 27 spreads I took partial credit, averaging 81% of full credit (e.g. on $1 credit I would close the spread on average for a .19 cent debit)*\n\n*4.7%: 10 spreads I legged out of, receiving full credit.*\n\n*1.9%: 4 spreads I legged out of, receiving partial credit, averaging 72% of full credit.*\n\n7.1%: 15 spreads I lost the full amount (stock crashed on the final two days, not enough time to leg out, or market was too strong to try)\n\n**Total profit off 210 Out-Of-The-Money BPS' for 2020 = $147.087.5**\n\nAs a Day Trader, I use this method for passive income with Day Trading being my primary source of income.  My 2021 results are currently on target for the same result as the previous year.  \n\n*Pete Stolcers gets all the credit for perfecting and teaching this method - thank you.*\n\nEither way, I hope you all found this useful!",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 2, 2021**\n\nThe three major indexes traded roughly flat in an otherwise action-packed day. The rally in the movie-theater company AMC went to another level, with the company gapping up more than 100% today (up roughly 255% in the week, 570% for the month). AMC now has a larger market cap (roughly $30 billion) than Gamestop (GME) ever did at the height of its rally. In other news, market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports. \n\nThe month-long battle between short-sellers and retail investors took another drastic turn, with AMC rocketing up, reaching as high as $72.62 and overtaking Gamestop (GME) in terms of market cap. This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining. Shares of other so-called \u201cmeme stocks\u201d that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) gained more than 60% while Naked Brand Group (NAKD) and BlackBerry (BB) were up 28% and 30%, respectively. Shares of Gamestop (GME) were up roughly 13%.\n\nNew economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain. The Institute of Supply Management\u2019s headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages. The report found that companies and their suppliers \u201ccontinue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand\u201d, noting that \u201crecord lead times, wide scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments.\u201d As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. The ISM's headline index registered a reading of 61.2 in May, an increase from April's reading of 60.7 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector. Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster; readings below indicating contraction. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves, material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved. And as supply starts to meet demand, the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down.  In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the near-term. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The U.S. said Wednesday it will impose tariffs on the U.K. and five other countries in response to their taxes on U.S. technology companies, but will suspend the levies for six months as it seeks to negotiate an international resolution.\n* Tesla Inc is recalling nearly 6,000 U.S. vehicles because brake caliper bolts could be loose, with the potential to cause a loss of tire pressure, documents made public on Wednesday show.\n* Twitter Inc said Tuesday it will begin testing ads on its disappearing posts feature called Fleets, as it works to offer more options for advertisers. The company previously said it set a goal of doubling its annual revenue by 2023 from last year's levels, which it plans to achieve in part by selling ads on more parts of its site and mobile app.\n* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. \n* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\\*\\***\n* Broadcom (AVGO) target raised by Piper Sandler from $500 to $525 at Overweight. Stock currently around $474\n* Costco (COST) with two price target raises. Stock currently around $381\n   * Citigroup from $380 to $400 at Neutral \n   * Wells Fargo from $400 to $415 at Overweight\n* Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) target raised by Raymond James from $300 to $305 at Strong-Buy. Stock currently around $208\n* Charles Schwab (SCHW) target raised by Wells Fargo from $76 to $88 at Overweight. Stock currently around $75\n* Xpeng (XPEV) target raised by Citigroup from $50 to $51 at Buy. Stock currently around $35.\n* Zoom (ZM) with a host of price target raises after reports a positive earnings surprise. Average price target $387.2. Stock currently around $327\n\n\u201cThe only guarantee for failure is to stop trying.\u201d - John C Maxwell",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Objective** : Draw attention to a good investment opportunity OR Draw caution to this investment and have me reconsider my position. I'm long 6000+ warrants.-This post is focusing primarily on warrants. It summarizes key details and provides subjective opinion.

Take what I have to say with a grain of salt. That said, I hope this will provide a good information resource for those considering this investment.\n\n**Deal details/ Breakdown of funding and uses of cash:**\\-Target, Valens Semiconductor Ltd. [Valens. Pushing the Boundaries of Connectivity.](https://www.valens.com/) Deal is targeting Fall of 2021 to close.-Pipe 125mm @ 10$ , Including investment from Mediatek (a world leading SC company) Listed in Taiwan at roughly 54billion USD. [MediaTek | Homepage](https://www.mediatek.com/) , sovereign wealth funds, Breakdown is not disclosed\\*. PTK Acquisition corp will be participating in Pipe via 4mm purchase of shares @ 10$.-SPAC trust 115mm from 11.5mm share IPO\\*Primerose Development Group Limited is participating in the SPAC trust of 115mm via Forward Purchase Agreement (FPA). Primerose is comitted to hold at least 1mm common stock following the business combination. Can't find anything about this firm.-240mm cash to Valens' BS assuming no redemptions. Cash is to fund company through to positive CF, no existing shareholders will be paid out or debt paid down.\\*Opinion: strong strategic pipe, and pipe size relative to trust size seems healthy. Uses of proceeds are ideal, and sponsor participating to some degree in PIPE reflects more skin in the game.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Sponsor compensation arrangement/Warrants**\\-Sponsor holds 2.875mm CS, which represents 20% of 14.375mm float.-Sponsor holds 600,000 @ .50 each-Sponsor share vesting: 35% unvested at time of merger if a price is achieved for 20 of 30 trading days, here is the breakdown; 10% @ 12$, 12.5% @ 12.5$, 12.5% @ 15$. This is for a 3-4 year time frame.\"This not only reflects our confidence in the company, but also the fact that the PTK team intends to be very involved with the company over the long term in helping the business achieve its business plan forecast\". Source: Investor presentation/conference call.\n\n\\*Opinion: 20% sponsor shares is a rich cut for them, however the lock up is very attractive. No shares will vest within 4 years if price targets aren't achieved, and even then it's only 35% of their shares.\\*\\*QUESTION: Vesting periods for sponsor shares in the Business Combination prospectus are different from the original offering prospectus.

        "selftext": "Recently did some research into Broadcom and I think it would be a good buy if it was down like 10% from here. I tried to use a DCF model and if I did it correctly then it's around it's intrinsic value and with it having a 3% dividend yield, growing free cash flow, trading at around 20 times free cash flow, and exposure to 5G, phones, and a growing software sector it makes me feel good. The one negative I saw was the high P/E but I think it's somewhat justifiable by the low price to free cash flow ratio and the large revenue and net income growth. What do you guys think?",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Objective** : Draw attention to a good investment opportunity OR Draw caution to this investment and have me reconsider my position. I'm long 6000+ warrants.  \n\\-This post is focusing primarily on warrants. It summarizes key details and provides subjective opinion. It also poses questions to which input is appreciated. **I know literally nothing about the technology  they use and industry they operate in**, therefor I provide no opinion on the business model/reasonability of their projections. Take what I have to say with a grain of salt. \n\n**Deal details/ Breakdown of funding and uses of cash:**  \n\\-Target, Valens Semiconductor Ltd. [Valens. Pushing the Boundaries of Connectivity.](https://www.valens.com/) Deal is targeting Fall of 2021 to close.  \n\\-Pipe 125mm @ 10$ , Including investment from Mediatek (a world leading SC company) Listed in Taiwan at roughly 54billion USD. [MediaTek | Homepage](https://www.mediatek.com/) , sovereign wealth funds, Breakdown is not disclosed\\*. PTK Acquisition corp will be participating in Pipe via 4mm purchase of shares @ 10$.  \n\\-SPAC trust 115mm from 11.5mm share IPO  \n\\*Primerose Development Group Limited is participating in the SPAC trust of 115mm via Forward Purchase Agreement (FPA). Primerose is comitted to hold at least 1mm common stock following the business combination. Can't find anything about this firm.  \n\\-240mm cash to Valens' BS assuming no redemptions. Cash is to fund company through to positive CF, no existing shareholders will be paid out or debt paid down.  \n\\*Opinion: strong strategic pipe, and pipe size relative to trust size seems healthy. Uses of proceeds are ideal, and sponsor participating to some degree in PIPE reflects more skin in the game\\*.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Sponsor compensation arrangement/Warrants**  \n\\-Sponsor holds 2.875mm CS, which represents 20% of 14.375mm float.  \n\\-Sponsor holds 600,000 @ .50 each  \n\\-Sponsor share vesting: 35% unvested at time of merger if a price is achieved for 20 of 30 trading days, here is the breakdown; 10% @ 12$, 12.5% @ 12.5$, 12.5% @ 15$. This is for a 3-4 year time frame.  \n\"This not only reflects our confidence in the company, but also the fact that the PTK team intends to be very involved with the company over the long term in helping the business achieve its business plan forecast\". Source: Investor presentation/conference call.\n\n\\*Opinion: 20% sponsor shares is a rich cut for them, however the lock up is very attractive. No shares will vest within 4 years if price targets aren't achieved, and even then it's only 35% of their shares.  \n\\*\\*QUESTION: Vesting periods for sponsor shares in the Business Combination prospectus are different from the original offering prospectus.

They are not able to be cash settled in lieu of physical settlement.  \n\\-There are 6mm Private Placement warrants, which were originally placed at .50$ but may have changed hands/been sold to retail since (they were trading 1$+ in Dec-Feb.

        "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI've created a Regular Bullish MACD divergence scanner based on Dr. Alexander Elder book's, one of my referents when it comes to trading.\n\nIt's not my intention to say this is a \"gold mine\", especially because this scanner is almost impossible to find on the internet. However, I've tested it and I think it gives really nice outputs.\n\nToday, June 19th, after running the scanner for the S&amp;P 500 list, these are the results:\n\nWeekly time frame: CTXS\n\nDaily time frame: ALK\n\n4HR time frame: HD, NKE, DE, PNC, PGR, HPQ, SWK, BBY, MLM, DRI, PHM, WHR, UAA, UA, LEG, VNT\n\nExample for NKE 4 HR time frame:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2mt6h4bcb671.png?width=2184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=319acf395be73d06569302ba82d8845d3c6b0505\n\nWhat you guys think ? I would really appreciate getting some feedback.",
