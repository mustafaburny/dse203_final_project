        "selftext": " \n\nPlease   help... I've created a mess with my portfolio during rona and entered     into way too many positions. A lot of them I held and kept raising my     stop and just never hit it so continued to hold swing trades I was  in.    I'm looking to attempt to consolidate down and put more into  FAANG    stocks/ETFS.\n\nBelow is a  breakdown of my portfolio including the gain/loss in each equity and how  much %   of  my account it makes up. Suggestions as far as sells and    re-allocations  would be very helpful.\n\nSymbol\tDescription\tGain/Loss %\t% Of Account\n\n1. ATVI\tACTIVISION BLIZZARD\t23.21%\t1.15%\n2.
