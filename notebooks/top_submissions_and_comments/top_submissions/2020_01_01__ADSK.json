        "selftext": "Hi fellow subredditors,  \n  \nAre you trying to become the next Warren Buffet? Are you trying to use fundamental analysis, using metrics like P/E to buy cheap stocks in order to gain long-term alpha? Is it not working out that well? If it isn't working, this PSA is for you.  \n  \nBuying a stock based on fundamentals with no context is like buying a house that's 3 bed, 2.5 bath, and 2000 square feet without knowing other important details. Sure, you could simply *pay less* for those walled-off requirements, but that doesn't make it a *good deal*. Location matters. Condition matters. Year built matters. The finishes matter. Special features matter. The size of the yard matters. Taxes and HOA matter. If all you look at is the beds, baths, and square footage, you would end up with ONLY run down houses in bad locations that cost you more in the long run. $HPQ with a lower P/E, higher dividend, and technically higher growth than $ADSK does not inherent make it a better stock to own. (Note: this is not an endorsement for either).  \n  \nAs much as fundamental analysis can do for us, it can also lead us widely astray. It's different than technical analysis, but don't think it is inherent *better*; used wrong, it can also be *objectively worse*. It mostly depends on how it is used. All that being said, please don't be afraid to run DCF or whatever, which is incredibly useful, but do it in context and with judgement.  \n  \nRegards.",
