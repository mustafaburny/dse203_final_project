        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # 2. Social Metaverse Investing\n\nYou know, before formally introducing this writing, I have to admit that there is a particular challenge when it comes to writing this book and that is modifying for correct predictions or fundamental market shifts. This statement existed in the financial technology chapter but makes more sense to move up  here in the technology introduction where we discuss the evolution of social media. That is because the subject of conversation for the next few years will be the metaverse or the third iteration of the internet. This subject of conversation was essentially referenced in this chapter but the information is far more clear now and requires this final edit or revision. So let's begin.\n\nIt likely makes sense to discuss and break down what a social network really is since it is something that has significantly changed human behavior. I like to invest in what I frame as intent-based social media and this is likely a function of my age and relationship with the internet. An intent-based social media platform is a network where the user is likely to use the application as a tool before considering entertainment. In short, social media exists on a spectrum ranging from intention to entertainment. One could see how a platform like TikTok is geared toward entertainment, while a platform like Pinterest is designed for intention. In this spectrum, we find many others in the middle like YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.\n\nThis spectrum is critical to understand because it governs what kind of algorithms are used to drive the platform. In the case of entertainment-based media, like Instagram or TikTok, the platform seeks to understand the user so that it can fetch content that will entertain them. Entertainment is a highly subjective endeavor which forces the platforms to depend on algorithms to connect users and content. It is the open field form. On the other side, the intent-based platform serves a designed function and relationship with the content creator. For example, we visit Pinterest to create useful ideas, allowing content-creators to focus on the context of the platform. Google indexes websites so that users can portal into a library of website owners and services. Reddit curates loyal communities to drive its information and space.\n\nThe critical element of this spectrum is the complex conversations that drive privacy and security on platforms. Social media is how we interface with the internet and it is what we refer to as the second iteration of the internet. To briefly shift the tone of this conversation, the entertainment platform suffer from misinformation and propaganda driven campaigns. This is a natural consequence of relying on algorithms that depend on short and effective messaging and may ultimately affect intent-based platforms that orbit closer to entertainment, like Reddit or Youtube. They are called Influencers after all. The conversations surrounding privacy ultimately discuss these worst-case scenarios, so they're important to be mindful of historically and forward-looking.\n\nWith this issue highlighted, I would like to admit that one of my prediction about Facebook was correct. It will exist in social media forever, due to most applications using Facebook's software development ecosystems to create websites and applications on any device. This is similar to how Oracle will essentially exist forever as part of the computing world due to its widespread demand for system maintenance and improvements. This is set in stone and Facebook's drive for the metaverse ultimately points to how the leadership behind Facebook understands that social media is a forum that ebbs and flows with the population over time. So let's explore the thinking behind the leading social media platform and why it knows how to navigate and pivot its product over the years and how it lead to Roblox becoming Facebook's primary competitor for the next decade by examining Pinterest so that we can understand what social media truly is as a first generation investor.\n\nA social media platform is a forum. A forum is a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged. Each forum accomplishes this in its own unique way.  Twitter is fundamentally used to search for what someone is saying, while Pinterest is used to search for ideas. Pinterest is a particularly interesting case due to hundreds of millions of women adopting the platform and achieving what Google+ had failed to accomplish - a social media platform that harnesses the power of search. I believe this is also an interesting examination of how influential women are to the market. One can question if Apple or Google would be as successful as they are without the seismic changes that the American workforce has adapted.\n\nThis spectrum distinction continues be important when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat because an investor would not want to mistake the differences between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart. So is Pinterest a social media platform, search service, or both? With this in mind, we might begin to see why Facebook implementing a hashtag, Instagram implementation stories, or TikTok implementing streams may be irrelevant when understanding the full potential of a service like Snapchat or Twitter and the wisdoms the drive its growth in the market. Before ever investing in a company you need to discover and completely understand the incentives that drive the customers to return to the product. Without that, you are ultimately gambling in the market and driving through a fog hoping that things will turn out well.\n\nWhat drives a social networking site is a user\u2019s incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is best served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.\n\nThe forum may take on a different medium. Google is used to answer information, Facebook allows us to connect, while online gaming satisfies our needs for adventure. When you examine the nature of a forum and a user\u2019s incentive to participate in that forum, you\u2019ll come to understand why a applications like Twitter, Pinterest, or online games like Roblox are a force of nature. These forums engage and fulfill our very real needs and demands as social beings. It will also help you understand why companies like Facebook would endeavor in metaverse products like virtual reality games and other forms of social media.\n\nPinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or Reddit, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. This is what is known as \u201cpersonal media\u201d rather than typical \u201csocial media\u201d. This is a characteristic that I believe grants a media platform a longer product lifespan. It will also be quite relevant when it comes to conversations about how users interact with the metaverse. Clearly, there will be users that enjoy the extroverted elements of it, while introverted users may prefer the personal media aspects of it. What I try to imagine is that the Instagram \"mall\" may be a more social space than the Pinterest \"mall\" in the metaverse.\n\nThe network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in is word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine rather than an application to connect with friends or family. As a result, Pinterest\u2019s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.  This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption. Most American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users.  \n\nThese customers are voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest\u2019s customers are in a high willingness to engage with things that result in action. In other words, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future. Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is effectively a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they\u2019re getting top \"real estate\" advertisements. With a simple search, you\u2019re welcomed to a rich library of consumable ideas for health, gifts, beauty, travelling, home developments, and millions of other regularly marketed products that influence the home.\n\nPinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the platform as a power tool. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different from Facebook\u2019s connect-everything approach to social-networking. It is less wasteful and more effective.\n\nYou may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new. As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less \"the web\", where website links are the lifeblood to Google search. A good link is extremely valuable to Google.\n\nDue to this relationship, it is in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best, fastest, and most well-rounded results. This means that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.  This partially explains why searching for \"Lebron James\" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites.  Similarly, searching for \"Vegan food near me\" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.\n\nThere are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb; the more well-developed a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of well-developed changes. An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develop tools like in-app browsers and support integration with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader of the internet. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet\u2019s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately the access to information, which is as statistically scarce as the access to clean water and sanitation around the globe. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.\n\nI totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life and scale as one of the most valuable internet properties similar to how Roblox breeched the family household and maintained relevancy over the years. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest and things like Roblox are a reliable and effective advertising space.\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I regularly seek to delete it. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest, I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. And Facebook is pivoting itself to exist in such a way that it is impossible to delete. That, to me, is incredible.",

New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**\n\nThe market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming. A Netflix subscription is required but there is no additional cost. \n* Elon Musk clarified via Twitter (TWTR) that there was no contract signed yet between Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) to buy the 100,000 EVs. A Hertz spokeswoman said deliveries of Tesla had already started. A link on Hertz\u2019s website gives users the option to rent a Tesla Model 3. However, Hertz declines to comment beyond its original statement saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss the details of our business relationships or discussions with any auto maker or partner\u201d.\n* With the recent surge in Tesla, Elon Musk became the first person to have a personal net worth surpassing $300 billion, absolutely insane. If he were a company, he\u2019d be a top 30 company in the US by market cap by himself.\n* Green Bay Quarterback Aaron Rodgers teamed up with Square (SQ) to give away $1 million in BT.... as part of a promotion and will begin receiving part of his massive $33.5 million salary in that currency. \n* Amazon (AMZN) seeks approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch two Project Kuiper satellites in 2022.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 4, 2021**\n\nThe good times keep on rolling! The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the \u201csubstantial progress\u201d benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.\n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nSpecifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on \"changes in the economic outlook.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. \n\nNew weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**\n\nThe market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming. A Netflix subscription is required but there is no additional cost. \n* Elon Musk clarified via Twitter (TWTR) that there was no contract signed yet between Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) to buy the 100,000 EVs. A Hertz spokeswoman said deliveries of Tesla had already started. A link on Hertz\u2019s website gives users the option to rent a Tesla Model 3. However, Hertz declines to comment beyond its original statement saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss the details of our business relationships or discussions with any auto maker or partner\u201d.\n* With the recent surge in Tesla, Elon Musk became the first person to have a personal net worth surpassing $300 billion, absolutely insane. If he were a company, he\u2019d be a top 30 company in the US by market cap by himself.\n* Green Bay Quarterback Aaron Rodgers teamed up with Square (SQ) to give away $1 million in BTC as part of a promotion and will begin receiving part of his massive $33.5 million salary in that currency. \n* Amazon (AMZN) seeks approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch two Project Kuiper satellites in 2022. Similar to SpaceX, it intends to be a broad constellation of internet and broadband satellites.\n* EV startup Rivian which is backed by Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motors (F) announced it was seeking a $53 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Akamai Technology target raised by Morgan Stanley from $119 to $130.
