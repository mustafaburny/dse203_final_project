        "selftext": "$AEHL - High risk / high reward play. This support is very strong and if we can break the resistance trendline - we may have a massive winner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEthan Allan  - Amazing channel up, and strong support right below this trend. I just called it 2 weeks ago, can we do it again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$KLAC - We are coming down right to value. Anywhere near $310 is a great deal and right in the pocket of convergence, I love it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$NMIH - SHORT! I called it 2 weeks ago to run, it did - now let's ride it down. YOU MUST use a limit buy above incase it rises FOR SURE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$NOVA - Amazing triangle is forming, but I want it under $35 for value. Long term makes a bunch of sense, this is a great looking setup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$ON   - Amazing value right here, right in trend, near support and 200EMA? That is a beautiful setup for sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$UNM  - Need a lower price, but this is entering right to our area of value. I need to also watch earnings - but this could have a huge runup.",
