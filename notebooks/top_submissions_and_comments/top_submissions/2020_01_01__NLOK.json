        "selftext": "So, this stock is going to get a lot of talk in the coming weeks as they prepare to give out a 12 dollar per share dividend. People will get hyped about the free 40% without understanding whats going on.\n\n Let me break it down for you. \n\nBuy Nlok now 26.45 cents\n\nOwn Nlok Through January 23rd through Feb 3rd (you have to own past Jan 31st to get dividend you won't be able to sell till Feb. 3rd cause weekend).\n\nYou will receive 12 dollars per share congrats.\n\nSo what's the catch? \n\nThe stock is now worth 14.45, you were given your money back. Put's and calls will be adjusted accordingly it's a 0 sum game.\n\nSo how do you make money? Well I'm not smart enough to tell you that, but its probably going to get a lot of headlines and alot of people buying running the price up because they don't understand. There will also probably be a sell off after the dividend.\n\nI'd say the best time to get into this stock is after the selloff for the long term hold potential of the company. \n\nrecommended reading [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NLOK/community?p=NLOK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NLOK/community?p=NLOK)",

        "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time post, first option trade.\nThis is a small time bet so all you big time autists don't waste you're time here.\nSo I recently was gifted 54 shares of NLOK(formerly SYM). They are paying out a special dividend of $12.00 per share at the end of the month. So I guess my question to the more seasoned investors here is do you think that dividend is priced in? The stock is at about 26.15 right now. Should I bet that the stock will drop about 10 to 12 bucks a share after the payout? I would assume some holders are only holding because of this payout and will ditch it afterwards. \nThis would be my first options trade as I haven't developed full blown autism yet...

I understand the div is to be paid by the 3rd of feb but could I sell the stock on the first &amp; still receive the div on the third. \n\n2. Obviously the stock price will drop after the div is issued any idea on how extreme will this be?, I see some people saying it will drop $12 making the gains flat with the div pay out but will this happen instantly or do you think it could it be possible to take the div and sell out on a 1-5$ drop \n\nCheers, new to trading and this is the first time I\u2019ve come across a \u201cspecial dividend\u201d so I\u2019m interested to see how this would play out, anyone have any experiences with this type of thing, thanks, Hilly.",

If you look at the companies that have benefited the most from increases WIFI and mobile internet speeds over the last decade it has been companies like Netflix, who have used advances in technology to disrupt traditional markets.\n\nThe effects have also been seen in cloud computing with Amazon and Microsoft, and advertising with Google/Amazon (faster networks/easier access = more searches)\n\nOver the next decade there will certainly be companies who leverage 5G to deepen their competitive advantages or new companies that emerge that will disrupt current markets.

        "selftext": "So, 2019 was a bit of a rocky year. I started off making an immense amount of money, lost all of my gain shorting Qualcomm on news of their apple settlement in April.  Took me months to recover, but I got stupid towards the end of the year shorting apple, thinking it HAD to go down and constantly in denial. Big share counts too. like 5 to 10000 shares short day trading\n\nThere would be enormous sums of trades to show in the whole account- but I did much better, ironically, in my account where I only day traded options.\n\nMy biggest lessons: cut the loss quickly.  Don't wait, don't guess. If I had done this, i would be much more green.\n\nLesson two: don't let a bias overrule you. I did this w apple towards the end of the year. Fortunately I did not get carried away and start buying puts as it was going up too. CNBC pushed it higher , and I ignored this. I could have easily flipped the trade.\n\nLesson three: listen to your instincts.  Don't get flustered or become a deer in headlights. I repeated these errors again on numerous occasions. Do not become fixated on a past price where you may have had a paper profit. Stock doesn't care about prior levels.\n\nAlso, I noticed the increasing effects cnbc can have on stocks. Lower float unusual options plays, and the time I lost on apple they kept talking of a super cycle.  This just caused me to lost 40k on a short in one day. I could have covered much sooner.\nNot a terrible year, but I repeated these mistakes more times than I should have.\n\nResults below:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/mJM6SzQ\n\nhttps://ibb.co/Qjxf026",
