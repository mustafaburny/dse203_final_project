        "selftext": "Back in March, long before a short seller would raise questions about electric-truck company Nikola Corp. and hasten its founder\u2019s exit, early investors in the company were expressing concerns of their own.Those investors, led by mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments, were worried that Trevor Milton, for all his brash visionary talk and Twitter braggadocio, lacked the ability that Elon Musk possesses to deliver these sorts of newfangled products to market. They lobbied successfully to remove him as CEO before the company\u2019s June IPO and for Milton\u2019s father to leave the board, according to people familiar with the matter. When the deal was done, Milton only held the title of chairman, the post he resigned this month.\n\nThe back-room negotiations show that Milton\u2019s past was a concern to investors months before General Motors Co. executives placed a bet on the company in a US$2 billion deal carved out after the IPO. They liked Milton\u2019s vision and his ability to raise cash and felt the venture was safeguarded from his shortcomings in operations by his push upstairs, say people familiar with the matter. Nonetheless, the events that have unfolded since the short-seller report, with Nikola\u2019s stock plunging amid a steady stream of negative headlines, have exposed just how high the risks still were.\n\nNow, it\u2019s up to former GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, whose blank-check company VectoIQ took Nikola public via reverse merger in June, and Nikola CEO Mark Russell to stabilize the business and regain investor confidence. The plan with GM was to use Nikola\u2019s hot stock and Milton\u2019s ability to raise money to build a hydrogen-fueled trucking business with GM\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201cThere is obviously someone on the diligence side who isn\u2019t going to get a nice bonus this year,\u201d said Reilly Brennan, founder of the venture capital fund Trucks Inc. \u201cThe best possible thing if you\u2019re a shareholder is that Milton is no longer running the company and you have Girsky as chairman and GM providing technology.\u201d\n\nThe GM deal was originally scheduled to close Sept. 30, and the automaker has said it plans to carry through, but that timing may slip, say people familiar with the matter. BP Plc is still engaged with Nikola in talks to partner on a network of hydrogen fueling stations for fuel-cell trucks the company hopes to sell, but also is slowing the pace for a deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. BP and GM declined to comment.\n\nMilton\u2019s tale reads like a Greek tragedy. The report by short seller Hindenburg Research accused Milton of overhyping Nikola\u2019s technology and has prompted investigations by the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A cousin has accused him of a decades-ago sexual assault, which he denies. The company\u2019s value peaked at US$30 billion and is now worth about US$7 billion.\n\nGirsky and GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra have both said publicly that they did plenty of due diligence. People familiar with the matter say that GM found out when scouting the deal that it had better batteries and fuel-cell technology but joined forces because Nikola had a working semi truck and access to capital markets. In addition, GM will get paid to build Nikola\u2019s Badger pickup on existing assembly lines. Milton was so excited to get the Badger pickup program moving that he signed a deal that heavily favored GM, one of the people said.\n\nNikola\u2019s stock and GM\u2019s US$2 billion stake are worth less than half what they were on Sept. 8, when the deal was announced. Milton\u2019s own stake is worth US$1.7 billion, down from almost US$5 billion at one point.\n\nMilton said in a June interview with Bloomberg News that he grew up in modest surroundings in Layton, Utah. His family moved to Las Vegas when he was very young and he lost his mother to cancer shortly after moving back to Utah in the sixth grade. He wrote on Twitter he didn\u2019t finish high school, earning an equivalency certification instead, and later dropped out of college. His Twitter account has since been deleted.\n\nHe grew up in a tight-knit Mormon family, according to Aubrey Smith, his first cousin. She went on social media recently and accused him of sexually assaulting her in 1999 when she was 15 and he was 17.\n\nIn a public account on Facebook and Twitter, and repeated in a phone interview, Smith said that Milton came onto her at the funeral of their grandfather. He took her shirt off without permission, Smith wrote, and then he touched her inappropriately before someone knocked at the door and she ran out.\n\nMilton denied the allegations through a spokesman.\n\nSmith said Milton raised money from family members to get his start. He founded and ran several businesses, including a home-security company that Milton claims he sold for US$1.5 million. Next, in 2009, he founded an e-commerce platform called Upillar.com, which Milton claims \u201cpioneered the shopping cart online.\u201d\n\nThen he got into clean propulsion but ended up embroiled in litigation with dHybrid Inc., which he founded in 2009. The company retrofitted diesel vehicles with natural-gas-burning turbines, claiming the dual system had greater efficiency.\n\nBut a deal with Swift Transportation Co. in 2010 ended in court when Swift alleged dHybrid defaulted on a US$322,000 loan and that it retrofitted only half of the agreed vehicles. The case was dismissed in 2015.\n\nMilton later tried to sell dHybrid to a company called sPower in May 2012 but that, too, got mired in lawsuits after sPower backed out and accused Milton of exaggerating its technological capabilities.\n\nAmid the litigation, Milton started another company with a very similar name, dHybrid Systems, selling it in 2014 to Worthington Industries.\n\nDuring an interview with Bloomberg in June, Milton said that dHybrid Inc. was a success but conceded that, \u201cwe ended up closing that one down because of some litigation.\u201d\n\nHis next startup was Nikola, founding it in 2014 in Salt Lake City before moving to Phoenix. Emulating Musk, he took the name from the electricity pioneer Nikola Tesla, and the company was soon billed as the Tesla of Trucks. His plan was seen as potentially disrupting the entire transportation industry by making trucks that ran on batteries or hydrogen-fuel cells. He also planned to build a network of hydrogen filling stations.\n\nFriends and Family\n\nMilton had friends and family members working for Nikola despite resumes that didn\u2019t match the job. His brother, Travis Milton, is director of hydrogen and infrastructure. His LinkedIn profile shows that most of his experience was being \u201cself-employed\u201d in Maui. The short seller, Hindenburg Research, said that Travis Milton poured concrete as a contractor. Milton\u2019s father Bill was originally on the board but stepped down when VectoIQ took the company public.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock prospectus said that Nikola had awarded more than 3 million stock options \u201cto recognize the superior performance and contribution of specific employees.\u201d The list included Travis Milton and an uncle, Lance Milton, the document said, acknowledging that they are relatives.\n\nAs Milton went public with Nikola\u2019s technology, questions soon arose involving his claims about the company\u2019s fuel-cell system. He bragged in an investor video in 2019 that the company had created \u201cwhat other manufacturers said was impossible to design.\u201d But while Nikola holds patents in fuel-cell and battery technology, most of its planned hardware was coming from German supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh.\n\nNikola Demonstrations\n\nIt became clear that Milton had gotten ahead of himself. A 2016 demonstration showed a truck that didn\u2019t have a working hydrogen-fuel-cell system and was missing key parts, people familiar with the matter said in June. Milton said at the time that the parts were removed as a safety precaution.\n\nIn July of this year, he recorded a video of the semi truck in which he ran alongside the vehicle as it coasted at low speeds in a parking lot. Aping Musk\u2019s combative social-media persona, Milton took a shot at his detractors saying, \u201cthese damned trolls, I wonder if they are going to apologize to everyone for the lies they spread the tens of thousands of comments about how fake we are.\u201d\n\nGirsky said in the webcast \u201cAutoline This Week,\u201d in which Bloomberg participated, that he has been in Nikola\u2019s fuel-cell trucks and that they work.\n\nStill, when the GM deal was done, GM will be supplying all of the technology for every global market except Europe. Nikola\u2019s pickup truck, called Badger, will use GM\u2019s Ultium battery, and the semis will run on a fuel cell developed by GM and Honda Motor Co.\n\nSince Milton\u2019s departure, Nikola has billed itself more as an integrator of other technologies into its Badger pickup and semi trucks.\n\nFor GM\u2019s part, the automaker is protected from any financial downside. GM got 11 per cent of the stock for no cash investment and gets paid for its technology. If Nikola fails, GM won\u2019t lose a dime.\n\nMilton has remained silent and is out of the company. He unknowingly presaged his own downfall in the June interview with Bloomberg: \u201cPart of becoming a better person in life is losing everything you have got and having nothing left.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nikola-founder-milton-s-fall-reveals-what-his-backers-feared-1.1500376",

Secular bull markets are prolonged super-cycles in which the market produces above average returns.\n* Factors supporting the secular thesis include de-equitization (the number of public stocks is declining), a highly accommodative monetary policy, and a weaker dollar.\n\nInterested in hearing your opinions.",

Since 1973, currency hedging has detracted from  returns in 50% of quarters, and contributed to returns in 50% of all  quarters (see chart).\"",

My instincts as a product design manager makes compare the UI design between Robinhood and Fidelity and found the following:\n1. Robinhood\u2019s real-time stock price update makes me more anxious when following stock prices. \n2. The coloring and loss/gain percentages gives me dopamine rush, which triggers me to unconsciously open up the app every few minutes throughout the day. \n3.

        "selftext": "**Alliance Data Systems: A Special Situation Value Proposition**\n\nTl;dr ADS\u2019s revenue hasn\u2019t suffered much, but cash flows and income have due to debt restructuring which has changed valuation metrics significantly, but this may not be something to worry about but rather something to take advantage of.\n\nAlliance Data systems is a provider of private label credit cards to retail businesses like Ulta, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Pottery Barn, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, IKEA etc. and Alliance owns LoyaltyOne which runs Air Miles (been damaged severely, duh), and has partnerships with several other global retailers. Alliance attempts to capture transaction data to help companies create marketing strategies and to help understand what their consumer base wants and needs, they\u2019re entire mission is centered around making sure producers are able to reduce their costs, focus on making products that are wanted, and improve their bottom line. \n\nAnalysis of consumer data is obviously very lucrative and several companies thrive off of this alone, but ADS will almost be a FinTech+Marketing company combined which will possibly revive it into the growth stock it once was promised to be.\n\nAlliance is partly a credit services/marketing company, so the structure of the company is a bit complex, but I\u2019ll try to demystify the financials here soon. \n\nFirst I\u2019d like to point out that Alliance is a plateauing company in terms of the top line; revenue:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c06npxsuufn51.png?width=250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ee6c3d4e73e23f7621f66b436adecdfa5ced530\n\nYou can see here that for the past 3 years revenue has seemed relatively flat, and why this isn\u2019t that bad is because Alliance is shedding some weight. Just last year they sold Epsilon, a small marketing division that was losing sales for 3.5B in cash ([https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2019/04/16/alliance-data-epsilon-publicis-groupe.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2019/04/16/alliance-data-epsilon-publicis-groupe.html)) and they intended on using the proceeds to deleverage and redistribute cash to shareholders via a dividend hike. This may make the company seem weak, but Epsilon was a terrible fit for Alliance\u2019s private credit based services, and the extra cash will be really helpful for their future plans. It was a perfect time to spin off and get rid of a dead limb, which they finally did. A big reason why net income was down so much this past year but revenue was not is because of this sale and its fees along with debt restructuring, which increased expenses by a great deal as you will see below, and a lot of this expense was spread throughout other expenses as well: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnczngzwufn51.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffcb28fdcf6a8731220c6ddb86830eb02d67cbc1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose 3 lines before adjusted EBITDA added a lot to their expenditures, and the income from the continuing operations was partly lower because of earlier OpEx increases most likely attributed to both debt restructuring and the selling of Epsilon.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean by a change in debt, financing cash flows have declined a lot, which makes overall cash flows look a lot lower, therefore scaring investors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eo1uf17zufn51.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fa5733fe5fd4c0b1037f40e1983b61a3a425a45\n\nOn top of that, they recently paid off a large amount of debt and increased invested cash flows\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ysqh6148vfn51.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=771dfe50383b7b7a144e5d5219543640c0605397\n\nThey also had lower defaults for their private credit cards in 2019, resulting in more healthy debt for the company. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8a86ay9vfn51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2be4684f013988dbf052e0404b15edf7001b33a\n\nNow let\u2019s look into some basic fundamentals of the finances outside of the situation going on right now\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Low SGA\\/Gross profit therefore decreasing expenses relative to growth](https://preview.redd.it/zikqh0qcvfn51.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595b8e0a8fa0526dd6ecdbd9bdcd1db1f660042a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Increasing gross profits for the past few years](https://preview.redd.it/592fcpzevfn51.png?width=396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d96e038ef6692cbf2f1a513d8a395c1cc411223)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Increased cash has resulted in a dividend hike from 2.28 to 2.52 this year](https://preview.redd.it/u39q0czhvfn51.png?width=415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0ad3dbe9aaed1306bdf53fa9662e40d875c507a)\n\n[Big decrease in long term debt, and we should see this go lower in the future as well.](https://preview.redd.it/z1jnyz04wfn51.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4191bb238f3d4dd2fc52260f6e79a448f64de281)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Low Enterprise Value-Sales ratio, always a good buy in indicator](https://preview.redd.it/pduggpd6wfn51.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc3822c623dae41daff7162a644e78ec20e1272a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Super low price\\/sales despite mostly stable sales numbers](https://preview.redd.it/brtinjc8wfn51.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8987a9da5dd9bca2a9c88f67c4bc5b2dfe1c1ac)\n\nAlso ADS has a P/E of only 7.4, a forward P/E of just 4.1, a Price/Cash ratio of 0.43, and a Price/FCF of only 2. This along with the fact that competitors FIS,GPN,FISV,PCOM have way higher valuation multiples and the fact that ADS has very low WACC due to its primary financing being debt financing makes it a no-brainer for the average Joe value investor, because analyst targets are currently setting the price for this one at 62$. Not only that, but most conservative estimates of its intrinsic value will show it to be around the 80$ range. But I also think that this stock has major growth potential because instead of being a super asset and debt heavy company, ADS will now focus more on the data and service side of their business, making them a FinTech firm of sorts. They are big enough to be able to finance any sort of project that leans more into data analysis and tech, plus they have broad global overreach in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe where it\u2019ll be easier to transfer their new lightweight business platform. But deleveraging can be a very difficult process, and it\u2019s definitely not without pitfalls. Since this is a pretty big company that\u2019s in the S&amp;P 500 though, they have more than enough cash to fall back on if this restructuring doesn\u2019t go as planned, and while 2019 was shaping out to be a decent year for ADS, if you see the most recent 10-Q, there is a lot of impact from COVID on their margins, with revenues falling by 50% from the same quarter last year:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/66fptqmbwfn51.png?width=476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf054135e2c19eabfd1f78b37c163accdfcff348\n\nBut in my opinion, this just makes it a better buying opportunity. This is one of those really heavily damaged companies in a very damaged industry that\u2019s got a lot of growth potential up its sleeve. At this point, I don\u2019t know how much of a short term prospect there would be for the share price itself, but there\u2019s a lot cooking underlying the price that may not be so obvious to investors. I think the panic selling has created a great storm for the value investor to rake up this stock at a huge discount price. It may continue to see more downturn still, but so far it seems relatively stagnant and just waiting for this bump in the road to come to an end. \n\nLMK if you have any experience with them below\n\nTl;Dr, If you have no idea when this'll moon and you love gambling on whether or not this'll be like SQ buy calls for whenever, probably LEAPs. but overall mad undervalued so buy shares for your ROTH if you have some extra cash laying around",

        "selftext": "Long story short, I started investing through a robo-advisor(Blooom). While that journey could be a post of itself, what I\u2019m finding is that the my fidelity indexes aren\u2019t making me money. I know investing in companies is high risk, high reward. So it makes sense short-term they should be making me a lot more, but in the same period of time these fidelity indexes have lost capital.\n\nSo here comes the question: Am I wasting my money buying shares of fidelity versus a better known index fund like Nasdaq or S&amp;P? The zero fees attached is nice, but my research of short-term and overall interest gained in market shares suggests that Fidelity stock this robo-advisor chose is doing extremely poorly. S&amp;P for instance has risen 16% since Aug 2018, Fidelity zero international index has dropped 1%. \n\nIs this just a result of an international index vs a US index or is fidelity just a poor investment? Thank you for your input in advance.",

        "selftext": "USD has declined almost 10% compared to rest of the world. What is the best way to hedge this risk?\n\nI am very new to this, so this post is more asking for a discussion than me providing an answer.\n\nI found this article in Fidelity interesting: [https://www.fidelity.com/insights/markets-economy/prepare-weaker-dollar?ah=1](https://www.fidelity.com/insights/markets-economy/prepare-weaker-dollar?ah=1)\n\nText:\n\n&gt;U.S. investors are used to a strong dollar, and most don\u2019t pay attention to its fluctuations. But the greenback\u2019s value, relative to other major currencies, has fallen 10% over the past five months\u2014and many expect the slide to continue. Investors have three options\u2014stick to the original portfolio and simply ride out the currency fluctuations; shift into asset classes that tend to do better under a weakening dollar; and/or seek out investments designed to take advantage of a falling dollar.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After the greenback suffered its worst month in a decade, investors are wondering why the drop. Here\u2019s a close look at the forces behind it.\u00a9 Financial Times 2020. These presentations are provided for informational purposes only.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The dollar\u2019s recent fall is primarily a result of the U.S. government\u2019s monetary easing policies in response to the pandemic-triggered economic disruptions. Lower interest rates have made the currency less attractive to hold. In addition, the dollar supply surged as the Federal Reserve opened swap lines with other central banks. And the huge fiscal stimulus and mounting national debt have boosted demand for foreign capital.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What\u2019s more, as life in many parts of the world has begun to get back on track, the U.S. still doesn\u2019t have Covid-19 under control. \u201cThe second-quarter GDP is the weakest we\u2019ve seen on record,\u201d says Schroders investment strategist Whitney Sweeney. \u201cThat\u2014along with the increasing coronavirus infections\u2014is really adding to concerns about weaker economic growth in the U.S. Simply being the haven is not going to be enough to bolster the dollar going forward.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Indeed, this might be the beginning of an extended dollar decline, says Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. She expects the currency to drop another 5% to 10% in the next year or two. \u201cThe Fed\u2019s forward guidance says they\u2019ll keep the rates low and liquidity ample for a couple of years. That\u2019s a signal to the market that they don\u2019t have a lot to fear in other currencies,\u201d she says. \u201cInvestors have been heavily weighted in dollar assets, and now might be the time to diversify a little more broadly.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Investors could dial up their allocation to international assets, which typically benefit from a weakening dollar. Since foreign-based companies report their earnings in the local currency, U.S. investors will enjoy a larger gain when translating those numbers into dollars. For a well-diversified exposure, the $24 billion Vanguard Total International Stock ETF ( [VXUS](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=VXUS) ), which owns some 7,000 stocks from more than 45 countries, returned 18% over the past three months, beating the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ( [SPY](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=SPY)) by more than two percentage points.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Investors should check whether an international fund is hedged against currency fluctuations or not. The hedged funds can protect returns when the dollar strengthens but will underperform when a cheaper dollar gives international assets an extra lift. While hedged and unhedged funds generate similar returns over the long run, in the short term, there can be big differences. Over the past three months, for example, the $49 billion iShares MSCI EAFE exchange-traded fund ( [EFA](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=EFA) ) gained 16.2%, while the $2.3 billion iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF ( [HEFA](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=HEFA) ) returned just 9.9%. \u201cIf the dollar continues to weaken, the unhedged funds should do better than the hedged funds,\u201d says Morningstar ETF specialist Alex Bryan.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A falling dollar can lead to inflation\u2014higher prices for everything from apparel to airline fares. The core consumer price index, while still running lower than a year ago, jumped 0.6% from June to July, marking the fastest monthly rise since 1991. Yet, many economists say it\u2019s too soon to worry. \u201cWe doubt that the rise in CPI in July is the start of a trend to higher inflation,\u201d says Jones. \u201cWith the unemployment rate over 10% and excess capacity in so many industries, it\u2019s unlikely that inflation can move up in a meaningful way this year.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Investors who want to be extra-cautious can shift some of their Treasuries into Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, whose face value rises with the consumer price index. Due to the Treasuries\u2019 very low yields, however, Jones says that investors should \u201cpurely look at it as a hedge, rather than something that can produce income.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hard assets like commodities are another hedge against inflation. Precious metals, in particular, have soared lately. ETFs such as the $33 billion iShares Gold Trust ( [IAU](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=IAU) ) and $14 billion iShares Silver Trust ( [SLV](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=SLV) ) are backed by physical commodities and closely track their prices. The $967 million Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking ETF ( [DBC](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=DBC) ) offers a broader exposure, with futures contracts on 14 heavily traded commodities. Stock in companies that mine and trade commodities are another option, though usually more volatile.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Finally, to specifically profit from a falling dollar, investors can directly bet on foreign currencies through the $76 million Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bearish ETF ( [UDN](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=UDN) ), which shorts the U.S. Dollar Index futures contracts and makes money if the dollar drops against six other major currencies. Be aware of the concentration risk; the euro alone accounts for half of the move.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Morningstar\u2019s Bryan recommends the iShares International Treasury Bond ETF ( [IGOV](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=IGOV) ) as a more diversified alternative; it owns a broad basket of government bonds from non-U.S. developed markets. Since interest rates in these countries are close to zero, the fund largely moves against the dollar\u2019s value. But that also means no additional gains besides the currency movement. Bryan warns: \u201cYou are not really getting paid for holding the Treasuries, but it\u2019s a safe place to park the money while you are riding out the movements of the dollar.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Alright folks -- let's get a bit more involved than yelling (catchphrase)\u2020 at each other, and try to add some reasoning in. Dumb and useless since the market has no logic, I know, but I need something better than staring at weekend dow and jerking off. I want to discuss some different timeframes - the daily thread typically has people arguing with each other when one is holding leaps and the other is holding weeklies. They might both be right, so let's be specific.\n\nHere's a list of questions to get us started, and I'll add my own thoughts on all of these. Voice your opinion, but please also include the _why_. That way we can think through it together. Mainly interested in SPY/IWM, but all thoughts welcome. Stuff like \"cruise lines stock\" probably deserves a separate look.\n\n* Has the month of September been the start of a larger downtrend? If yes, how long do you expect this to continue?\n* Are we seeing a reversal of the downtrend/correction with Friday's move? If yes, is it short term for mostly next 1-2 weeks, or are you bullish through the new year?\n\nTimeframes we're interested in are:\n\n* Next week.\n* Next ~40 days heading into the election, and the ~2 weeks following it.\n* Jan 2021 and further.\n\nRecent catalyst topics:\n\n* Vaccine news (J&amp;J Phase 3).\n* Stimmy round 2 news (bill passing/almost ready in House).\n* Florida &amp; others reopening fully.\n* Europe lockdowns 2: wave 2 boogaloo.\n* Azerbaijan/Armenia conflict.\n\nLonger-term bullish reasons:\n\n* Stonks only go up (inflation, low-interest-rates driving money to equities).\n* Sector-based 'rona advantages, like QQQ and SPY.\n* Money on the sidelines since March.\n* Further DXY drops fueling equity \"growth\".\n\nLonger-term bearish reasons:\n\n* Corona never went anywhere and all signs point us to being headed into tougher months.\n* Extremely overvalued valuations (e.g. P/E ratios).\n* Civil unrest (mainly U.S., but also Belarus and others).\n\nPositions:\n\n* 401k - Bonds (account doesn't have cash option), re-balanced in Feb. Should have re-balanced back into stocks; expensive lesson. But I am patient and I see further downside. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n* Roth - Various SPAC commons/warrants; I think these catch you a ban though, so shhh.\n* Robinhood - Blown up (on MGM, PCG, etc.); fuck their fills too, try something like ETrade/Fidelity and feel the difference instantly.\n* Others - VXX Dec 18 calls ($27, $30), SPXW puts (Oct 16/30, $3350, $3240, $3270), CMG Oct 16 puts ($1215, $1190), JNJ Jan 15 '21 $145 calls, PRPL shares and calls (didn't buy at the peak, so... have their mattress, am bullish), various other SPAC warrants and calls.\n\n\u2020 \"Bers/bulls r fuk\", \"stonks only go up\", \"green Monday\", etc.",

        "selftext": "Wall Street likes to snooze on tech companies they don't understand. Cloudflare ($NET) is one of them. \n\n**Here is what's not to like about the company:**   \nIt currently trades 25x its revenue.  In Q2, $NET  reported a quarterly revenue of $99m and a net profit of  -$25m (negative). The company's market cap is about $11b. Publicly traded rivals include Fastly and Zscaler, both of which are much larger and currently much more successful. \n\n**So what does Cloudfare do?**   \nGenerally speaking, NET makes websites really fast and really secure. Backers of this company include  Google and Microsoft. Both of these companies also use its services. \n\nI'm sure most of you have heard about DDoS attacks. Well, Cloudflare is really busy trying to stop them: It said earlier this year that it blocks 72b DDoS attacks *each day.* It also provides what's called a \"content distribution network,\" or CDN. CDN's help negate websites from bottle necking. CDNs can also improve the overall user experience by making everything faster. \n\nThe company provides both free and paid services. It also has a \"pay as you go\" model, but that's there mostly to convert them into its SaaS offering, where it captures 95% of its revenue. The free service mostly exists because it fuels the company's product, \"Network Flywheel;\" the more people who use Cloudflare, the more effective its services are. They do a lot of other things, and pretty much own the whole stack, but for those who want to explore further, and get more specifics, [I suggest reading this.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-raised-110m-from-fidelity-google-microsoft-baidu-and-qualcomm/) \n\n**So what's its current state?**   \nThe company currently provides services to 25m websites \u2014\u00a0a number that will continue to grow as many businesses are forced to go through so-called \"digital transformations\" as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\n**In the company's most recent earnings, Matthew Prince, CEO, said:** \"*We had a very strong quarter. Our Q2 revenue came in just shy of $100  million, up 48% year-over-year. We saw strength from our customers of  all sizes. We grew our large customer accounts, those paying us more  than $100,000 annually by 65% year-over-year. We also added nearly 7,000  new paying customers, bringing our total paying customer count to over  90,000. At the same time, we saw strong growth across our existing  customer base as they adopted more features of the Cloudflare platform.\"*\n\nPrince added that the effects of the pandemic have served as a boon to its business. And the company raised both its Q3 and annual guidance (though it's known to lowball its guidance). In 2019, $NET grew at a rate of about 50% each quarter. \n\nThey have been busy hiring new employees to meet demand; an unscientific check on LinkedIn reveals it currently has 257 openings. It also has a $50 price target from a lot of analysts. \n\n**What's next:**   \nAs we head into winter, more businesses will look to sell their goods, service, online as people bunker in to avoid catching the coronavirus. This change in consumer behavior will further accelerate its business. It's something I think Wall Street is snoozing on, especially with headlines that suggest you're twice as likely to die from COVID if you have the flu. \n\nAlso, unlike rivals such as Zscalar, Cloudflare is *significantly* easier to use for small to medium sized businesses (these aren't your mom and pop stores on Main Street; think businesses that generate $10m+ in revenue). \n\nImportantly, many people have experienced Spotify, Shopify, Reddit, Discord, Amazon, etc going down. And the headlines often suggest that it was a result of an outage or something by Cloudflare. [This recent headline from TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/cloudflare-dns-goes-down-taking-a-large-piece-of-the-internet-with-it/), for instance, reads: \"*Cloudflare DNS goes down, taking a large piece of the internet with it\"*\n\nBut think about it ... so much of the internet relies on Cloudflare that when it experiences an issue, much of the internet is shut down as a result. That's pretty insane. \n\n**TLDR:** Buy Cloudflare.",

        "selftext": " Found this [article](https://bankeronwheels.com/covid-19-investing-in-bear-market-crash-bottom/) and found it really helpful. Not saying that we're in a bear market, but these are principles we (new investors) should keep in mind all the time. Also it is not my article, all credit to [bankeronwheels.com](https://bankeronwheels.com/)\n\n1. Invest in Stocks gradually on the way down\n\nWhen and how to invest in stocks? If you have directly or indirectly prepared for a period of financial stress and have available cash you may consider starting investing when there is a market crash. A good strategy is to build rules and stick to them \u2014 either based on\u00a0**certain index levels, for example** S&amp;P 500 at 2700 invest 20% of savings, 2500 another 20% etc. or\u00a0**based on timing**\u00a0(slicing every few weeks since we have no clarity which way the market may go and when it will bottom out)\n\n2. Do not chase an upward trend in a bear market\n\nOne of the\u00a0**common mistakes**\u00a0we see is\u00a0**people chasing upward trends**\u00a0because of\u00a0**FOMO \u2014 Fear of Missing Out**\u00a0(when stock market recovers after a big crash for a few days giving hope of long term gains). It takes more courage to buy according to predefined rules which often means buying when everything is gloomy and stocks lose massively. Buy on days when stocks are massively sold not bought. In the long term it pays off. Do not be tempted by rebounds that may prove short-lived.\n\n3. Do not try to time the market\n\nEven the best investors struggle with market timing. In fact most hedge funds (even the most prestigious ones) made substantial losses in March\n\nThe market can turn rapidly both ways and while you may avoid some bad days\u00a0**avoiding just a few good days can be extremely detrimental to your long term performance**\u00a0as illustrated by a study done by Fidelity.\n\nAlso, it is extremely\u00a0**risky to use leverage since additional debt implies you must be correct on timing**\n\n4. Invest, do not speculate\n\nYou may not get spectacular 300\u2013400% returns overnight but your money will be relatively safe if you base your decisions on sound financial statements and diversify.\u00a0**ETFs**\u00a0(including\u00a0[**Bond ETFs**](https://bankeronwheels.com/best-etfs-in-2020/))\u00a0**are a great way to invest in indices without taking idiosyncratic risk**\u00a0(e.g. L\\*\\*\\*\\* Coffee dropped 80% in one day in March on uncovered fraud \u2014 as Warren Buffett says \u201cOnly when the tide goes out to do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked\u201d).\n\n**Ask yourself the question \u2014 am I more qualified than a professional investor**\u00a0to predict which industry player may outperform the rest of the market? Do I know how the landscape post-crisis will look like? Even if you suspect knowing first-order effects are you sure of the second and higher-order effect (to Nicholas Taleb\u2019s point).\n\n5. Avoid binary outcomes\n\nHow to invest in stocks to avoid drawdowns? Each crisis has its own most\u00a0**vulnerable industries where outcomes can be binary**\u00a0\u2014 in 2008 some Banks went out of business and as an investor, you may have lost everything. The Coronavirus crisis has other prime candidates for such outcomes,\u00a0**airlines**\u00a0can be nationalized and\u00a0**hotel**/**tourism**\u00a0industry players can go bankrupt should the distress last longer. You want to avoid these investments until there is more clarity on consumer confidence.\n\nSince these recover now you may think it was wise to invest at some point but the key is that you can\u2019t base the\u00a0**rightness of a decision bed on an outcome but on a probability it would occur**. And in March chances were high there would be lots of Airline Lehman Brothers (in fact, a lot materialized \u2014 LatAm, Virgin Australia, etc)\n\nSolution for how to invest in stocks avoiding binary outcomes: Choose Index Funds!\n\n6. Look for financially resilient firms\n\nIf you do invest in single names, do not believe blindly in potentially meaningless dividend yields based on past data unless it has been confirmed by the management after incorporating all the outlook related to Covid-19. Instead, look at\u00a0**balance sheets with low debt and build-in resilience (cash)**. These firms may outperform and even acquire weaker competitors in the current environment. Be cautious though, you can\u2019t predict the impact of post-Corona market on Business Models.\n\n7. Keep Some Cash\n\nRay Dalio now infamously said a few months ago that \u2018Cash is Trash\u2019. While he is one of the best thinkers in Finance the remark was badly timed. Even in the most conservative scenarios keep some reserves. This is primarily a health crisis and while an economic crisis unfolds having a safety net is paramount.\u00a0**Additional unforeseen** **tail risks always exist (think Oil Price crash or Trade War on top of Coronavirus etc.)**\n\n8. Diversify in other assets including currencies, commodities and high quality debt products\n\nIt is difficult to predict which countries may relatively outperform.\u00a0**Keep your portfolio diversified**\u00a0geographically (e.g. Asia, Europe, US) and product-wise potentially including commodities like Gold that may outperform in low real rates / high inflation environments. Consider very high-quality debt products ([**Treasuries or Investment Grade Debt Bond** ](https://bankeronwheels.com/best-etfs-in-2020/)[**ETFs**](https://bankeronwheels.com/best-etfs-in-2020/)).\u00a0[**Here** ](https://bankeronwheels.com/bond-etf-gold-etf-comparison/)is a good guide on how to protect your Stocks Portfolio.\n\n9. Stay informed but remain cautious\n\nKnowing how to invest in stocks is also about adjusting your strategies as there is more clarity about the outlook. But be very careful with financial experts and consensus \u2014\u00a0**when you see opinions converging usually something else will happen**\n\n10. Duration of the coronavirus pandemic is key\n\nThe risks are still skewed to the downside (it can take\u00a0[**significant time**](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/basics/past-pandemics.html)). While there is a discount to peak market values and positive catalysts may materialize (most pharmas are working on Coronavirus vaccines and mitigating drugs) the time it takes and the change of behavior will alter the markets significantly.\n\n**The impact on people\u2019s health even when cured and society at large is at this stage still uncertain. Stay safe and healthy!**",

If I enact a Market order to sell my stock, how much under the current price does Fidelity go to sell the stock? Conversely, if I put in a buy order, how do they decide how much to buy it for? I assume its all automatic under some computer software, but I would like to understand how that decision is made.\n\nAnother question I\u2019ve been pondering on, during a company's IPO, do they sell all their shares for a set price and then the price fluctuates?

        "selftext": "\n\nI started investing on June 2016. Back then I didn't know anything about investment in general. I just thought that as long as I buy stocks, they will continue to increase in value over time. I was pretty wrong. \n\nBack then I put in $1000 to try my luck, and over a couple months my account value increased to about $1500. I was stoke. I thought I got it and this game is just too easy to win. I withdrew all that to play with JNUG. I made another $1000. My head was over the moon because back then it was a pretty big deal, being in college and not making money.\n\nThen what happened? I lost it all to 3x leveraged ETFs and down $3000. The loss destroyed me. I thought I was never going to recover. And the funny thing is that, the whole time I was busy playing around with 3x ETF, I saw the single share of AMD steadily climbing (I bought it for shit and giggle because I thought AMD never gonna make it big). Looking back, had I just dump everything in AMD, I would be in a much better shape.\n\nSo I left whatever in my account as cash and didn't look back until August 2018, what was why my account flatted line for almost 2 years.\n\nIn August 2018 I tried my luck with investing again. This time I didn't waste time gambling, but rather doing some real investing. I selected reputable companies and famous brands. Then Sep 2018 hit and you already know what happened. The stock market tanked pretty hard until Dec 24th, 2018, which I called Bloody Christmas. Imagine waking up everyday to see my account in red, like my hard earned money evaporating into the air. \n\nExcept this time I did something different. I wasn't as hasty to sell off. I rebalanced my portfolio a bit and keep investing. Back then I had a decent job which can cover living cost and left me with a bit of saving for investment. I didn't sell everything and close my account. I left everything in there and see how it would work out because I do believe it will recover. And it did in 2019. In fact I've read that many investors regretted that they didn't invest heavier during 2019 due to fear of another recession. \n\nI recovered everything I've lost and made some extra profit just simply from buying and holding\n\nThen 2020 hit. I saw my accounts tanking just like before and this time I wasn't wavered. I continue to put in my paycheck every 2 weeks.\n\nMy account quickly recovered and steadily climbing until now.\n\n\n\nI made a screenshot so you guys can see my current standing. This is just RH, I also have an account with Fidelity, IRA with Charles Schwab, 401k, and HSA. But RH still hold most of my money, neatly 1/2 of my portfolio.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JzwVbwG\n\nLet's make 1 thing clear\n\nI'm NOT a stock genius. I'm not considered myself to be a student of Warren Buffet. I did zero fundamental/technical analysis. I just though very simply: hey, these companies are financially strong, they have products that make money, their names are familiar, and they continue to innovate, so...why not?\n\nI'm just lucky I guess.\n\nMy biggest positions are in AMD, NVDA, AAPL, MSFT. I've used all of their products and am also a computer enthusiast. \n\n\nThe rest are ETFs like QQQ, VTI, XLK, FTEC.\n\nI do have some positions in cloud computing but they aren't big.\n\nThe past few days have been hard but whatever. I know it will recover just like before. Tomorrow is pay day and I will continue to put more money into my portfolio. Over all my account is still positive. I mean, 55% increase in past year and 44% over all is good, right? I have no complain. This correction is just another day for me to buy cheap stocks that's all.",

        "selftext": "I have only bought options before; never sold.  So I'm a little confused about how this will go down.  My brokerage is Fidelity.\n\nI have 100 shares of MSFT that I have been hoping to sell at $229.  The price keeps getting close to my target but it never gets there so my order never executes.  So as an experiment, I decided I'd try selling a covered call for $230 instead of waiting for my order to execute.  That way I can earn a little premium while I wait.  So I sold a -MSFT201009C230 contract for $9.75.  All seems good.\n\nHowever, I'm confused by how this is going to go when the option is eventually exercised (I am hoping it will be exercised because I want to exit the position).  Fidelity does not seem to show anything \"linking\" the CC to my long shares, so I am assuming that it won't automatically liquidate the shares for me and that I'll have to do it manually? Is that correct?\n\nIt seems like I have a bunch of sales it might be hard to keep track of which shares are being used for covered calls and which are my LTBH positions.  Is there any way to set it up to auto-liquidate the 100 shares so that I can keep track automatically?\n\nAutomatic selling would also ensure that if the price drops while I'm not watching, it can be sold at the strike price rather than whatever the price is once I get to a place where I can set-up the trade.  Or should I just put in a limit order to sell it at the strike price right now?  Will that mess anything up?\n\nTIA!",

        "selftext": "I finally dumped my ML financial advisor. I had over 5 million with him but he wasn\u2019t performing well and my fees were 1 percent in internal fees plus the investments he chose had fees that were too high. i complained and he lowered my fees to .8% but still my investments had heavy fees. He claimed that the lowest he could go w ML fees was .7.  So why only lower mine to .8?  He also had me open up a ML edge account but only put 50k in for me to invest with absolutely no guidance from him he said once I get used to investing and learn how then he could move some more over. WTF. So I spoke with vanguard and fidelity and I decided to do self-directed at fidelity because there is an office nearby and they give you guidance and help with your portfolio 4x a year. If I want managed I will switch over to vanguard who will do it for .3 percent. Both guys I spoke with were such better options than the ML advisor who was a complete dick when I told him I am moving my accounts. I was such a fool. I explained to the ML advisor that the monthly fees (internal) that I pay ML are almost the same as my mortgage payment. I don\u2019t have a high paying job and it does not make sense at my level of wealth to give them this money. He was so nasty about it. Question- who goes to these guys? I know I was a fool but when there is Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab or evening Chase Private Client that is still way more reasonable then why do people give money to Merrill Lynch?",

        "selftext": "Square shares are up 146% in 2020 so far, and analysts at Oppenheimer think the stock can still go higher.\n\nOn Thursday, Oppenheimer upgraded Square ([SQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ?p=SQ&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) to outperform, with a price target of $185. (The all-time high was $166 on Sept. 1; shares were trading at around $152 on Thursday afternoon.) The upgrade is based on the growth of Square\u2019s Cash App, and on the company\u2019s opportunity to help merchants transition to e-commerce.\n\nBut really, the note is a post-pandemic vote of confidence.\n\nAs Oppenheimer writes, the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated a \u201cmassive shift in digital commerce, requiring merchants to rapidly adopt omni-channel solutions.\u201d Of course, it was already obvious before the pandemic that the retail landscape was barreling toward e-commerce, but the pandemic has sent the trend into hyperdrive. [Walmart, Target, and Best Buy reported enormous surges](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-and-target-huge-ecommerce-gains-are-a-blaring-siren-to-brickandmortar-retail-192709224.html) (100%+) in digital sales in Q2; online-only retailers [Etsy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etsy-ceo-on-huge-q-2-etsy-is-becoming-much-more-mainstream-181632322.html) and [Wayfair](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wayfair-stock-is-up-250-this-year-193131685.html) blew out their Q2 earnings; [Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods is thriving](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-is-wildly-outperforming-amid-the-pandemic-195504143.html) thanks to a combination of online sales and curbside pickup.\n\nAll of those are big retail names. Square\u2019s bread and butter are SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses), which also need to immediately prioritize their e-commerce presence, if they didn\u2019t already. Hundreds of thousands of small business have shut down due to the pandemic, but those that have survived will need to beef up their digital presence.\n\nOppenheimer believes Square is well-suited to serve those small businesses coming out of the pandemic, positioning Square \u201cfor outsized share gains as economic activity normalizes.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer pegs Square\u2019s TAM (total addressable market, [the \u201cit\u201d tech stat of the moment](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-cannabis-and-fake-meat-have-in-common-right-now-180741286.html)) at $160 billion, and within that, puts Cash App\u2019s TAM at $63 billion, noting that \u201cby reinvesting profits from prior Cash App cohorts, combined with its seller ecosystem, Square can develop significant network effects and products that will be challenging for other neo-banks to replicate in the digital wallet space.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Square has an advantage over banks in the mobile payments race.\n\nOppenheimer also notes the \u201cimpressive volume and gross profit growth\u201d of Cash App\u2019s bitcoin trading feature. Square [enabled bitcoin trading within Cash App in 2018](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-square-embrace-bitcoin-brilliant-182530364.html). It reaped $875 million in bitcoin revenue in the second quarter, up 600% year over year, and $17 million in bitcoin gross profit, up 711% year over year. ($17 million is small for a company with $4.17 billion in revenue in 2019, but the growth is the point.) Oppenheimer cites the growth in bitcoin revenue as proof of \u201cthe scalability in the Cash App business model.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has been a noted (and [some believe problematic](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorseys-love-of-bitcoin-could-be-a-problem-for-square-122742500.html)) obsession of CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nSquare has always touted that it serves both sides of the small business equation: sellers (i.e., businesses, through its point of sale hardware, payroll software, and Square Capital loan business) and shoppers (consumers paying with Square devices and/or using Cash App). Oppenheimer writes that this \u201ctwo-sided network\u201d will make Square \u201ca structural winner during the recovery.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s an obvious downside case against Square: \u201cEconomic pressures persist longer than anticipated\u201d if the pandemic drags on or even worsens, hitting small businesses harder; \u201ccompetitive responses dampen growth,\u201d and Square certainly has big competitors, including FIS (which acquired Worldpay last year), PayPal, ShopKeep, and Shopify; and if \u201cnew product launches and adoption slow,\u201d which will be up to Dorsey and Square\u2019s own pace of innovation.\n\nOppenheimer sees Square profit growing at a 37% annual rate from the end of 2020 through the end of 2022. Square was [Yahoo Finance\u2019s Company of the Year in 2018](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-yahoo-finances-2018-company-133124167.html).\n\n\u2014\n\n**Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers fintech and payments.

I expect my company to be acquired over the next 24-36 mos by a F500 org and have a nice upside should that stay on track. I also own two small businesses outside of \"real job.\" 20k cash in savings.\n\n\\~250k in Rollover IRA from a previous company (90% in a Fidelity date fund set at 2060 date for more aggressive nature and 10% in AAPL and 3 cannabis stocks) - my current company doesn't have a 401k so really just optimizing this IRA.\n\nStarted a Roth IRA for myself and my wife and have contributed the max to both for 2020. Using these for contributions for retirement.\n\n50k in accessible funds that are focused on AAPL, 5 cannabis stocks, LUV, and a few renewable energy ETFs and a small position in TSLA. The goal would be to keep this in something that is moving vs. dumping to a savings account (in order to keep it accessible)\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. Taking profits - I bought TSLA at the 20% drop last week and it's up 31% as of today. It's only 4 shares so does it make sense to sell a share and drop that into SPY/VOO and let the rest ride? Same with other stocks? I am in AAPL at $34/share (\\~200 shares)...take all of those profits and drop into SPY/VOO? I hear so many stories of \"my dad's cousin bought AAPL 15 years ago and is sitting on a million bucks.\" While I want to be that guy, I don't want to lose out should they shit the bed, etc.\n2. DCA - Does it make sense to sell the entire IRA and drop into SPY/VOO over the next few months or stay put?\n\nAny other advice?",
