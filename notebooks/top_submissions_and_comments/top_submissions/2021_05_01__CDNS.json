But they are still more valuable than other CDNs like Fastly and Cloudflare. \n\nThey have a new CEO.\n\nOnce the Olympics start streaming, I believe Limelight Networks will see a pop.\n\nTicker: LLNW / $LLNW\n\nWith how cheap they are at the moment (400million market cap, was over a billion not long ago), there is also the chance they get acquired.",
