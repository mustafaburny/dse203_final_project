        "selftext": "$SRNA (ancillary weed stonk, the last mention here was a month ago that I could find)\n\nSurna (SRNA) is one of the most underrated, undervalued, and under the radar cannabis stocks in history. Here\u2019s why:  \n\n\nSurna designs, engineers, and sells climate control systems for cannabis grow facilities all over the world. This includes HVACD, Air handling/sanitation, biosecurity, and automation controls. Now, you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cwhy should I care about a company that makes equipment for growers? I just care about the actual growers that sell the cannabis.\u201d That\u2019s fair, but here is why you should care\u2026  \n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of CGC APH, ACB, TLRY, CRON, FIRE / SPRWF, etc., if you are an investor in the cannabis space. Now\u2026 What do these companies all have in common, besides the fact that they all grow weed? Let\u2019s break it down:  \n\n\nThese companies aim to grow the most weed for the least amount of money  \n\n\nThese companies aim to grow the highest quality weed for the least amount of money  \n\n\nAs more states in the US and more countries legalize cannabis, competition will increase, and prices will go down. This means the company that grows the best weed and has the best margins (lowest cost per gram) will survive and thrive.  \n\n\nThese 3 points are exactly why you should care about Surna and why Surna is one of the most important company\u2019s in this entire industry. You might be thinking \u201ccouldn\u2019t any big HVAC company do what Surna is doing?\u201d Maybe, but they are far behind Surna.  \n\n\nWould you rather hire a company to design and build your grow facility because they\u2019re a big company, but haven\u2019t done this before? Or would you hire a company that has designed and built hundred upon hundreds of cannabis grow facilities, because that is all they do? You would choose the second **option**, and that is why Surna is so important.  \n\n\nNow, let\u2019s look a little deeper into Surna:  \n\n\nSurna has been in the business for over 14 years. The company was founded by Stephen and Brandy Keen, a husband and wife that had a passion for growing weed. Stephen designed a lot of his own equipment that was specific to cannabis. They grew the company into a million dollar revenue generating business, but when the company outgrew them, it was time for them to pass the torch.  \n\n\nUnable to control costs and turn a profit, and unable to handle the growth of the business, several management changes have led us to the NEW Surna, with Tony Mcdonald at the helm.  \n\n\nTony is a Harvard and West Point graduate, with many years of experience in the HVAC sector. He built a company called Coolerado, which was acquired by Seeley International, one of the largest HVAC companies in the world. After Tony worked at Seeley, he returned to his roots.  \n\n\nTony joined Surna as a director, and later became president and CEO. Tony rebuilt the company from the ground up and turned it into a lean, organized, and quality operation, with the vision of growing Surna like he did Coolerado, but with a twist \u2013 A technology and engineering company specializing in every facet of the cannabis grow facility.  \n\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers:  \n\n\nTony had taken control of Surna late 2018 into 2019. Here are the numbers for 2019:  \n\n\nQ1 Rev. - $1.7mil  \n\n\nQ2 Rev. - $4.2mil  \n\n\nQ3 Rev. - $5.5mil  \n\n\nQ4 Rev. - $3.3mil  \n\n\nSurna posted a profit in 2 of the 4 quarters in 2019. Considering Surna has never turned a profit until 2019, this is a big deal. Surna landed bigger and bigger contracts, and as more states legalize cannabis, and the regulatory landscape becomes more favorable to growers, this will allow growers to more quickly build and finance their operations, which will lead to Surna\u2019s revenue growth and consistency.  \n\n\nBelow are the numbers so far for 2020. We all know what happened in 2020. It was ugly for everyone. Surna\u2019s 2020 numbers are no exception, but what we do see here is something very interesting:  \n\n\nQ1 Rev. - $1.8mil  \n\n\nQ2 Rev. - $1.7mil  \n\n\nQ3 Rev. - $1.6mil  \n\n\nQ4 Rev. \u2013 TBA  \n\n\nDuring 2020, because of the pandemic, a lot of growers delayed or straight up cancelled their builds, which means Surna lost contracts and revenue. Surna, for most of 2020, generated little backlog and even lost backlog. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 Even in this worst case scenario environment, Surna generated at least $1.5mil every single quarter, and INCREASED their cash position to over $2mil by Q3 2020 even when they were losing money per quarter and without ANY dilutive financing. This is evidence of disciplined cash management and sales execution, even in a terrible environment. Tony steered the ship through uncharted waters and came out stronger than ever.  \n\n\nNow, once the pandemic began to slowly subside, Surna showed its resilience \u2013 They signed a record breaking $2.8mil contract, and 6 months later, signed an even bigger $3.2mil contract. This doesn\u2019t include the typical smaller contracts they land and don\u2019t disclose. Now, think about what happens when you add in these small contracts to the whale contracts they just landed, which will only become more common as the cannabis landscape becomes more favorable.  \n\n\nSo\u2026 Here we are. The beginning of 2021. Surna is about to announce their Q4 earnings, which will include their first $2.8mil contract. This means Q4 will be have at least $2.8mil in revenue. Now, if we assume Surna recognized another typical $1.5mil from their smaller contracts, then Q4 should be at least $4mil, which is pre-covid revenue. We also have the feds talking about full legalization, and as of this writing, New Jersey just officially legalized cannabis.  \n\n\nIn 2019 Surna generated $15mil in revenue. As of today they have over $8mil in backlog, NOT including the recent $3.2mil contract they just landed.  \n\n\nAs of today Surna\u2019s stock price is $.1124. Their market cap is around $26mil. Surna typically trades around 1-2x their annual revenue, which is a lot smaller multiple than almost every other cannabis company, that trade between 5 \u2013 25x their revenue.  \n\n\nBecause Surna is not \u201csexy\u201d and doesn\u2019t grow cannabis, and doesn\u2019t post a lot of PR\u2019s, they are under the radar and unknown to investors. As Surna posts more contracts and revenue growth, they will be recognized and trade at the same multiples as everyone else. With Federal legalization looming and more states legalizing cannabis, Surna\u2019s revenue streams will grow.  \n\n\nTo take it a step further, legalization will mean the big boys will want a piece. These companies don\u2019t start from scratch when entering a sector, they buy smaller companies to quickly gain market share. This makes Surna an acquisition target, or even a company that will acquire smaller companies.  \n\n\nMy price target for Surna in 2021 is $1.00. \n\nI am not a financial advisor and I do own this stonk.",

        "selftext": "TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1ubpfxize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d58b12644e9688e15e35e907386b910b9d938d\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**\n\n Add'l edit for those who can't read good - \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 ",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

Fixed, and added a bit more data\n\nEDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",

        "selftext": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much on this front. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.

        "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nKE is a leading integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services in China. They are a pioneer in building the industry infrastructure and standards in China to reinvent how service providers and housing customers efficiently navigate and consummate housing transactions, ranging from existing and new home sales, home rentals, to home renovation, real estate financial solutions and other solutions.\n\nMore general info about KE:\n\n[https://investors.ke.com/about-us/default.aspx](https://investors.ke.com/about-us/default.aspx)\n\n**The business**\n\nThe industry KE is operating in is Real Estate. The company was founded in 2001 in China. They have more then 85k employees. \n\nSome highlights about KE:\n\n\u00b7  Massive housing market in China with low efficiency in housing transactions and services.\n\n\u00b7  The operating system, Agent Cooperation Network (CAN), has been transforming the housing transactions and services industry in China. \n\n\u00b7  They utilize new technologies, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, big data and Internet-of-Things to create and develop real-life use cases and applications to enhance customer experience and service efficiency.\n\n\u00b7  Visionary management team with proven track record of innovations and execution.\n\nThe vision and mission statement:\n\nWe founded our company with the belief that we can transform the housing transactions and services industry in China by improving the quality, efficiency of service providers and enhancing customer experience.\n\nWe aspire to provide comprehensive and trusted housing services through our online and offline platform, to 300 million families.\n\nWow\u2026 300 million families.\n\n**Management**\n\nThe CEO of the company is Peng Yongdong. He is one of the co-founders of the company. Before he was a senior consultant of strategy and revolution at IBM.\n\nFor the other members of the executive team: [https://investors.ke.com/governance/executive-management/default.aspx](https://investors.ke.com/governance/executive-management/default.aspx)\n\n**Business highlights Q3 (non audited)**\n\n* Gross transaction value (GTV)\u00a0was US$154.6 billion, an increase of 87.2% year-over-year.\u00a0GTV of existing home transactions\u00a0was US$84.8 billion, an increase of 71.8% year-over-year.\u00a0GTV of new home transactions\u00a0was US$62.0 billion, an increase of 105.7% year-over-year.\u00a0GTV of emerging and other services\u00a0was US$7.8 billion, an increase of 151.5% year-over-year.\n* Net revenues were US$3.0 billion, an increase of 70.9% year-over-year.\n* Net income\u00a0was US$11 million.\u00a0Adjusted net income was US$274 million, an increase of 210.6% year-over-year.\n* Number of stores\u00a0was 44,883 as of September 30, 2020, a 41.7% increase year-over-year.\n* Number of agents\u00a0was 477,810 as of September 30, 2020, a 50.7% increase year-over-year.\n* Mobile monthly active users (MAU)\u00a0averaged47.9 million, an increase of 82.1% year-over-year.\n\nNotice the increase\u2026 Incredible. They expect for Q4 an increase of app. 33,5% to 40,5% compared to the same quarter in 2019.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nThe main shareholder is Hui Zuo with 46,8% of the shares. He is the founder and the Chairman of the Board. Second greatest shareholder is Tencent Holdings Limited. Tencent provides services to KE in connection to various aspects of the operations. We all know that Tencent is doing great. The CEO Peng Yongdong also has 3,6% of the shares.\n\nIn August 2020 KE went public on the NYSE. Current market price is approx. $63.\n\n**Market opportunities**\n\nAccording to the CIC Report, China has the largest housing market in the world in terms of GTV and number of transactions of existing and new home sales and home rentals in 2019. After a period of significant growth, the market is expected to enter an era of steady growth. It is expected that the existing home transactions market will gain more importance and grow with a CAGR of 12.4%.\n\n**Risk factors (highlights)**\n\n\u00b7  The business is susceptible to fluctuations in China's residential real estate market and is subject to government regulations.\n\n\u00b7  If they fail to maintain relationships with real estate developers or attract them to engage them, or otherwise fail to procure new real estate property listings at favorable terms, the business and growth prospects may suffer.\n\n\u00b7  If they fail to obtain or keep licenses, permits or approvals applicable to the various services provided by them, they may incur significant financial penalties and other government sanctions.\n\n\u00b7  Competition from other industry players. They may lose market share and customers if they fail to compete effectively. Their greatest competitor is E-House. Alibaba has a large stake (&gt;10%) in E-House.\n\nSEC Filing F-1: [https://investors.ke.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14285443](https://investors.ke.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14285443)\n\n**Own opinion**\n\nKE is a long-term investment for me. They have a great growth potential. I really like the real estate sector, especially in such a large company like China, Also,  I started this DD some days ago. Today I read that ARK Invest also has invested in KE. And let\u2019s be honest; everything Cathie touches turns into gold.",

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer - I am just a retard w/ a keyboard and you should do your own $DD. Also the karma whores @ WSB keep deleting my shit so one of you go post over there if you like $BB and what you read*\n\nTOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8x0sjsj4wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc0b996f191f3f47d37bb6b2888f537c6789ae0e\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW yesterday to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7cepei5wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7308c115e3d45a072dac92b20ac029eb132b348\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s89num7wxe61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5361754f68b831f3ad044aba2fed88c6f93c7849\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**",
