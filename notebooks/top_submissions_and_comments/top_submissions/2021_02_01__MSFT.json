        "selftext": "In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term\n\n\\~Very Long Post\\~ \\[Do NOT Read if you don't like comprehensive analysis\\]\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies. They are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, these are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good financials, with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "AMD was another stock targeted in Robinhood's restricted stock list late last week. This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.\n\nRobinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.\n\nThere are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))\n\nAlong with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.\n\nAMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.\n\nThe one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.\n\nHope this is all helpful!  \n\nDisclosure: I own 30 shares of AMD and will continue to hold for the years to come.",

        "selftext": " Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)\n\n*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCorsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.\n\nThey acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.\n\nCorsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.\n\nUnderstanding the Business\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\nCorsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.\n\n**Revenue Streams**\n\nCurrently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.\n\nGamer and Creator Peripherals:\n\nwhich represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.\n\nGaming Components Systems:\n\nwhich represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.\n\nAcquisitions and Partnerships:\n\nDuring 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.\n\nIndustry\n\n**Market Size**\n\nAccording to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nGrowth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.\n\nPopularity of gaming is increasing:\n\nAccording to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTech-driven improvements in game quality:\n\nAdvances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.\n\nIncreasing gaming and streaming engagement:\n\nSome interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks\u2019 State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:\n\n* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games\n* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves\n* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive\n* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.\n\n**The eSports and streaming flywheel**\n\nThe rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.\n\nCompetitive Landscape &amp; Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players. They are in my opinion the leading pc peripherals brand for gamers.

        "selftext": "MODS: THIS IS IMPORTANT, PLEASE DON'T REMOVE\n\nSo far, many of you have seen and heard about the ladder attacks that have been happening with GME recently. What if I tell you that \"short interest is going down\" is the result of shorts unwinding their previous ladder attacks?\n\nLet me explain:\n\nToday, I saw something very strange on Webull. I saw shares of GME being traded in L2 data for \\~$14, \\~20$, and around \\~$30. I managed to take a screenshot from one of these sales and in order to make sure that something is very wrong, I made a limit buy order at $30 before it happened again. The order obviously didn't get filled:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[L2 Time &amp; Sales Data \\/ removed my other limit orders](https://preview.redd.it/lmjh2m5bn0f61.png?width=2732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5745279c389cb4101b55f1b9771f776263a2138b)\n\nAt first, I thought this might be a glitch, but after thinking about it more, it clicked! I've been following GME for months, the key is within why these prices were chosen ($14, $20, $30)! Folks who've been following GME closely know that GME broke $14 for the first time after the Microsoft deal. Both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for GME's price.\n\nSo why are we seeing these prices again today? I have a theory! Short sellers were having ladder attacks back then, but the way they probably did them was the following:\n\nLet's say hedgefund A and hedgefund B are colluding to bring the price down. Since there are no shares available to borrow, A buys 1000 shares and lends them to B. B then shorts those shares but makes sure that A is the one buying them. A lends these shares to B again and B shorts them again. This continues until the price gets down to the desired level. This artificially increases the short interest of GME, but in reality, only 1000 shares have been changing hands. If you look carefully, you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices.\n\nHere is the thing: these short-sellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created! The fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest \"in theory\" seems to be going down also proves this! I'm baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks! They are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point!\n\nNow you might ask \"what if all of the short interest is artificial?\", the answer is an obvious no! Why do you ask? because if they didn't have massive short positions, they wouldn't have to do these ladder attacks, to begin with!\n\nHow do I know (or rather guess) that the actual short interest hasn't gone down by a lot? 2 reasons:\n\n1. The stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages (AFAIK)\n2. The following screenshot shows that there are only %15.9 of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than today's closing price, which would be around  11.09m shares:\n\n[Position Cost Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/n0okmsbug0f61.jpg?width=1493&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c8638cfede5177ba9e87107aa1f93dd8e20494c)\n\nAs you know, today's closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and Friday, which means one thing: There are AT MOST 11.09m shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands! So the short interest AT MOST has gone down by (0.159\\*69.75m=) 11.09m in the past two days (unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them, which seems unlikely to me since I haven't seen any SEC filings from institutions)!\n\nWhat I do not know is this: do these short-sellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of \"short selling\" or not! My guess is that they don't, because:\n\n1. They are probably scared of getting caught!\n\n2. Another reason why I think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for GME has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case (when they are using these type of ladder attack, the estimates are probably higher than reality, and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower).\n\n3. I think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks!\n\nAlso, note that shorts don't have to \"borrow and sell\" to each other to create a ladder, they can just \"buy and sell\" from each other. However, I think they've done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates!\n\nBased on this evidence, I believe that the squeeze has not squoze! This also suggests that short-sellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal!\n\n**Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares.**\n\nHopefully, SEC will take a close look at what these short-sellers are doing, but given that it seems like this has been going on for a while, I doubt that anyone will do anything about this!",

        "selftext": " \n\nCorsair Gaming ($CRSR)\n\n*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCorsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.\n\nThey acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.\n\nCorsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.\n\nUnderstanding the Business\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\nCorsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.\n\n**Revenue Streams**\n\nCurrently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.\n\nGamer and Creator Peripherals:\n\nwhich represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.\n\nGaming Components Systems:\n\nwhich represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.\n\nAcquisitions and Partnerships:\n\nDuring 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.\n\nIndustry\n\n**Market Size**\n\nAccording to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nGrowth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.\n\nPopularity of gaming is increasing:\n\nAccording to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTech-driven improvements in game quality:\n\nAdvances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.\n\nIncreasing gaming and streaming engagement:\n\nSome interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks\u2019 State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:\n\n* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games\n* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves\n* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive\n* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.\n\n**The eSports and streaming flywheel**\n\nThe rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.\n\nCompetitive Landscape &amp; Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players.

        "selftext": "TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking.

IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me.

If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP.

Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.\n\nI am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.\n\n**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**\n\nI think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.\n\nYou know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. \n\nNote: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.\n\n**Microsoft revenue sharing**\n\nGME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?\n\n**PC building kiosk**\n\nKnow microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:\n\n\\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently\n\n\\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get \ud83d\ude80. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.\n\n\\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.\n\nPosition GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.\n\nWhat about the squeeze?",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "First of all I would like to explain my current position and how I've played this stock so far.\n\nAfter getting burned on call options in early december i decided to just go with shares. I doubled down after hearing the news that Cohen increased his stake to 13%. My average cost was $17. My price target was $75 so I cut my position in half there, and took some additional profits above $150. I'm still holding 5 shares though and I just bought more around $75.\n\n$75 is fair value before the media hype came. Now with all the enthusiasm around this company I can see $150 being a good value. And possibly higher than that when they report sky high earnings next month. \n\n\nAnyway, now that this thing is at down to earth levels, we can begin discussing the actual business, not just the share price. So here is a list of bullish factors that could push this thing up:\n\n1.) New consoles.\n\n\nGamestop wasn't supposed to still be alive by this point. The very fact they are still alive with a big retail footprint will ensure they at least stay alive for awhile. Also, there was speculation that the new consoles would not have disk drives, but the new Xbox will has a disk drive, and there are diskdrives on ps5s as well (although they also make a model without a disk drive)\n\n\n2.) Deal with Microsoft\n\n\nThe gist of the deal is that they will receive 5% of the revenue from sales on the Microsoft store on every Xbox sold by Gamestop. It's a gimmick by Microsoft to incentivize them to drum up more sales. The fact these consoles are flying off the shelves faster than they can be stocked means that the impact of the Microsoft deal will be as big as possible. It will be a great digital revenue stream for the company going forward. \n\n\n3.) Lockdowns turbo charging popularity of gaming. \n\n\nWith people stuck at home with nothing to do, more people are playing video games than ever before. And despite the rise in digital downloads, a lot of people still like to have a physical copy. \n\n\n4.) $800million cash on the books\n\nYou can see why most of the heavily shorted stocks on the market are shorted as much as they are. Usually these companies are ass deep in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy. This is not the case with Gamestop. They have $800million on the books and they already payed off a large chunk of their debt early. They could literally do stock buybacks and shorten the supply even further. In fact last ER when asked if they would do more buybacks the Ceo said \"it's not off the table.\"\n\n5.) $100million shelf offering\n\nNow I was pissed off about this at the time slightly because it caused my calls to go to hell but in hindsight this was a 4d chess move. They filed for a $100m shelf offering back in early December. This allows them to sell $100m worth of shares whenever they'd like. So since this little squeezeroo happened here, that's like a drop in the hat. It would probably barely move the stock. \n\nAnyway, they probably don't need to do this unless they are planning something big, but either way it gives them more finance options going forward. \n\n\n\n6.) Ryan Cohen\n\nRyan Cohen has upped his stake in Gamestop to over 13%. They reached an agreement, and now Ryan Cohen and several of the other former Chewy executives are on the board. Chewy, the company that Cohen cofounded, is an wildly successful online pet supply store that took on Amazon head to head and won. They got bought out by Petsmart and currently have a market cap of $42billion. \n\nIf Cohen and friends can turn the company around, there is a path to $1,000 a share being a fair value. I mean, we'll see what happens, but there is a path. \n\n\n7.) Media hype\n\nThis has to be the first time I can remember Gamestop actually getting some positive PR. The widespread media coverage is like a free $hundred million marketing campaign. A lot of people probably thought of Gamestop as the shitty company that gave you bad deals on games. But now the narrative has been reframed. I think a lot of people are seeing them as the underdog, the struggling company getting pissed and spat on by wallstreet billionaires.\n\nAnd to a lot of people Gamestop kind of represents more than just a \"next blockbuster.\" The hedgefunds tearing down gamestop is like them tearing down a piece of our childhood. I don't know about you, but I still love going and buying old games at gamestop once in awhile. Although certain things I don't have much of a choice on, I try to give them as much business as possible.\n\n\nEdit: \n\nAdditional factors to keep in mind:\n\n1.) At the end of 2018, the company bought back 37% of the existing shares on the market. I would have to do a deeper dive to see what the market cap has been over time. But essentially, $75 in todays shares is a drop in the hat. Sure it hasn't been this high since 2007, but there also wasn't a share shortage in 07. This is what makes the company such a unique play. I think it was around that time when u/deepfuckingvalue got involved. This is a big reason the shorts are having a hard time covering. \n\n\nEdit 2: \n\n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83e\udd21's please fuck off with your FUD bullshit. HOLD!",

Look at this fucking chart. I don\u2019t need to run a regression, let\u2019s be just as retarded as all the candle-stick reading dipshits with a Bloomberg terminal (*#Ben Graham GANG# FOREVER AND ALWAYS)* \\- Look at the lines, and how they\u2019re moving together. Try to wrinkle that smooth brain of yours for a second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kf5jctzfa4f61.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5748958438ce497898a3701dfb76b33779fd8f54\n\n**Why THE FUCK would an (a) Endpoint / digital security company, a vidya retailer (yeah, sure they sell funko pops too now great ), a movie chain (half of you morons have 3 streaming subscriptions and last I checked you\u2019re not allowed to watch in your underwear while getting tendie crumbs everywhere @ AMC), and some Fininsh 5(g) provider (I don\u2019t know a fucking thing about NOK) move in tandem other than just being meme stocks on this fucking board?**\n\nBy the way - There's been a ton of great technical analysis posted on the others in $BANG. the short squeeze on GME was real and a once-in-a-lifetime catch and i respect the hell out of it (and am also a sad bagholder of a few shares). It's just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.\n\nFor better or worse - There was a post, I can\u2019t find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.\n\nAs you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife\u2019s boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -\n\n*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*\n\n*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*\n\nSo. Two things re: $BB\u2019s volatility.\n\n# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.\n\n# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.\n\n**It\u2019s called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.\n\n*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub. Satya Nadella daddy dicked earnings and the stock (along with the whole fucking market) was down\u2026Live by the retard, die by the retard. But look at the bounceback this this week, when all the hedge funds looked around and said \u2013 Wait, J. Powell is still printing money like Zimbabwe and stocks only go up.*\n\n***What do you think will happen once things calm down, the stimulus checks hit, and retail investors start looking around again for stocks they might like?***\n\nSo now what? Well, I REPEAT, **wrinkle that smooth brain of yours. What does #1 and #2 have to do with the** [actual reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) **that #BANG GANG likes $BB?**\n\nIf you said \u2013 \"Huh, not much\" then congrats you\u2019ve evolved slightly beyond a retarded monkey playing at a slot machine and shitting out sub-par memes.\n\n**TLDR - $BB WENT DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ITS STATUS AS A MEME STOCK. $BB $BANG GANG EATs WILD DAILY PRICE SWINGS FOR BREAKFAST. THE BIGGEST LESSON OF GME / AMC IS THAT RETARDS TOGETHER STRONG. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT ENOUGH RETARDS BELIEVE, IT EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO ROCKET AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.**\n\n**TLDR the TLDR - $BB #BANG GANG IS IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. WE\u2019RE TERRAFORMING MARS, AND TAKING MATT DAMON WITH US.**\n\nPOS \u2013 balls deep in $BB shares, planning to buy more today\n\nDisclaimer \u2013 I am not a financial advisor and retarded\n\nMandatory edit for kids who can't read good and want to learn how to do other things good too - \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

Nokia, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia\u2019s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&amp;T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. \n\n[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)\n\nNokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn\u2019t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won\u2019t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer\u2019s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.\n\nAt 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&amp;P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. \n\nWith that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ \n\nThe second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump\u2019s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don\u2019t think this is likely. But it\u2019s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&amp;D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.\n\nIt should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares. \n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2020-02-05 12:16:19\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-20-005972/](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-20-005972/) \n\nAnd the new one showing the increase.\n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2021-01-29 17:21:09\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-004596/](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-004596/)\n\nEven though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. \n\nNow you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. \n\nFinal words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

Think about that for sec... The guy who is responsible for Amazon's web services. Amazon IS fucking web services, well, it's also fulfilment of course. This is still retail we\u2019re talking about.\n\nJosh Krueger, new GameStop VP of Fulfillment formerly from Amazon, Walmart, QVC. I shouldn't need to tell you why this is a big move. Looks like the guy has literally been growing in the same exact fucking direction as the industry. Next in line for him, Gamestop\n\nKelli **MF** Durkin, new GameStop Sr VP of Customer Care, previously from CHEWY. Everything people love about Chewy that made it such a lovable brand comes from their customer service dpt. They'll leave the UXUI up to Matt and his team while Kelli\u2019s team keeps on making the customer\u2019s come back to buy more. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of good customer service. I\u2019ve straight up switched ISP\u2019s because of this.\n\nNow, combine this dream team, with the (un)expected possibility of Ryan Cohen becoming CEO. This really is some Avengers End Game shit.\n\nThis fucking super team could really turn GameStop into the one-stop-game-shop everything gaming related. I\u2019m talking build-a-pc centers with the next-gen GPU\u2019s/CPUs hitting exclusively GME first (re: fulfillment), online streaming community (aka Twitch/Amazon), sharing revenue on cloud-based game streaming platforms (like MSFT GamePass), combined with a dedication to their customer. **That\u2019s fucking YOU, YOU RETARD!**\n\nOkay, now for a very light amount of quantitative speculation. Imagine holding your current amount of shares, the stock eventually hits $400 and it splits 8:1. Now, with 8x more shares you slowly climb up to $1000. Maybe it splits again along the way, who fucking knows, you do the math. Yeah it\u2019s that same hypothetical math you\u2019ve been doing the past week only... 1x your current share amount. Kinda makes you want to get more shares.\n\nObligatory, I am most certainly a retard, so this is not advice so please don\u2019t listen to me. Only a fool on a rant.",

They priced a secondary offering from an insider lock up at $35, providing a strong floor (thus my short puts at $35.

        "selftext": "So I want to know why Ford is still trading at 11$. I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion.

Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!\n2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) \n3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)\n4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).\n5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet\n\nIt's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo.

        "selftext": "Sorry, this is a looonngg post and there are definitely parts you don't need to read like the intro and the NVAX. I just wanted to make sure it was detailed and explained everything as I'm sure this sub has been riddled with posts identical to this recently.\n\nSo to start this off I'll admit that I dived straight in with no prior knowledge of investing with GME, AMC and the most stupid, a little bit of Dogecoin. I'm still hoping AMC will recover at least a little when theatres re-open as I bought at $15 lol. I sold half my $400 GME off early (bought at $320) for about $10 profit or something tiny. I still have $200 and I'm still holding on. I'm aware that this might not be wise but luckily, the one non-stupid thing I did with this is that I used a certain percentage of my profits from beermoney ventures (surveys, market research and the like) as well as my matched betting which means, that whilst it was stupid and it is frustrating to lose both my own money and potential profit due to my own lack of research, I haven't risked anything I couldn't afford to lose.\n\nI'm getting older and busier so I don't always have time to be answering long and boring surveys anymore so I wanted to take the percentage of these profits and invest in relatively long term stocks. I've been doing some research and have purchased a couple of books and I've been looking into a variety of different stocks to start my portfolio. It's worth mentioning that I only have roughly $400-$500 to invest.\n\nThese are the shares I'm thinking/have already invested in:\n\n**NVAX:**\n\nCurrently, I have $50 that I got at $211.91 a share in NVAX. For those who don't know NVAX recently developed a Coronavirus vaccine that is 89% effective, whilst this is less than Pfizer and Moderna, Pfizer and Moderna are not backed up by clinical trials and most importantly, NVAX was 89% effective against both the original and the new mutated Coronavirus. I think this will do quite well.\n\n\n**AAPL:**\n\nThis is where the stocks I have end. AAPL is currenly at $135 which seems quite low and despite COVID, it has done really well financially. There is also mentioning of the Apple Car, Apple VR a new computer and it's increase in iPhone users this/last year. It seems like an obvious purchase but this is definitely where my lack of knowledge comes in. There have been all this stuff, huge revenues, new products and it's debt deal, yet over the past few days it's kinda stayed between $130 - $140 so I'm a bit uncertain on this one.\n\n**FUBO:**\n\nThis seems like it could do very well and there's loose speculation of it being worth $200 by the end of the year. That being said, the subscription revenue isn't particularly long-term, but then, they do have a new betting service. They report earnings on March 2. I was thinking of putting in a sell order at around at some price between $40-$50 but I'm very clearly not an expert so was hoping someone might have better insight. I'm thinking that personally, this is too risky for me either way but would be nice to hear some insight so I can learn what to look out for.\n\n**SQ**:\n\nThere was a bit of a dip in Square. They seem to be fundamentally quite strong since they cater to non-cash payments and for obvious reasons right now that seems pretty good. I think more importantly though, I don't want to go on about it but obviously a certain couple apps are in trouble and since CashApp now offers investing for a very similar user base it might increase. Like Apple this one seems obvious but then it's currently at $227. A optimistic look from investopedia says it'll go back up to $300. I assume there's a bit of a risk with that so with the risk and the fact that the optimistic increase would be from \\~$230 to $300 I feel that now I might be a bit late.\n\nThis is the end of a very long post and thanks for reading it. I understand that it's impossible to say you should go with this stock as it's 100% going to profit but I think some tips with these stocks that I mentioned and I guess just general advice for things to look for that I may have missed in my small analyses. I find that for some reason, I'm always reluctant to invest in the big'uns like Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft as in my head they're just expensive shares that don't change much which is obviously untrue and probably a mindset of an inexperienced investor. Also, I'm aware that even over the span of a few years \u00a3400 might not necessarily make me lots but I'm using this time to come to grips with it more so that when I have a bigger income I'm more experienced. Also, I feel it's worth adding that I am a computer science and electronics student and I imagine investing in things you know/are interested in is always a good thing but I don't really know how to start with just finding a good company to invest in that isn't at least being mentioned a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to update this with; I have been looking through Investopedia University, Khan Academy and have started reading Intelligent Investor. I just want to hopefully make it clear that on top of this post I am doing my own research and I hope people know that I'm not trying to just copy their decisions without any thought.\n\nEDIT 2: Removed crypto. Sorry I'm not replying to comments, they're not working atm so can only see bits of messages from phone notifications.",

        "selftext": "Information from Pixelcarve:\n\nQNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. \n\nSo what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can\u2019t bring it down.\n\nMicro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car \u2013 they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.\n\nThe benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency \u2013 this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI\u2019s to low-level 3D games.\n\nQNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it\u2019s a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform.",

        "selftext": "First Cobalt Corp. is a mining and production company of refined cobalt. \n\nFirst Cobalt has two main assets:\n\n1. They own the only permitted cobalt refinery in North America in Ontario, Canada\n2. The Iron Creek Project in Idaho, USA with cobalt present in the millions of pounds. \n\n**What is cobalt?**\n\nCobalt is a material used in the electrodes of batteries, allowing better charging capabilities and longer battery life. Cobalt is one of the primary ingredients used in everything from computer/phone batteries to EV batteries. \n\nSome companies have recently vowed to move away from Cobalt because 2/3rds of all Cobalt is currently mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has involved child slavery and human rights violations. A [lawsuit](http://iradvocates.org/sites/iradvocates.org/files/stamped%20-Complaint.pdf) has been filed against  Tesla, Apple, Alphabet, Dell, and Microsoft because of their use of cobalt mined from these mines. \n\nMoreover, China has something of a monopoly on cobalt supply lines and refinery processes, leading to a great deal of importation of their materials to the U.S. and Canada. \n\n*But* non-cobalt batteries are extremely hard to make, and companies are likely to continue to use cobalt in their batteries the foreseeable future. \n\n**This is where First Cobalt comes in**.\n\nFirst Cobalt's strategy \"is to explore, develop and refine ethically sourced cobalt\u00a0within\u00a0North America for sale back into the American battery market.\" \n\nWith Joe Biden's demand to pivot towards EV,  the democrats likely to demand ethical mining processes from here on out, and movement away from dependency on China, First Cobalt is poised to provide that demand immediately in the North American Market\n\nProduction metrics:\n\n1. First Cobalt will be able to refine 25,000 tons of cobalt a year once operating\n   1. Their refinement process has been tested and is efficient by global standards.\n   2.  Operating cost estimate of $2.72/lb of cobalt produced, which is competitive with global markets \n2. They have already laid down plans and began studies to expand the refinery by almost double in the next two years\n3. The Iron Creek Project has the potential to produce millions of pounds of refinable cobalt.\n\nMoving Forward: \n\nFirst Cobalt has yet to start production at its refinery or mining in Idaho. The refinery is 100% viable and ready to produce. The mining in Idaho is less secured as operations are awhile from starting, but their primary asset is still the refinery as a main touch-point for sales to battery makers. \n\nThey've also recently secured [10 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-mining-first-cobalt/first-cobalt-secures-c10-million-government-backing-for-canada-refinery-idUSKBN28Q2F4) from the Canadian government in December, and they've been restructuring their finances in recent months to better prepare them for expansion moving forward. \n\nTheir website is [here](https://www.firstcobalt.com/) if you want to take a look at the company yourself. Discuss and let me know what you all think?",

Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nGrowth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.\n\nPopularity of gaming is increasing:\n\nAccording to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTech-driven improvements in game quality:\n\nAdvances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.\n\nIncreasing gaming and streaming engagement:\n\nSome interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks\u2019 State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:\n\n* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games\n* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves\n* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive\n* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.\n\n**The eSports and streaming flywheel**\n\nThe rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.\n\nCompetitive Landscape &amp; Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players.

        "selftext": "Reddit (and social media in general) has, in my opinion, a very interesting mix of strategies and approaches when it comes to trading/investing. A good portion here are looking for short/medium term gains with mild risk. Some play it safer, investing in index funds and ETF\u2019s relying on long-term growth. Another percentage is looking to get rich quick, dumping their life savings into a single stock. \n\nI know the idea for a \u201cReddit ETF\u201d has been floated here before, and I personally believe that with the aforementioned mix of DD/risk tolerance, it would perform exceptionally well. With several users posting a weekly recap of the most discussed stocks, I have decided to pull 10 stocks from these lists and invest $150 in each of them, totaling $1,500 in this \u201cETF.\u201d The \u201cReddit ETF\u201d consists of the following. \n\n-ARKK\n-MSFT\n-AMZN\n-ICLN\n-SPCE\n-AAPL\n-PLTR\n-TSLA\n-BB\n-NOK\n\nAs much as I would love to invest more, I have a particularly small portfolio at the moment (life meant I had to pull most of my investments last year. Needed the money for immediate use). However, I do plan on contributing additional funds on a weekly basis to help grow. My questions for Reddit are as follows\n\n-Is 10 different stocks too many? Too few? \n\n-At what point should I drop or sell of an underperforming/less discussed stock? Should I reevaluate the stocks included in the ETF weekly? Monthly? \n\n-When investing additional cash, should I evenly divide my investment across all stocks (I.E. if putting in an additional $150, put $10 in each stock)? Or should additional investments favor the better performing stocks?\n\nI would love any feedback or suggestions! I plan on posting updates on a semi-regular basis (probably once or twice a month).\n\n-Sorry for the formatting issues, I\u2019m on mobile",

        "selftext": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much on this front. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players.

        "selftext": "I was thinking about examples of what Moore (Gorilla Game) calls tornadoes, and 3d-printers popped into my head. A tornado in his model is a new market, that develops into a crucial link the value chain of businesses. Alternatively it can be a \"better mouse trap\" that completely displaces another link in the chain, or even re-writes the entire value chain, like Netflix replacing Blockbuster. Having a conversation with a long time friend a while back, I was asking him about any good ideas for something small to send his kids, while they're basically stuck inside all day long. Imagine being a kid and being 6 or 7 right now. One entire year of your life has been spent in a weird bubble. 1/7 of your life. That would be like every Sunday of my life I couldn't go anywhere, or meet someone for coffee, or go grocery shopping. A sort of Shomar Shabbot, but death is a dice roll if you break the rules and the whole family rolls the dice if anyone cheats. It feels like it's the kind of thing that's going to define the worldview for a generation of children, for a while to come. I thought I could at least send them a bit of mail. I remember mail of any flavor being a fun event as a kid. Kid's don't get a lot of mail. We even got excited for travel brochures. The kind you send away for. The \"Come visit exciting Nebraska, we've got a corn maze. Get it, Maize! Haha. Please, somebody visit..\" travel brochures states departments of commerce or travel would send out if you asked. This was probably more of a thing back before the internet.\n\nMy friend replied that he's very into Lego's (big surprise, I knew this), and he likes building elaborate battles with his Legos and other toys. Orcs versus Legos versus Ninjas. That sort of thing. He had found a home 3d-printer setup at a decent price and kids were very excited to get what amounted to a homemade army-man printed off the machine to add to their epic battles. It didn't cost much and he could make his kid just about anything. An orc. A ninja. A giant squid. A giant squid-orc-ninja. This part of the equation I didn't know.\n\nThis got me thinking about 3d-printers and tornadoes. I don't know what industry this would disrupt specifically, when it reaches that last stage of innovation where it becomes more efficient for a person or small business to own a cheap 3d-printer to solve their needs, rather than order a specialized part from a company that might charge specialized-part-company prices. Even better, to replace a part on an old machine that was out of production or solve a problem that didn't have an already commercially available solution. There are already libraries full of blueprints available for download for all sorts of different solid state things a 3d-printer could make. Maybe it would disrupt a lot of industries in smaller R&amp;D or cost savings sorts of ways.\n\nI remember a news story earlier this year, of a kid who designed what amounted to a bobby-pin solution to the problem nurses and doctors were experiencing with their ears getting wrecked after 12 hours wearing masks all day in the ICU's. It wasn't remotely complicated, but it was ingenious. Looked like a little fish-bone piece if plastic that wrapped around the back of your head and had multiple spaced out tongs to hook the ear loop on each side. No more painful ears. He was printing them on a 3d-printer for his local hospital and couldn't print them fast enough. So he gave away the design and made a tutorial for other tinkerers to replicate it on their own 3d-printers. Smart kid. I was not nearly that ambitious at his age. I was throwing rocks and pieces of flotsam into big puddle, and doing wicked jumps off the 6 inch dirt \"hill\" in the field we neighborhood kids had decided was a BMX track. Dangerous times.\n\n3d printers are the sort of thing that has the opportunity to be a new category. I don't know what roadblocks still exist to mass adoption, but it seems like the price roadblock at least has been knocked down. A quick google search \"who makes 3d printers\" yielded a fascinating article with a lot of useful information. I didn't realize there were companies that had been involved in this for decades. Of course CNC machines have been around for a long time, but that is an industrial solution. Most people don't have a CNC machine in their garage, or the technical knowledge to use one. HP. ProtoLabs. Materialise. Stratasys. 3d Systems. ExOne. It's a long list, this article is packed with information.\n\nI don't know how to approach this, because I'm not an expert on 3d printers or emerging technology. If some of these companies have been around this long, it probably either isn't a winner-take-all industry or there is still some roadblock preventing mass adoption of the technology. So let's take a look at it from the simplest possible angle: Year over Year revenue increases.\n\nHP doesn't get factored, because HP is way too massive, I am way too lazy and this is just an example. Perhaps you could dig through a 10-k and find a break-out of the revenue from this segment, but I'm just going to skip that and look at the smaller companies, some 3d printer specialists.\n\nRevenues by year (*in thousands*, but this does not matter because we are comparing percentages)\n\n\" Proto Labs specializes in rapid prototyping using three additive  processes: stereolithography, selective laser sintering and direct metal  laser sintering. \"\n\nProto Labs (PRLB): 2019, 2018, ... \\[$458,728,  $445,596,  $344,490, $ 298,055  $ 264,106  $ 209,583 \\]\n\nYear-over-year Growth: 2019, 2018, ... \\[2.9%, 29.35%, 15.5%, 12.8%, 26%\\]\n\nMath: (458,728 - 445,596) /  445,596 = 0.029 (x100) = 2.9%\n\n\" Materialise has been providing software solutions and 3D printing services for over 25 years. \"\n\nMaterialise (MTLS): 2019, 2018, ... \\[\u20ac196,679  \u20ac184,721  \u20ac142,573,  \u20ac114,477  \u20ac102,035,  \u20ac81,355\\]\n\nYear-over-year Growth: 2019, 2018, ... \\[6.4%, 29.56%, 24.54%, 12.19%, 25.41%\\]\n\nNow I'm not going to go through and do all your homework. This is an example of how to approach a topic. It requires more work, more companies, reading 10-k's and probably knowing more than I do about the 3d-printer industry, if you want additional certainty. This is the process. Nothing I used was a paywalled service. There are no greeks or probabilistic distributions and long-tails to understand. I used very basic math and a bit of reasoning, and a really good mental model by a few guys written 20 years ago. The case studies they were writing about were Microsoft, Cisco, and Novell Netware. The mental model hasn't changed.\n\nThese are not gorilla game numbers, according to their model. Revenues should be spiking upwards harder than this. It should be more obvious. All the same it still appears from this initial investigation to be a potentially solid growth industry. Let's also note the comparison of those two companies, year over year. 3% vs 6%. 29% vs 29%, 15% vs 24%, 12% vs 12%, 26% vs 25%. If this was my only metric, I'd think two things. First, Materialise is leading, PRLB is reacting. Second, both of these companies are growing revenues significantly so I might have found an industry on it's way up, but one in which there is no winner-take-all. Looking more like a growth industry situation than a monopoly situation, the \"Gorilla Game\". A rising tide lifts all boats situation.\n\nTo get to a level of certainty where this would constitute an investment and not a guess, we would need to mine SEC Edgar for more years and do this with more companies, along with other metrics. Revenue is a good start, but it is not enough to provide safety. Net Earnings, debt/equity, other things of this sort. If you were the type that likes to forecast earnings into the future, this is the sort of thing that would be suitable for a DCF model into the future. So much the better if you had some in-depth knowledge about 3d-printing.\n\nThis is how you get going. It's not magic, just legwork (in my case keyboard work), mental models, some competence in the industry you're fishing and some basic math and reasoning skills.\n\nTools used to create this example:\n\nGoogle, SEC Edgar, this article ([https://investingnews.com/daily/tech-investing/emerging-tech-investing/top-3d-printing-companies/](https://investingnews.com/daily/tech-investing/emerging-tech-investing/top-3d-printing-companies/)), a cheap laptop and about 20 minutes of typing.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer - I am just a retard w/ a keyboard and you should do your own $DD. Also the karma whores @ WSB keep deleting my shit so one of you go post over there if you like $BB and what you read*\n\nTOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8x0sjsj4wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc0b996f191f3f47d37bb6b2888f537c6789ae0e\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW yesterday to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7cepei5wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7308c115e3d45a072dac92b20ac029eb132b348\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s89num7wxe61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5361754f68b831f3ad044aba2fed88c6f93c7849\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Normally I would post this on r/wsb, but that place is such a cult right now I don't want to be downvoted to hell.\n\nFrom what has happened this entire week, not only with GME but every most-shorted-stock and even silver now (lol idk what the story behind that is, but people are buying), this is a marked difference from post-2008/09. There are lots of retail buying in everything, and RH (despite some unsavory actions) has actually democratized equities buying. Not going to talk much about economics in this post, but this feels like 1996 again - low US rates, a hot new sector (this time green energy), EM markets stronger (USD flows into Asia etc) - which all combine to probably a few good years for equities before the tax hike discussions start.\n\n\\---\n\n**There will be less shorting**. Melvin was the poster whipping boy that got hung out to dry by the rest of Wall Street. Most of the pump wasn't because of r/wsb no matter how many \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80 we post. Most of the pump was your option writer (Barclay's, DB, funds with covered call strategies including pension funds that hold onto a buttload of shares) suddenly having to buy 99 shares as delta gaps from 0.01 to 1.00 overnight. There's also gamma hedging and other strategies, but this is just a vanilla description of delta hedging.\n\nNow that shorts can be blown out of the water just like that, there might be a change in how option volatility works. Black Monday in 1987 caused the volatility smirk - puts will be more expensive than calls. This might cause the other way around. I know this might mean more expensive calls especially in lightly traded names which means it's harder to make money buying calls, but in any case, there will be less shorting. That entire short strategy will be embraced by less and less money.\n\n**Where the money will go.** People will find their way back to megacaps and indices. Yeah you may not have 200% overnight gains, but people know these stocks. You can also add the fact that value is coming back (so more SPY and IWM), but barring any kind of black swan event, you're not supposed to go to sleep dreaming about Lambos or if you'll be able to afford that pack of ramen holding these. People do get tired after overtrading, and in the end, all those flows will come back to the \"safer alternatives.\"\n\nAlso, IVs on index ETF calls are wonderfully cheap. That should also drive some of the flows.\n\n**The youth are back buying stocks**. I'm also talking about myself, a young person in my late 20s. This is a difference from post-2008 where we never got that kind of euphoria. Now, every one of my buddies are glued to their trading accounts and reddit (thought that was probably there before), or if not that, their retirement accounts.\n\nMakes sense because the 2008 crisis was centered around the financial industry. People are affected by the serial-position effect and recency effect (once bitten, twice shy). In 2008, it was stocks and in 2021 it's most likely going to be shorting. Everyone will come back and chase the new hot issue, because the amount of FOMO and YOLO in the markets are comparable to just before the tech bubble. Did 2000 stop people from investing? Well from my dad who lost almost everything in YHOO, he bought into MSFT (because no way that company could die) and is going quite well for himself.
