        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 29, 2021**\n\nStocks hit fresh record highs as market participants considered a batch of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings reports and new proposals from President Biden aimed at revamping the US\u2019 infrastructure and supporting families, children, and students. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) hit a new intraday record, driven by gains in mega-cap stocks like Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL), both of which reported blowout earnings. \n\nLast night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said \u201cAmerica was back on the move again\u201d following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).\n\nEarnings season continues to deliver blowout results, with Apple and Facebook massively outperforming analyst expectations. Facebook\u2019s stock, in particular, gapped up more than 7%. The strong results from these companies adds to a parade of mega-cap companies that have vastly outperformed estimates, driven by a surge in demand as the US economy gradually reopens thanks to effective vaccine distribution. According to FactSet, as of early Wednesday, companies comprising nearly half of the S&amp;P 500's market capitalization had reported earnings results, with 83% of these corporations topping estimates, and by an average of 21.7%. \n\nMarket participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, \u201cAmid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.\u201d The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as \u201chaving shown improvement\u201d, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.\n   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week\n   * **Continuing claims, week ended April 17:** 3.660 million vs. 3.590 million expected and a downwardly revised 3.651 million during the prior week\n* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees.

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.\n\n# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.\n*****\n&gt; Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden is expected to detail his \u201cAmerican Families Plan\u201d and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.\n*****\n&gt; As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; # The central bank takes the main stage\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge is reported.\n*****\n&gt; The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they\u2019re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they\u2019ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for the Fed,\u201d said Swonk.\n*****\n&gt; The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls \u2018last call,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cReally what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.\n*****\n&gt; # Tax hike prospects\n&gt; Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.\n*****\n&gt; Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,\u201d said Lyngen.\n*****\n&gt; So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.\n*****\n&gt; David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is tech week. I think we\u2019re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,\u201d Bianco said.\n*****\n&gt; He said he\u2019s not in favor of Wall Street\u2019s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re overweight equities really because we\u2019re concerned about rising interest rates,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI\u2019m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,\u201d he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. \u201cEnergy is doomed. It\u2019s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.\n*****\n&gt; Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they\u2019ve been delivering,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/03KqldG.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FctG7IL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iq1PKMJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eegfti6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/cdNcBaJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhkNZLm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9js7oZJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g84GywG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/64LgRnj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dD0vkLd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LaQNKey.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rOIVB71.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hKlmSsP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Fntbm0R.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.\n\n&gt; Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.\n\n&gt; Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d832ea3cc4bbc31e8cfe94f03d98ac6/8e21ed4124083bdb-70/s500x750/83b3d05531a38363e7eae827dfdc65cea7df6790.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8d8b97ef2c731be8f580e16dbe25d431/8e21ed4124083bdb-5f/s500x750/1e8a68dfbdeea8147d89c8ac91122b1b05419ecb.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cd741bab290266df3e64e5ed52a0d7a7/8e21ed4124083bdb-b0/s500x750/6384a25868caf6c5fcfad8e452b0ae508758114a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy\n\n&gt; The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n&gt; After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.\n\n&gt; The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMomentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.\u201d\n\n&gt; The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65\u2014the most at-risk age segment of the population\u2014has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?\n\n&gt; \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d Old investment saying\n\n&gt; One of the popular questions we\u2019ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let\u2019s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn\u2019t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.\n\n&gt; After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn\u2019t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut let\u2019s not sound any alarms yet, we don\u2019t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it\u2019s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar\n\n&gt; It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world\u2019s reserve currency acted as a \u201csafe haven\u201d asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.\n\n&gt; We view the \u201ctwin deficits\u201d of the U.S. economy\u2014the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit\u2014as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it\u2019s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. \u201cThe short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.\u201d\n\n&gt; U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.\n\n&gt; A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up.

Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.\n\n&gt; In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&amp;P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&amp;P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&amp;P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.\n\n&gt; Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042221-5-Pullbacks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?\n\n&gt; If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&amp;P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&amp;P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&amp;P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&amp;P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&amp;P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&amp;P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!\n\n&gt; It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-Above-200-DMA.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 23rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVSgvKq0pQw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.25.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNEOWj2EubI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.\n\n# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.\n*****\n&gt; Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden is expected to detail his \u201cAmerican Families Plan\u201d and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.\n*****\n&gt; As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; # The central bank takes the main stage\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge is reported.\n*****\n&gt; The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they\u2019re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they\u2019ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for the Fed,\u201d said Swonk.\n*****\n&gt; The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls \u2018last call,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cReally what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.\n*****\n&gt; # Tax hike prospects\n&gt; Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.\n*****\n&gt; Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,\u201d said Lyngen.\n*****\n&gt; So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.\n*****\n&gt; David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is tech week. I think we\u2019re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,\u201d Bianco said.\n*****\n&gt; He said he\u2019s not in favor of Wall Street\u2019s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re overweight equities really because we\u2019re concerned about rising interest rates,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI\u2019m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,\u201d he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. \u201cEnergy is doomed. It\u2019s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.\n*****\n&gt; Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they\u2019ve been delivering,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/03KqldG.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FctG7IL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iq1PKMJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eegfti6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/cdNcBaJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhkNZLm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9js7oZJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g84GywG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/64LgRnj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dD0vkLd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LaQNKey.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rOIVB71.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hKlmSsP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Fntbm0R.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.\n\n&gt; Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.\n\n&gt; Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d832ea3cc4bbc31e8cfe94f03d98ac6/8e21ed4124083bdb-70/s500x750/83b3d05531a38363e7eae827dfdc65cea7df6790.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8d8b97ef2c731be8f580e16dbe25d431/8e21ed4124083bdb-5f/s500x750/1e8a68dfbdeea8147d89c8ac91122b1b05419ecb.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cd741bab290266df3e64e5ed52a0d7a7/8e21ed4124083bdb-b0/s500x750/6384a25868caf6c5fcfad8e452b0ae508758114a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy\n\n&gt; The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n&gt; After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.\n\n&gt; The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMomentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.\u201d\n\n&gt; The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65\u2014the most at-risk age segment of the population\u2014has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?\n\n&gt; \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d Old investment saying\n\n&gt; One of the popular questions we\u2019ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let\u2019s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn\u2019t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.\n\n&gt; After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn\u2019t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut let\u2019s not sound any alarms yet, we don\u2019t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it\u2019s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar\n\n&gt; It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world\u2019s reserve currency acted as a \u201csafe haven\u201d asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.\n\n&gt; We view the \u201ctwin deficits\u201d of the U.S. economy\u2014the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit\u2014as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it\u2019s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. \u201cThe short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.\u201d\n\n&gt; U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.\n\n&gt; A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up. For more on our tactical market views, check out our April Global Portfolio Strategy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Dips in Short Supply\n\n&gt; While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.\n\n&gt; In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&amp;P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&amp;P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&amp;P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.\n\n&gt; Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042221-5-Pullbacks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?\n\n&gt; If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&amp;P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&amp;P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&amp;P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&amp;P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&amp;P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&amp;P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!\n\n&gt; It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-Above-200-DMA.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 23rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVSgvKq0pQw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.25.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNEOWj2EubI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

Paysafe just went public through a reverse merger SPAC, and has been trading on the NYSE for less than a week. This is like getting in bed with Square at $15/share.\n\nHere are 8 reasons to believe\ud83d\ude4c:\n\n1. Bill Foley is behind the merger. The man is a legend in Financial Services and has a strong history of value creation, having led five separate multibillion-dollar public market platforms that completed over 100 acquisitions. Think Fidelity National Financial, Fidelity Information Services, Black Knight Financial, Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet, Ceridian. You know, small companies. \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. Founded in 1996, Paysafe is a leading global payments provider focused on digital commerce and iGaming transactions. The global online gambling market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027. \ud83d\udcc8\n\n3. Paysafe holds the No. 2 market share position in the global digital wallet market. The company\u2019s digital wallet is in over 120 markets and has customers like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) and William Hill. The company has 3.8 million active users for its digital wallet segment.\n\n4. Paysafe is No. 1 in the iGaming eCash network segment. Customers for this segment include Fortnite, Twitch and Spotify Technologies (NYSE: SPOT).\n\n5. The company estimates that its 2021 payment volume will hit $103 billion. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0Billion with a B! Revenue of $1.5 billion is estimated for fiscal 2021. Paysafe said revenue will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% from 2020 to 2023.\n\n6. The digital wallet segment is expected to have $441 million in revenue for 2021 with a 1.9% take on transactions. This represents 29% of the company\u2019s 2021 revenue.\n\n7. The eCash segment has 12 million active users and $5 billion in payment volume. This segment has a take of 6.8% and is expected to have 2021 revenue of $318 million.\n\n8. The integrated processing segment has over $75 billion in payment volume and a 1% take.

        "selftext": "Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects healthy double digit revenue growth, strong and growing EBITDA margins to support its M&amp;A plans but the stock's recent pounding has brought the bears out in force, with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the length here, but I thought I'd address them all in one post:\n\nFirst, here\u2019s Paysafe's Q1 minimum guidance to meet or beat on May 11 ER:\n\n\t$360 million revenue\n\n\t$220 million gross profit\n\n\t$105 million EBITDA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommon arguments addressed here:\n\n\\#1 Too much debt, they are going to borrow more.\n\n\\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no MOAT\n\n\\#3 Blackstone made 3X and will sell\n\n\\#4 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult\n\n\\#5 No growth\n\n\\#6 Slow growth\n\n\\#7 Not profitable\n\n\\#8 Old business\n\n\\#9 It\u2019s a SPAC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1) Too much debt.  Paysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again?  Their path to EBITDA margin growth (21% CAGR) is what will pay for M&amp;A expansion. Their 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers.  Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to service debt.  Most fintech competitors have negative EBITDA putting them at higher risk (Higher ratio is worse.) :\n\nSquare: 77.8X\n\nRepay : 8.7X\n\nFiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5 X\n\nGPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X\n\nShift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA\n\nAffirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA\n\nPaysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA \n\nBill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA\n\nDepending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of these competitors, whether by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue, puts Paysafe\u2019s share price in the $45 to $90 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no MOAT.  Bill Foley has repeatedly said that Paysafe's \u201cunrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise,\u201d is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s MOAT. This is the reason they are able to dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are expanding to serve the underbanked and unbanked, spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to enter due to risk and complexity.  As they lean into their regulatory lead, PayPal's former CRO has joined Paysafe and a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert has recently joined their Board of Directors.\n\nFrom SEC filed transcript (1) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh:  \u201cTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a winner in this space, you\u2019re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That\u2019s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we\u2019ve entered.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3) Blackstone made 3X and will sell.  The common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion and receiving $9 billion.  The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (2), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it\u2019s basically a 33% return on a 4 year hold. \n\nImportantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley\u2019s time-tested M&amp;A playbook. \n\nBlackstone itself says (3), \u201cThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.\u201d With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?\n\nBlackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d \n\nIn a recent interview Foley said, private equity\u2019s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d\n\nThis trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: \u201cCommitment of Paysafe\u2019s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders\u2019 belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4) Growth by acquisition is hard. Bill  Foley's proven track record in quickly generating synergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A, speaks for itself. Over the last five years  Foley has grow Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X  ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS  from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). The majority of that growth was inorganic value creation through M&amp;A. Foley says, \u201cThose  characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with  Paysafe.\u201d (1, 4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5) No growth. It\u2019s true that Paysafe\u2019s revenue stagnated in 2020 due to Covid, but prior to that growth they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5): \n\n2017: $864 million rev\n\n2018 : $1.14 billion rev  (+32%)\n\n2019 : $1.418 billion rev  (+24%).\n\n2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)\n\nUnlike most fintechs, Paysafe is very diversified with heavy exposure to brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed by 2020 closures due to Covid.  During this market dislocation, they pivoted, \u201cexited low value referral channels\u201d and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and ecommmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.  \n\nLooking at other hard-hit brick-and-mortar payment processors like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:\n\n\u2014Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)\n\n\u2014 Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)\n\nThe averaged EV/EBITDA multiples of these two payment processors would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $25\n\nTheir averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6) Slow growth. Going forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10%+ annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years.  iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe\u2019s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion. \n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso, who  recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d \n\nSince he wrote that, here are some of the headlines indicating an upgrade to his price target:\n\n\t1.\t\"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n\n\t2.\t\"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n\n\t3.\tNew Hampshire: \"Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n\n\t4.\t\"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n\n\t5.\t\"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n\n\t6.\t\"Wyoming Legalizes Crypto Use for Online Sports Betting\"\n\n\t7.\t\u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n\n\t8.\t\"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n\n\t9.\t\u201cCaesars Entertainment \\[Paysafe partner\\] announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n\n\t10.\t\u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n\n\t11.\t\u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n\n\t12.\t\u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n\n\t13.\t\u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n\n\t14.\t\u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and do not have positive free cash flow.\n\n2. Using low end of Paysafe's projections and factors in debt and potential dilution.\n\n3. As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth.\n\n4. The above comps were taken during a market pull back and do not reflect fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s comments about them posing \"enormous competitive threats\" to banks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7) Not profitable. Paysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with a healthy $500-560 million EBITDA (30% margin). These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe: \n\nRepay: -0.67, \n\nAffirm : -2.18, \n\nNuvei : -1.08, \n\nPaysign : -0.19. \n\nBill : -0.62, \n\nShift4 : -0.43 \n\nAverage EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8) Old business. In this space, having many years of multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise is a plus. This is why Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is expected to grow 10X. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market  volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected  to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d \n\nOn its face, it may not be sexy to the average person but Paysafe is consdered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d and they are rapidly  expanding in US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase,  Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)\n\nTrustpilot (7) in Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d  (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews.\n\nPaysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They\u2019ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, recently voted  \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d,  \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current  ecosystems\u201d and they\u2019ve enabled crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin &amp; 26 other crypto-currencies).\n\nAside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash,  integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service to the 1.7 billion \u201dunbanked.\u201d  This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#9) It\u2019s a SPAC. Maybe the best argument.  \n\nPaysafe has been tarred and feathered as a SPAC: guilty until proven innocent.  Even after ticker change, Cramer called it a SPAC in the same breath that he said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d(8) \n\nIt\u2019s a hard moniker to drop. Literally every bear article written on Paysafe has relied on saying it was suspect because it was a SPAC, saying things like because Chamath sold Virgin Galactic, Paysafe can't be trusted. By contrast the bull articles that bothered to explore the fundamentals generally came up with $24-25 price targets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I hold $600K in commons and warrants\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

(OTCQB \u2013 RKFL)**\u00a0is poised to transform the global eCommerce industry, in our view. The Company is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and dozens of other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RocketFuel is the\u00a0first cryptocurrency payment service\u00a0to provide a seamless and elegant one-click checkout experience that today's digital and mobile-centric consumers have come to expect from eCommerce marketplaces, such as\u00a0**Amazon (NASDAQ \u2013 AMZN)**.\u00a0\n\nThe RocketFuel platform, based on patent-pending technology, enables merchants and consumers to easily complete payment for goods and services using 43 different cryptocurrencies or direct bank transfer in a completely secure environment. A significant benefit of the Company\u2019s approach is that the entire shopping cart checkout process can be executed via a distributed ledger or blockchain. Thus, merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex, and costly payment and check-out infrastructures. With the one-click checkout used on RocketFuel-partnered sites, consumers will enjoy unrivalled convenience .\n\nAs is typically the case with new technologies and applications with a broad scope, we expect early adopters to dominate usage during 2021 as online merchants shopping cart and payment solutions providers implement the crypto acceptance functionality, with mass market utilization occurring in 2022. With estimates suggesting that the number of (non-Facebook) crypto wallet holders will grow to 250M+ in the next 2-3 years, up from 68M today, substantial adoption lies ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n***The Problem***\n\neCommerce has enjoyed wide, mainstream adoption and in many cases has emerged as the shopping method of choice for consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, for merchants and consumers alike, many of the payment system setups and associated technologies in place today have underlying issues, which in turn have a deleterious effect on merchant/consumer transaction execution.\n\nFor consumers, payment systems and shopping cart utilization can be awkward and clunky, require multiple steps and redirects to 3rd parties, and may not be secure, resulting in a less than stellar customer experience. For merchants, the current eCommerce payment infrastructure is even more problematic. In most cases, merchants are required to use an intermediary, costing billions in excess expenses annually. Roughly 1 in 5 carts leave without completing a transaction because consumers do not trust the merchant\u2019s system. Plus, in most cases, fees are high, payments are delayed, and exorbitant fees due to fraud, fraud prevention, and chargebacks related to the inefficient back-end operations can be excessive, reducing profits.\n\n***The Solution*** \n\nIn contrast, by leveraging modern blockchain technology and its proprietary platform, RocketFuel offers consumers a single-click pay solution, pay with crypto or direct bank transfer option with no redirects or filling out forms as the information is stored at once. The process is seamless-simple, efficient, secure, and convenient. Merchants generate higher shopping cart conversion, pay lower fees, have greater security, transparency, less fraud, and improved cash flow. With a better experience for both sides of the transaction, and improved order and shipping fulfillment, merchants can foster loyalty and generate recurring business.\u00a0\n\n***Today and Tomorrow***\n\nThe Company launched its first product in a live environment in March 2021 and with two travel merchant customers and a tax auditing firm in hand, management intends to continue to develop the check-out technology with several larger U.S. eCommerce merchants, social media and blogsites. With connections to several larger eCommerce merchants, near term sales and marketing efforts will focus on a few \u201cbig fish\u201d rather than many smaller merchants and will scale up initiatives as funding permits. We believe that the Company will also target specific verticals that may be a source of early adopters and crypto wallet holders in verticals such as online gambling, gaming, and with merchants selling high ticket items. In conjunction with this targeted approach, RocketFuel may utilize social media to generate awareness and attract consumer influencers. Given that the phase from early adoption to mass market adoption can take 12-18 months, we believe that the Company could enjoy exponential merchant sign-ups going forward, along with consumer utilization, from 2021-2022, with the greatest recurring platform utilization by consumers beginning in 2023.\u00a0\n\n***Financial Forecasts and Valuation***\n\nIt is difficult to accurately project the deployment and adoption success of a new technology and application such as the unique RocketFuel blockchain and crypto payment service.\u00a0 However, given the underlying growth rates in blockchain ledger utilization for financial and payment transactions, as well as the proliferation of crypto wallet adoption, it is clear that major upside exists. Widespread adoption and growth are further affirmed by the Company\u2019s underlying offering which solves major unmet needs in eCommerce for merchants and consumers alike. As with many young companies, it comes down to efficient execution. The management has a strong, proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies.\n\nWe should note that our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to firmly estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.\n\nTo simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) and revenue of $12M in FY23E with net profit of $650K, or $0.02. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.\n\nGiven the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.\n\nFinally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel\u2019s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management\u2019s capabilities.\n\n**INDUSTRY PRIMER: BLOCKCHAIN**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAccording to a recent report by Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.\n\nA blockchain, also known as a \u201cdistributed ledger technology,\u201d is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records used to secure transactions across multiple devices that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible.\n\nTransactions in money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be implemented and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and sophisticated code---without intermediaries. Given the opportunities associated with such a disruptive technology, many firms in varied industries are actively operating in the space to transact business, agreements and financial transactions more efficiently.\n\nCommercial and central banks across the world are now using blockchain technology for payment processing and issuing of their digital currencies. The technology enables cross-border payments that are less expensive and faster as compared to traditional systems. The remittance cost within the blockchain is 2% to 3% of the total amount as compared to other third parties as blockchain does not require third-party authentication.\u00a0Even governments are introducing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) to replace cash and traditional fiat-currencies. Plus, they are putting social media behemoths such as Facebook and Google under scrutiny for their lack of privacy protection and data security.\n\nOne of the most popular applications of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Trading in cryptocurrency is relatively easy compared to other assets. You can begin trading just\u00a0by signing up for various wallets on the market. Furthermore, there are different types of wallet apps, each with its own advantages, such as\u00a0levels of security, accessibility, and more. The most popular and well-known wallet is Coinbase with 639,885 daily active users (DAUs). If Facebook\u2019s Libra initiative to its 2B users is successful, this figure will be dwarfed in short order.\n\nThe payments segment dominated the market in 2020 and accounted for more than 44.0% share of the global revenue. Blockchain technology improves payment system efficiency, minimizes operating costs, and offers transparency. These benefits provided by blockchain technology are increasing its use in payment solutions, thus, driving the segment growth. At the same time, blockchain reduces the need for middlemen in payment processing, which is also a major factor driving the segment growth.\n\nBitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency) is the most popular application of blockchain, but increasingly this innovative technology\u00a0can be used in various business and commercial purposes. The elimination of the middleman in various transactions and processes promises a much more efficient workflow using blockchain.\u00a0Additionally, increasing concerns about privacy and security make blockchain an ideal technological pipeline for modern processes.\n\nEnter the eCommerce application.\n\n**ROCKETFUEL: THE GAME-CHANGER**\n\nWhen validating a new market or technology, it is instructive to review history as it tends to repeat itself. Most major technology breakthroughs and disruptions had a few things in common:\n\n* A large, inefficient market, usually based on old technologies and processes, generating problems and unnecessary cost for all stakeholders.\n* A new technology allowing new companies to invent new solutions that address these problems.\n\nSome examples include improved internet technology which enabled Amazon to evolve our commerce habits from brick and mortar to digital and mobile technology innovations and evolutions that have led to Uber and Lyft transforming transportation.\u00a0 The payments industry is no different. Its architecture and operations are still based on a 40-year-old physical card with a chip and limited fraud prevention capabilities. In contrast, digital technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are prompting the replacement of the old architecture with a new efficient, lower cost approach. y changes the way payments are made.\n\nThere is a huge inefficient market (the payment market) causing problems for all stakeholders. There is a technology that has the potential to fix it. Enter RocketFuel Blockchain.\n\nRocketFuel is a new frictionless blockchain based payment solution for eCommerce merchants to accept payments in crypto or cash via bank transfer and receive payment and shipping information in one one-click transaction without the need for payment intermediaries. In anticipation of a major proliferation in crypto utilization for payments and business, large eCommerce and retail merchants now accept crypto as a payment method. In fact, over one-third of all small and medium-sized U.S. companies already accept Bitcoin as a B2B payment source.\n\nThe eCommerce space is estimated to be $3.5T, yet it represents less than 15% of total commerce. PayPal, a significant player in the online payments arena with over 350M users, allowed users to buy and sell crypto and just announced its \u201cCheckout for Crypto\u201d feature. This function, allows users to instantly convert their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash to US dollars (with no additional transaction fees) that PayPal then uses to complete the transaction. In our view, this is a validation of the RocketFuel approach and will likely capture its share of this function. Still, since it lacks the 1-click convenience and appears to still be clunky and expensive relative to our forecast of the RocketFuel pricing, RocketFuel remains in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nAs mentioned above, existing solutions are costly, impact conversion, not secure, leads to fraud, and will eventually go the way of the milkman. Merchants and consumers alike crave security, convenience, transparency, low cost and trust. \u00a0\n\n***The*** ***RocketFuel*** ***Approach***\n\nThe Company provides check-out and payment systems directly on the check-out page that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. The check-out systems are designed to enhance customers\u2019 data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, the check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant.\n\nThey also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page.\n\nData is key and the merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the funds received by the merchant from the different currencies.\n\nCustomers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are able to connect to multiple exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini and others to pay directly from them. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to connect with multiple bank accounts to pay from as well.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7The \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The payment user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms.\n\nCryptocurrencies are stored in different types of cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets can include mobile wallets, web wallets, desktop wallets, hardware wallets, and exchange wallets. Currently, it can be a difficult, confusing and multi-step process to use these wallets to make cryptocurrency payments. With RocketFuel\u2019s blockchain solution, cryptocurrency holders can use any of the above digital wallets to make payment for products or services to any RocketFuel merchant with 1, 2, or 3 steps.\n\nUsing the \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out technology and check-out button, consumers will no longer be re-directed to a third-party\u00a0 With the RocketFuel solution, eCommerce merchants will need no contact or other information exchange with the consumer in order to receive their payment or shipping details. Instead, they will have immediate visibility of payments from customers via the RocketFuel payment system, which may be integrated into merchants\u2019 fulfillment centers.\n\nLooking ahead, the technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, under a future version of the payment system, advertisements in which the entire check-out process is embedded will be able to be placed on third party websites and sales may be completely finalized there. Thus, the platform will enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. This prospective feature is unlike any other currently in use today and could eventually be a significant driver of revenue, once completed. Such advertisements will provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions.\n\nIn addition to potential competition from PayPal, the primary competitor remains Bitpay, which is already well established as the leading crypto payment technology in the market, having been founded in 2011. Given that RocketFuel offers a better user experience for crypto payments, allows payment from dozens of other cryptocurrencies, and other wallets, and exchanges, RocketFuel\u2019s diversity is a major strength.\u00a0 RocketFuel also offers services that Bitpay currently does not, such as providing merchants immediate visibility of payment transactions, real time metrics of transactions and customers, easy integration to ecommerce checkout as well as deep integration to backend platforms. Furthermore, with an average of 72,000 transactions per month, it will not take significant merchant penetration for RocketFuel to surpass Bitpay, in our view.\n\n***Target Markets*** \n\nThe Company\u2019s initial target market is the travel industry and RockeFuel already has signed up two sizable customers: Sky Tours and Military Fares. It should be noted that worldwide sales of flight tickets sold online in 2019 was $540B and the 2 largest reservations systems generate more than $10B in yearly revenue, making this vertical a hot commodity. Management plans to target travel merchant and web platforms. Given the complexity of the intermediaries and reservation systems, high costs and notoriously delayed payments, the RocketFuel solution can simplify the payment process and customers no longer have to provide sensitive information. We believe other verticals such as online gambling, the procurement of gift cards, and high-ticket items could prove to be lucrative for the Company. As a result, we expect sales and marketing headcount to rise over the next 12-18 months, in conjunction with rapid deployment and implementation of existing and future solutions.\n\n**ROCKETFUEL BLOCKCHAIN LEADERSHIP TEAM**\n\n**Gert Funk, Chairman, Founder, Chief Product Officer**\n\nGert Funk has over 15 years as a payment service provider for international eCommerce merchants. A serial entrepreneur since 1990, he is the founder of RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc. Gert has been an expert in blockchain technology and applications for eCommerce since 2015.\n\n**Peter Jensen, Chief Executive Officer**\n\nPeter Jensen is an experienced executive with extensive global experience within enterprise software. After holding sales and marketing positions within Oracle, Symantec, and VMware in Europe and the US, Peter has been focusing on building and growing start-ups in Silicon Valley as CEO and VP of Sales. Examples include Thinstall (acquired\u00a0 by VMware), StopTheHacker (acquired by Cloudflare), ParStream (acquired by CISCO), SPanugo (acquired by IBM), and others. He is currently the CEO of RocketFuel Blockchain, a fintech software company providing a payment solution that allows eCommerce merchants to receive Crypto payments.\n\n**Bennett** **Yankowitz, Chief Financial Officer**\n\nBennett Yankowitz is an expert in ICO law with more than 30 years of experience as a corporate attorney with leading law firms. Ben specializes in securities, financial and merger and acquisition transactions. He holds law degrees from the University of Southern California and the University of Cambridge.\n\n**Rohan Hall, Chief Technology Officer**\n\nRohan Hall has over 30 years of experience in the technology sector, Rohan is a noted and published author and Fintech company founder. A serial entrepreneur and Blockchain expert, Rohan has had successful blockchain exits.\n\n**FINANCIAL FORECASTS**\n\n*(Analyst\u2019s Note: These forecasts are our own and we did not receive guidance or projections from RKFL management.)*\n\nOur forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be in the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.\n\nTo simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for FY22E or Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) as management begins meaningful sales and marketing expenses to build awareness and execute merchant signups in key verticals such as the travel industry and online gambling.\u00a0\n\nIn FY23E, we forecast significant revenue growth with top line reaching the $12M mark. Total operating expenses are estimated to reach $8.25M with expanded sales and marketing expenses, along with R&amp;D, reflecting upgrades to the core functionality. Based on this model, net profit is slated to reach $650K, or $0.02, with a slight rise in shares outstanding to reflect a modest fundraise in conjunction with a prospective up-list to NASDAQ. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.\n\nIt should be noted that while there are not material direct COGS, we have allocated some indirect expenses to arrive at a gross margin of around 72-73% for all years. We believe that this is conservative and may have to be adjusted higher, thereby raising profitability and our price target.\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\nIn our view, the Company\u2019s biggest risks are straightforward: the timing and magnitude of broad adoption of its core technology and applications by both merchants and consumers. Secondary risks include changes in the regulatory environment affecting utilization along with marketing effectiveness. Competitive risks include lower pricing, more effective sales/marketing, greater functionality and features. The aforementioned risks could come from larger competitors, existing firms, or new entrants. Still, these future concerns are consistent with firms of RocketFuel\u2019s size and early mover standing. Moreover, we believe that the Company\u2019s seasoned management team is prepared to overcome these hurdles and generate significant top-line growth, deployment and\u00a0 implementations.\n\nVolatility and liquidity are typical concerns for microcap stocks that trade on the over the counter (OTC) stock market. In addition to a recent funding access announcement regarding Triton Funds, management may seek to raise additional capital next year in conjunction with an up-list to NASDAQ, to fund corporate expansion and potential M&amp;A. An overriding financial benefit as a public company is the favorable access to and the availability of capital to fund product launches, consistent marketing campaigns and other initiatives. Since the proceeds of any future funding would be used in large part to advance major business development and sales, we believe that any dilutive effect from such a funding could be offset by related increases in market value.\n\n**VALUATION AND CONCLUSION**\n\nRKFL is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and 40+ other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RKFL is the\u00a0first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless one-click checkout experience. The market is huge and growing at an enviable rate. According to Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.\n\nCurrent eCommerce methods are outdated, problematic, and costly, while the Company\u2019s platform is designed to improve the merchant and customer experience. Implementation should lead to lower merchant costs, potential recurring business and may foster customer loyalty.\u00a0\n\nManagement has a proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors.\u00a0The CEO has exited 5 other companies. Thus, we envision RKFL emerging as a takeover candidate. At present, our forecasts suggest sales will jump from $1.8M to $40M in 3 years, with meaningful EPS. Stocks tend to generate their greatest gains when the transition from early adoption to mass market appeal begins, which could begin in late 2021.\n\nGiven the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.\n\nFinally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel\u2019s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management\u2019s capabilities.",

Paysafe just went public through a reverse merger SPAC, and has been trading on the NYSE for less than a week. This is like getting in bed with Square at $15/share.\n\nHere are 8 reasons to believe\ud83d\ude4c:\n\n1. Bill Foley is behind the merger. The man is a legend in Financial Services and has a strong history of value creation, having led five separate multibillion-dollar public market platforms that completed over 100 acquisitions. Think Fidelity National Financial, Fidelity Information Services, Black Knight Financial, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Ceridian. You know, small companies. \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. Founded in 1996, Paysafe is a leading global payments provider focused on digital commerce and iGaming transactions. The global online gambling market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027. \ud83d\udcc8\n\n3. Paysafe holds the No. 2 market share position in the global digital wallet market. The company\u2019s digital wallet is in over 120 markets and has customers like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) and William Hill. The company has 3.8 million active users for its digital wallet segment.\n\n4. Paysafe is No. 1 in the iGaming eCash network segment. Customers for this segment include Fortnite, Twitch and Spotify Technologies (NYSE: SPOT).\n\n5. The company estimates that its 2021 payment volume will hit $103 billion. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0Billion with a B! Revenue of $1.5 billion is estimated for fiscal 2021. Paysafe said revenue will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% from 2020 to 2023.\n\n6. The digital wallet segment is expected to have $441 million in revenue for 2021 with a 1.9% take on transactions. This represents 29% of the company\u2019s 2021 revenue.\n\n7. The eCash segment has 12 million active users and $5 billion in payment volume. This segment has a take of 6.8% and is expected to have 2021 revenue of $318 million.\n\n8. The integrated processing segment has over $75 billion in payment volume and a 1% take. This segment is expected to have revenue of $764 million in fiscal 2021, representing 50% of the company\u2019s total.\n\nMind you THIS IS NOT A STARTUP! It\u2019s a profitable company with a proven track record, robust sales and a lucrative Total Addressable Market within reach. It\u2019s a long term hold for sure, but with the core drivers outlined above I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see this as a 10x bagger in less than 5 years. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udcc8\n\nPositions: 600 shares @ $16.45  \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market\n\n[Investor Deck](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-presentation.pdf)\n\nhttps://m.benzinga.com/article/18678982",

        "selftext": "Mastercard Inc said on Monday it had agreed to buy digital identity verification company Ekata in a deal valued at $850 million, as the global payments processor bets on a boom in demand for companies in the digital security space.\n\nEkata's products allow businesses to separate fraudsters from legitimate customers during digital interactions like opening an online account or making digital payments. It operates in three industries: e-commerce, payments and financial services, according to its website.\n\n\"The acceleration of online transactions has thrust global digital identity verification to the forefront as one of the biggest opportunities to build digital trust and combat global fraud,\" said Rob Eleveld, chief executive officer of Ekata, in a statement.\n\nSeattle-headquartered Ekata counts more than 2,000 companies as its partners, including credit reporting company Equifax Inc and software firm Intuit Inc, its website showed.\n\nIts products, which include Ekata Identity Graph and Ekata Identity Network, allow companies to combat online fraud, it said.\n\nIn February, Ekata said its revenue had surged in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of e-commerce, boosting demand for services to safeguard against cyber fraud.\n\nEkata added 300 new customers last year, including food and grocery-delivery startup Postmates, which was acquired by Uber Technologies last year. (https://bwnews.pr/32qaUG7)\n\nThe payments processor said the deal is expected to close in the next six months, adding that it does not expect the deal to be a drag on its business for more than two years.\n\n[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-buy-digital-id-verification-134157685.html)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer.

In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 2nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.4.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1mS00Cw_E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$PLUS** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MAXN** \n&gt; * **$EVAX** \n&gt; * **$MITO** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$JFIN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 2nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.4.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1mS00Cw_E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$PLUS** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MAXN** \n&gt; * **$EVAX** \n&gt; * **$MITO** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$JFIN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.
