I have personally cross-verified these estimates and agree within a margin of error.\n\n**Part 1:**\n\nSOS filed a [Form 6-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001346610/000121390020018158/ea0124355-6k_soslimited.htm) on July 21, 2020. In that, they attached their [\"SOS Project Investment Cooperation Agreement\"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001346610/000121390020018158/ea0124355ex99-1_soslimited.htm) with Qingdao West Coast New District Management Committee. See here:\n\nAccording to Article 6 - Rights and Obligations of Party B (SOS Limited), Paragraph 1.2:\n\n\u201cIt is promised that the operating life of SOS headquarters project in Qingdao West Coast New District will be no less than 10 years under normal circumstances. After the project is officially put into operation, the operating income in the first full tax year will be no less than 1.5 billion yuan ($229M) the total annual tax payment will be no less than 100 million yuan ($15.3M), the operating income in the second year will be 3.5 billion yuan ($534M), the tax revenue will be no less than 200 million yuan ($30.5M), the operating income in the third year will reach 5 billion yuan ($763M), the tax revenue will be no less than 300 million yuan (45.8M), and the accumulated operating income in five years will be no less than 30 billion yuan ($4.58B) and the total tax payment is not less than 1.5 billion yuan ($229M).\u201d\n\nTo summarize, SOS must have an operating income of:\n\n* $229M minimum, in its 1st full year (2022)\n* $534M minimum, in its 2nd full year (2023)\n* $763M minimum, in its 3rd full year (2024)\n* $4,580M minimum, in it\u2019s first 5 years combined (2022-2026)\n\nThat would be an average (MINIMUM) operating income of $916M per year, in SOS\u2019s first 5 years of full operation (which starts in 2022).\n\nNote that operating income is not the same as revenue. Revenue is the total amount of income generated by a company for the sale of its goods or services BEFORE any expenses are deducted. Operating income is the sum total of a company's profit AFTER subtracting its regular, recurring costs and expenses.\n\nThus, revenue is innately MUCH GREATER than operating income. Depending on SOS\u2019s profit margins, their net revenue numbers should be assumed to be MUCH GREATER than the operating income numbers shown above.\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but it appears SOS must profit an average of nearly $1 billion per year, in the next 5 years, or they are in breach of this contract. SOS would not willingly sign this contract if they were not supremely confident they could meet these minimum operating income figures.\n\nAnd people ask me why I\u2019m bullish SOS LONG TERM!?!?\n\nThe cooperation agreement also includes free office space rental, industrial land, housing and countless tax write-offs and other monetary rewards. Relocating to Qingdao West Coast New District also opens up many other business opportunities and partnerships. For example, SOS recently partnered with [Qingdao West Coast Healthcare](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sos-ltd-announces-strategic-cooperation-agreement-with-qingdao-west-coast-healthcare-development-group-301193674.html), a state-owned healthcare conglomerate with more than 3,000 cooperative hospitals and more than 100 senior centers.

This means 1 of 2 things: either they already had plans to enter these industries 6 months prior to announcing such, OR they didn\u2019t even figure these new revenue streams into their projected operating income calculations. It is my belief that SOS was planning to exceed the minimum operating incomes outlined above with ONLY their core businesses of emergency rescue, data mining, marketing and insurance.

Today it has proven it has been, is, and will continue to be an SEC compliant company by filing its required annual 20-F form (5/1/2020) [https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-024630/](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-024630/) . Furthermore they intend to continue reporting Quarterly Earnings via form 6-K on a timely basis. This is not a cryptocurrency company. It is a life insurance, digital asset insurance, big data, and blockchain service company that also mines cryptocurrency. As far as I am aware, this post and SOS as a company, abides by the r/wallstreetbets rules.  \n\n\n\\#WangGang",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone! Here is my Monday Newsletter :) Happy trades and please DM me with any questions you may have :)  \n**Week of 5/3/21**\n\nThe S&amp;P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.\n\nManufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit &amp; factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity &amp; labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings. \n\nThe average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](gh2b3blx1xw61 \"\nLumber Futures 6-Month Chart (LBS)\")\n\nVerizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call \u201cYahoo.\u201d Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd. \n\nChip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020\u2019s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. \n\nCisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could \u201c...\\[take\\] another six months\u2026\u201d for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. \n\nThe effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW\u2019s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, \u201c...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter\u2026\u201d So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.  \nGM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying \u201cIf you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors\u2026 these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...\u201d\n\nThe United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   \nMeanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang\u2019s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. \n\nThe increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company\u2019s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it\u2019s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. \n\nMicrosoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector. \n\n**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**\n\n**Monday, May 3rd:**  \nEstee Lauder  \nApollo Global Management Inc  \nCarvana  \nON Semiconductor Corp  \nThe Mosaic Company  \nChegg Inc.\n\n**Tuesday, April 27th:**  \nPfizer  \nT-Mobile  \nCVS  \nActivision Blizzard  \nConocoPhillips  \nSysco  \nZillow  \nXilinx  \nHelloFresh  \nUnder Armor  \nWestern Union  \nMcAfee  \n**Wednesday, April 28th:**  \nPaypal Inc.  \nUber  \nGeneral Motors  \nTwilio Inc  \nMetLife Inc  \nBudweiser Brewing Company  \nBarrick Gold Corp.  \nFranco-Nevada Corp  \nEtsy Inc  \nFox Corp  \nGoDaddy  \nZynga  \n**Thursday, April 29th:**  \nSquare  \nNintendo  \nModerna  \nMonster Beverage Corp  \nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals  \nRoku Inc  \nAIG  \nAllstate  \nWayfair Inc  \nCBS Corp  \nPeloton Interactive  \nCloudflare  \nExpedia  \nKellogg Co.  \nAlliant Energy Corp.   \nPenn National Gaming  \nNorwegian Cruise Line Ltd.  \nDropbox\n\n**Friday, April 30th:**  \nDraft Kings  \nNCsoft",

        "selftext": " Hi Everyone! Here is my Monday Newsletter :) Happy trades and please DM me with any questions you may have :)  \n**Week of 5/3/21**\n\nThe S&amp;P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.\n\nManufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit &amp; factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity &amp; labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings.\n\nThe average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM.\n\nVerizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call \u201cYahoo.\u201d Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd.\n\nChip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020\u2019s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.\n\nCisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could \u201c...\\[take\\] another six months\u2026\u201d for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.\n\nThe effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW\u2019s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, \u201c...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter\u2026\u201d So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.  \nGM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying \u201cIf you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors\u2026 these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...\u201d\n\nThe United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  \nMeanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang\u2019s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.\n\nThe increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company\u2019s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it\u2019s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.\n\nMicrosoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.\n\n**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**\n\n**Monday, May 3rd:**  \nEstee Lauder  \nApollo Global Management Inc  \nCarvana  \nON Semiconductor Corp  \nThe Mosaic Company  \nChegg Inc.\n\n**Tuesday, April 27th:**  \nPfizer  \nT-Mobile  \nCVS  \nActivision Blizzard  \nConocoPhillips  \nSysco  \nZillow  \nXilinx  \nHelloFresh  \nUnder Armor  \nWestern Union  \nMcAfee  \n**Wednesday, April 28th:**  \nPaypal Inc.  \nUber  \nGeneral Motors  \nTwilio Inc  \nMetLife Inc  \nBudweiser Brewing Company  \nBarrick Gold Corp.  \nFranco-Nevada Corp  \nEtsy Inc  \nFox Corp  \nGoDaddy  \nZynga  \n**Thursday, April 29th:**  \nSquare  \nNintendo  \nModerna  \nMonster Beverage Corp  \nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals  \nRoku Inc  \nAIG  \nAllstate  \nWayfair Inc  \nCBS Corp  \nPeloton Interactive  \nCloudflare  \nExpedia  \nKellogg Co.  \nAlliant Energy Corp.  \nPenn National Gaming  \nNorwegian Cruise Line Ltd.  \nDropbox\n\n**Friday, April 30th:**  \nDraft Kings  \nNCsoft",

        "selftext": "The Full Picture: Collapse of HKEX\n\nSince I have seen the whistle blower from SFC who is brave enough to speak out the truth for what the hell is happening in HKEX and SFC, I just can\u2019t hold myself anymore to bring a bigger picture to the public eye\u2019s. People in the industry start calling me Exinsider. I like this name.\n\nAs you may have heard of the name of this stubborn lady, B. Chan, who is the head of listing that has the power to override and disrupt HKEX. She is such an arrogant woman that has always been proud of herself for being a Chinese (while she was well educated in Oxford), oh, and a big fan of TVB as well. She is a huge believer of Chinese Feng Shui astrology that everyone in the office knows and she likes to bite the tips of her reading glasses when she is reading documents/ thinking which is kind of disgusting. \n\nThe story between B. Chan and F.C. has been exposed to the public a few weeks ago.They have only been officially together for a few years. Freeman is known as a player in the law firm he previously worked for. Not only does he cheated with Bonnie when he is with his ex-wife, there are a lot of rumors of him having affairs with the female colleagues in the law firm. \n\nEnough about the background, let\u2019s go back on track. B. Chan and Lin Shi (Ex-managing director in HKEX) were once supervisor-subordinate relationship when they were both in the HKEX. They seem to have a harmonious relationship in outsiders\u2019 eyes but deep down in their heart, they hate each other as much as each other does. It\u2019s an open secret that a lot of insiders have heard that when Bonnie was appointed to take on the seat of David Graham, she mocked at Lin and said \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know her enemy has arrived at her lair, such a stupid woman!\u201d. \n\nAfter she has made her way to the Head of listing, first thing first is to recruit her cronies and combat Lin Shi. The current co-head of IPO, S. Lau is one of the cronies that she had recruited. Lau was only an ordinary senior Vice President before promotion. There is a rumor in the market that Lau has resigned and was planned to go to take on the position of in-house counsel at Ant Group. B. Chan is the one who persuades her to stay in HKEX and gives her promotion. After the promotion, Lau shared the same position with Lin as the co-head of IPO. Shortly after the promotion of Lau, Lin has resigned and left a vacancy of the co-head of IPO. Thus, B. Chan needed to search for another candidate to take on the position. \n\nAround half a year later (Oct 2020), the HKEX has appointed a newcomer J. Wu as the co-head of IPO and the IPO department has finally gone back to the dual-head system. In between the blank period when only Lau is appointed as the sole co-head of IPO, the Ant Group has handed-in their IPO application around Aug 2020. And if you did not forget what I mentioned earlier, Lau has planned to resign and work for the Ant group. Who knows if there is conflict of interest? Is there enough cooling period for both parties? No one knows the truth after all. \n\nGenerally speaking, Lau has a completely different style of work when compared to the previous co-heads of the IPO. The previous co-heads are much more street smart and presentable while Lau and Wu are kinda lacking business sense. Under the leadership of Lau, there are more and more trivial but avoidable problems occurred and are often caused by the lack of business sense. \n\nBesides, rumors in the market have exposed that dated back to early 2020, there were interested parties who proposed the idea of SPAC to B. Chan. Unfortunately, Bonnie is reluctant to do so and feels that SPAC is some kind of shell company that they are aiming to eliminate in the market.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve recently started analyzing data from FINRA and the SEC in an attempt to determine a \u2018worst case\u2019 scenario for short interest. Initially I was focusing on GME and other meme stocks, but have also applied the same technique to the broader S&amp;P500 index list as well with some interesting results.\n\nFINRA Short Volume information scraped from: [http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-June.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-June.html)\n\nSEC Data scraped from: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)\n\nLike any good math problem, we need to prove our work. There are a few fields that we receive from the data feeds that can be used for further calculations. The most notable ones for this case are Short Volume, Short Exempt Volume, Total Volume, and fails per day by ticker. Short Volume and fails are likely familiar with those reading this, but Short Exempt volume may not be.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)\n\nMATHS:\n\nRegular Volume = Total Volume \u2013 Short VolumeTotal Short Volume = Short Volume + Short Exempt VolumeDelta Volume = Total Short Volume \u2013 Regular VolumeCumulative SI = Cumulative SI + Delta Volume\n\nIf Cumulative SI dips to negative, reset to 0\n\nShort Volume Percent = Total Short Volume / Total Volume\n\nASSUMPTION:\n\nThis calculation is conservative and a worst case scenario for the retail investor. The assumption made is that any trade that is in excess of the daily short volume is used to close a prior short sale \u2013 i.e. no retail or investor buying or holding. The goal is to identify situations where abusive or excessive shorting may be happening, and to visually identify shorting and volume trends between tickers.\n\nCAVEATS:\n\nThe data is incomplete, the data is outright wrong, the rules are made up and the points don\u2019t matter. From FINRA\u2019s site directly:\n\n* Short Sale Volume excludes any trading activity that is not publicly disseminated. As a result, some      offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily Volume  and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale volume to total volume.\n* The Short Sale Volume is not consolidated with exchange data. To obtain a complete picture of the short sale volume to total volume for a particular exchange-listed stock, market participants must combine data from each of the TRFs and the ADF, as well as from each exchange.\n* Short Sale Volume does not\u2014and is not intended to\u2014equate to bi-monthly reported short      interest position information. The short interest data reflects aggregate short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month, while the Daily Short Sale Volume reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed and reported as short sales on each trade date.\n\nAs a result, this approach is intended to give an indication of general short interest over time correlated with volume and price, and provide an easy to understand visual representation of short sale trends and worst case covering scenarios.  It is NOT an accurate SI estimate, even if you assume that the reported numbers are accurate and truthful.\n\nPROCESS:\n\nAfter scraping available SEC and FINRA feeds for each relevant ticker, the data is merged and run through a fairly simple python script to calculate the missing fields and plot out using numpy and pandas.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nRH Halts, two GME ETFs, and a few controls:  [https://postimg.cc/gallery/z3NGnx9](https://postimg.cc/gallery/z3NGnx9)\n\nS&amp;P 500:  [https://postimg.cc/gallery/hJ6XmYw](https://postimg.cc/gallery/hJ6XmYw)\n\nNOTABLE EXAMPLES/DISCUSSION:\n\nLet\u2019s start with a control case; some nice boomer stocks that don\u2019t see a lot of manipulation or short sale pressure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[General Motors: Boring, stable, boomer](https://preview.redd.it/r8qiv1y4qf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e4c3acdb9427c8f40ea3c0aa417b3f271be19a9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AT&amp;T: Not great but not shorted either](https://preview.redd.it/5657rry6qf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34304850f0e9bc3de21aa7333d5a4ed455ae9440)\n\nGM, T: Volume and Short volume run in close sympathy but there are no days of positive delta volume which means the Cumulative SI line remains at 0 for the full graph.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll take a look at some \u2018typical\u2019 short selling pressure which does not seem too abnormal or excessive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMD: Short pressure but bounced back](https://preview.redd.it/7nouxvhbqf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc01af85255590228e00fa7f4a04802c0464106c)\n\nAMD: Influx of shorting in 2020 with a steady decrease back to 0.

On the bull side, there has been a fair amount of evidence detailing options manipulation, dark pool orders, and possible naked shorting that isn\u2019t making it to the official FINRA and SEC reports. We\u2019ve also learned that the maximum reported short interest is 140% and its not impossible that back in May 2020 (I see you, Jim Bell) they may have doubled down on synthetic shares and naked shorting such that that the \u201csmall\u201d \\~100 million share jump around the beginning of May reflected in the official numbers should actually extend significantly higher and trend further up as the shorts continued to pile on and try to drive them into the ground until they were forced to allow the price to spike and shut off many brokers\u2019 buy buttons to cancel the short squeeze at that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[XRT: that's a pretty short basket of bananas](https://preview.redd.it/d9rp2o4drf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb2ccd726b26a57282e6c078aace64c913711bd)\n\nXRT: Everyone\u2019s favorite basket of magic tricks. I don\u2019t know what to think here other than this can\u2019t be good for an ETF to be overshorted more or less *all the time.*\n\nCONCLUSION/THEORIES:\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack in this. A marked difference exists in the behavior of the \u2018cumulative SI\u2019 trend between \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018meme\u2019 stocks. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s a coincidence that there are a number of stocks that follow nearly identical price trends and have very similar graphs \u2013 KOSS and GME are a perfect example of this from January through now, though with some noticeable differences since Feburary.  I believe that there are some clear trends you can see in the graphs that begin to paint a picture showing a large institutional entity running short sale campaigns against one or more companies/tickers either simultaneously or in serial in an attempt to profit off of price action and retail order manipulation. The campaign which started in 2019 when Jim Bell came on board to GME, that appears to have included a number of other \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which all saw sympathetic squeeze action in January/February 2021 and where several continue today, is an example of a massive miscalculation and error of risk management by one or more institutions.\n\nIn short, squeezes are back on the menu boys.

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve recently started analyzing data from FINRA and the SEC in an attempt to determine a \u2018worst case\u2019 scenario for short interest. Initially I was focusing on GME and other meme stocks, but have also applied the same technique to the broader S&amp;P500 index list as well with some interesting results.\n\nFINRA Short Volume information scraped from: [http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-June.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-June.html)\n\nSEC FTD Data scraped from: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)\n\nLike any good math problem, we need to prove our work. There are a few fields that we receive from the data feeds that can be used for further calculations. The most notable ones for this case are Short Volume, Short Exempt Volume, Total Volume, and FTD per day by ticker. Short Volume and FTD are likely familiar with those reading this, but Short Exempt volume may not be.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)\n\nMATHS:\n\nRegular Volume = Total Volume \u2013 Short Volume  \nTotal Short Volume = Short Volume + Short Exempt Volume  \nDelta Volume = Total Short Volume \u2013 Regular Volume  \nCumulative SI = Cumulative SI + Delta Volume\n\nIf Cumulative SI dips to negative, reset to 0\n\nShort Volume Percent = Total Short Volume / Total Volume\n\nASSUMPTION:\n\nThis calculation is conservative and a worst case scenario for the retail investor. The assumption made is that any trade that is in excess of the daily short volume is used to close a prior short sale \u2013 i.e. no retail or investor buying or holding. The goal is to identify situations where abusive or excessive shorting may be happening, and to visually identify shorting and volume trends between tickers.\n\nCAVEATS:\n\nThe data is incomplete, the data is outright wrong, the rules are made up and the points don\u2019t matter. From FINRA\u2019s site directly: \n\n* Short Sale Volume excludes any trading activity that is not publicly disseminated. As a result, some      offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily Volume  and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale volume to total volume.\n* The Short Sale Volume is not consolidated with exchange data. To obtain a complete picture of the short sale volume to total volume for a particular exchange-listed stock, market participants must combine data from each of the TRFs and the ADF, as well as from each exchange.\n* Short Sale Volume does not\u2014and is not intended to\u2014equate to bi-monthly reported short      interest position information. The short interest data reflects aggregate short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month, while the Daily Short Sale Volume reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed and reported as short sales on each trade date. \n\nAs a result, this approach is intended to give an indication of general short interest over time correlated with volume and price, and provide an easy to understand visual representation of short sale trends and worst case covering scenarios.  It is NOT an accurate SI estimate, even if you assume that the reported numbers are accurate and truthful.\n\nPROCESS:\n\nAfter scraping available SEC and FINRA feeds for each relevant ticker, the data is merged and run through a fairly simple python script to calculate the missing fields and plot out using numpy and pandas.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nRH Halts, two GME ETFs, and a few controls:  [https://postimg.cc/gallery/z3NGnx9](https://postimg.cc/gallery/z3NGnx9) \n\nS&amp;P 500:  [https://postimg.cc/gallery/hJ6XmYw](https://postimg.cc/gallery/hJ6XmYw) \n\nNOTABLE EXAMPLES/DISCUSSION:\n\nLet\u2019s start with a control case; some nice boomer stocks that don\u2019t see a lot of manipulation or short sale pressure.\n\n[General Electric, Boring, stable, boomer town](https://preview.redd.it/vy66v74ckf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3bfbcad32cf08a588d8477c014689e75da8f211)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AT&amp;T, took a kick last year but not from being overly shorted](https://preview.redd.it/8syr6hcfkf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e68e852d73c872ea12ba5651f1d406f5397e55fe)\n\nGM, T: Volume and Short volume run in close sympathy but there are no days of positive delta volume which means the Cumulative SI line remains at 0 for the full graph. \n\nNext, we\u2019ll take a look at some \u2018typical\u2019 short selling pressure which does not seem too abnormal or excessive.\n\n[AMD, Heavy shorting but a fairly reasonable slope on both up and down trend](https://preview.redd.it/581g0rljkf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e01618c90f9724970458b3716ce92c0e31acea6)\n\nAMD: Influx of shorting in 2020 with a steady decrease back to 0.

This short backlog tops the graph at \\~140,000,000 and is already back up to \\~60,000,000 on paper alone](https://preview.redd.it/e5lljsh8tf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb387c4196cbbe4500930608d7b210c266dcd80b)\n\nGME: Two ways to interpret this, depending on how much tin foil you have on. \n\n1) On the bear side, it lends some credence to the \u2018bUt ThE sHoRtS cLoSeD!\u2019 narrative, if you only look at it from the perspective of the officially reported data and what the graph shows. It also indicates a massive resurgence of short interest that hasn\u2019t gone away and is at a significantly higher entry price, so I\u2019d argue a short squeeze is still on the menu even based on this. \n\n2) On the bull side, there has been a fair amount of evidence detailing options manipulation, dark pool orders, and possible naked shorting that isn\u2019t making it to the official FINRA and SEC reports. We\u2019ve also learned that the maximum reported short interest is 140% and its not impossible that back in May 2020 (I see you, Jim Bell) they may have doubled down on synthetic shares and naked shorting such that that the \u201csmall\u201d \\~100 million share jump around the beginning of May reflected in the official numbers should actually extend significantly higher and trend further up as the shorts continued to pile on and try to drive them into the ground until they were forced to allow the price to spike and shut off many brokers\u2019 buy buttons to cancel the short squeeze at that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nothing to see here, move along](https://preview.redd.it/fqtc55uetf071.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e47630837bc2d65bfe11715ac44a6a4a6b42aaf)\n\nXRT: Everyone\u2019s favorite basket of magic tricks. I don\u2019t know what to think here other than this can\u2019t be good for an ETF to be overshorted more or less *all the time, when compared to its constituent stocks.*\n\nCONCLUSION/THEORIES:\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack in this. A marked difference exists in the behavior of the \u2018cumulative SI\u2019 trend between \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018meme\u2019 stocks. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s a coincidence that there are a number of stocks that follow nearly identical price trends and have very similar graphs \u2013 KOSS and GME are a perfect example of this from January through now.  I believe that there are some clear trends you can see in the graphs that begin to paint a picture showing a large institutional entity running short sale campaigns against one or more companies/tickers either simultaneously or in serial in an attempt to profit off of price action and retail order manipulation. The campaign which started in 2019 when Jim Bell came on board to GME, that appears to have included a number of other \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which all saw sympathetic squeeze action in January/February 2021 and where several continue today, is an example of a massive miscalculation and error of risk management by one or more institutions.\n\nIn short, squeezes are back on the menu boys.
