Its late to the game in cloud, but it does have a tight grip on the mainframe market because the government and many other companies will not give up their mainframes.",

        "selftext": "Buy and hold! and accumulate much as you can while they keep the stock price low. \n\ni know many of us are armed with Robinhood and we're trigger happy with buy/sell but if you want to win you must learn to buy and hold. Yes, Blackberry is one of those stock. In my view it's massively undervalued Cyber Security and IoT company. Their Blackberry Spark platform is taking over everything and overtaking Crowdstrike business too. How i make this assessment? Simple, if Crowdstrike was a good technology compnay the entire US federal government would be using it....BUT there're NOT! they are going to Blackberry.  **Blackberry has integrated artificial intelligence into all their products now.** \n\nEven IBM has decided to ditch their own cyber security software and switched to selling Blackberry Spark suite in Canada. When one of your biggest competitor ditches their own product and starts selling your product, that's a sign that you have an amazing crazy magic like product. \n\n[here's the proof](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-and-ibm-canada-establish-a-new-partnership)\n\nCompared to industry the blackberry spark artificial intelligence machine is years in advance. **No other** ai based cyber security comes close to blackberry engine, this is why US government and 77% of fortune 100 companies have switched to blackberry. i will list their growing customers(big enterprises) in next part. **BB holds the biggest ai patent portfolio in cyber security!!**\n\nRevenue growth will explode in coming months and quarters. The ai based spark platform was launched last year and it took them few months to get their ducks and marketing in row! \n\nNext article i will dive deep into their latest product called Blackberry Persona! it's a god like ai that stops insider threats and stolen password(the pipeline hack could have been prevented if they had used blackberry). Password will be history and no longer will be required as we move into the future. \n\n**if we compare valuation to peers, the company should be around 70 Billion minimum or about $140 per share.** \n\nNot a financial advice.

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been following AMD since it was a $30 little boy share, and I\u2019ve always believed in it long. Looking at its history, you can see the annual returns over the last five years have been great. But here\u2019s why this particular autist really likes this stock. But first, a bit of backstory about AMD.\n\n###Who is AMD and why do we care?\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices** (AMD) is a computer hardware development and manufacturing company at its core. They design and sell Processors, GPUs, APUs, and the like. For anyone who has been into gaming or building PCs, you\u2019d probably recognize AMD as the \u201cbudget build\u201d: the company who\u2019s processors you buy when you don\u2019t want to shell out $900 for a top shelf Intel. They have always been seen as an underdog in Intel\u2019s shadow, with Intel having the superior clock speeds, Hyperthreading tech, and better clout when it comes to contracting.\n\n###Next Gen Consoles\n\nCurrently the latest gaming consoles are the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, both being relatively impossible to get your hands on due to the microchip shortage (more on that later). *AMD powers both.*\n\nLet that sink in. AMD has no competition for this generation of video game consoles. Every PS5 and Xbox X that gets built, AMD gets a chunk of that change. This is basically guaranteed profit for the life of the console, historically that\u2019s about 6-7 more years.\n\n###Server Hardware\n\nAMD has been expanding their server hardware lineup, and their biggest competitor Intel has dropped the ball on this one: their new server hardware isn\u2019t rolling out til Q1 2022. Meanwhile, Google is replacing outdated hardware with AMD processors. This is a big step for AMD, because it puts them in the position of no longer being the underdog, and gives them juicy, profitable market share.\n\n###CEO Lisa Su\n\nLisa Su is an awesome woman. She has a diverse background including Texas Instruments and IBM, and since she took the reigns of AMD in 2014, the stock has soared. She helped diversify their product line success, and saw the immense benefit of getting AMD server chips licensed in China.\n\n###The future of work\n\nLots of people see the future of work moving towards a larger working from home model (anecdotal). Working from home requires hardware, and people buying hardware prefer to spend less if they can, and this is the hardware AMD specializes in.\n\n###Semiconductor Shortage\n\nThe massive demand for semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops to servers has been a drag on literally the entire economy. Auto manufactory lines in Midwest America are at a standstill while car lots are barren of new vehicles because of the world\u2019s \u201cjust in time\u201d production model collapsing under increased demand.\n\nI personally believe this shortage is artificially holding down the price of AMD, as big money is slower to invest in a company that could potentially suffer from the shortage. Once things pick back up, there is a lot of potential for accelerated movement upwards as things become available to the public for purchase.\n\nAMD is a preferred client of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), which has invested billions into additional manufacturing capacity.\n\n###Get on the train before it leaves!\n\nOnce these processors start shipping out, the profits will roll in and sentiment will return. Boarding this rocket begins now! \ud83e\udd8d \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d \n\nI hold 100 shares @84 average and some 12/17/21 $155 calls.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m profoundly autistic, my late wife\u2019s second boyfriend told me so. This is not financial advice, I am retarded.",

        "selftext": "Palantir. Love it. Hate it. You will never stop hearing about it. And here's why.\n\nPalantir was created for a world that didn't exist yet. A world where information and data would become so large no human workforce could ever be able to manage it effectively let alone, extrapolate insight from. So what's data do? It either sits there, or becomes a parasite on you for companies like google and facebook to target your dollars in the form of user specific ads. This way of utilizing data is indeed parasitic, and Palantir rejects this use of data in everyway possible.\n\nBut what if data wasn't used to fuck over your own customers, but instead used to help save them money and resources. Perhaps their lives? Restore supply chains, accelerate cancer research, and help restore the world to (somewhat) normalcy post pandemic. The sophisticated tools required to manage this type of data would have been inconceivable. No one predicated this kind of disjunction. Well. maybe some, but no company that would sacrifice half their revenue in R &amp; D to solve problems of this magnitude they may or may not come to fruition. No one. Except 1 company. Valued at less than 1 billion back in 2010, then up to 9 billion in 2013 and 20 billion in 2015. And as high as 41 billion right before becoming public. Palantir 40x in 10 years is impressive, but its total addressable market would suggest a runaway so large and growing so fast that those returns are far from over. \n\nHow big is this market? Well. Looking at the S-1 Filings it's estimated to be 119 billion. This is broken down into 63 billion in government and 56 billion in commercial. This is less than a fucking percent. How fast is it expanding? Well the S-1 is old news in my opinion of the \"macrotrend\" that Alex Karp says is happening.  \n\nThis comes from COO Shyam Sankar himself...\n\n \"And -- and with our investments in the end-to-end, sensor-to-shooter workflows from space to mud, we're not just going after the roughly $60 billion of government IT spend anymore, we're talking about the quarter-trillion dollars of U.S. DOD weapons system spend in 2020.\"\n\nThis is fucking huge. And is completely overfucking looked. Everyone is still looking at the S1 filings about PLTR's TAM and its just wrong, it's so far much more now. This is why perhaps that government revenue is actually picking up at a more rapid pace despite it being their main customer base to this date. Government revenue grew at 68% YoY in Q3 2020 and in Q1 2021 it was 72 percent (With US revenue at 83%).\n\nAll-in-all I believe that a price to sales ratio of 40 is completely justified. This TAM is most definitely expanding into the commercial space as well. As IBM pointed out, 90% of all data has been generated in the last 2 years alone. This means that the data is growing faster then people can analyze it. This is where software like Palantir will be crucial in the future. What we're seeing with covid is all but just 1 example of how Palantir has been preparing for a future of disjunction. Palantir's investments only exacerbates  the obviousness of the problem the large amounts of disperse data creates. They're putting their money where their mouth is by not only putting half of their revenue into R&amp;D  (561 Million, up 100% from 2018)  but taking whatever's left over into data-intensive business startups that utilize Palantir software. These actions of SPAC investments are probably more or less on Peter Thiel's part considering he's created the Founder's Fund and has a track record of picking innovative companies. This doesn't suggest that Palantir is slowing down and that Palantir simply doesn't know where to put their money, but they're more or less trying to plant seeds in industries and sectors that they are wanting to penetrate. Not only could they see significant returns that startups that succeed bring about, but also an increase in reputation and a testament of Palantir's usefulness in that sector. They want to make examples like BP saving 50 million in the first 2 weeks to potentially a billion a year off using Palantir's software become the Rule and not the Exception to the Rule. Palantir's usefulness is not 'niche' but can be applied across any sector.\n\nI don't want to consider this DD as I barely did any research that I'm sure most of you guys already didn't know. My main point here is the counter argument to Palantir's valuation. And the skepticism surrounding its potential slow down in the future. In my opinion, Palantir and their competitors aren't growing as fast as the TAM and that's why I don't expect to see revenue both on commercial or government to grow slower than 45% in a couple years when the entire commercial sector will start to generate so much data that they'll have to switch to something new then their own built in piece by piece enterprise software that simply just doesn't work. This is the reoccurring problem Palantir has on it's sales side. It's not other software enterprise companies that they mainly compete with, but their own customers they try to build their own systems.  If they can get this much revenue from less than 200 customers (not to mention that the top 20 customers continue to pay 30%+ more for their subscriptions on a YoY basis) then any fear of a slowdown should not be on your mind when deciding whether or not to purchase Palantir stock. \n\nMy main concern for Palantir is ironically how much cash it has. I say ironic because Peter Thiel ripped in Googles cash hoard saying they aren't innovative enough to know how to use their 50 billion cash hoard. Now Palantir only has 2.3 billion cash but there market cap is much smaller than Googles back in 2012 when their massive cash hoard was addressed. (50 billion Vs Googles 270 billion). Now this cash hoard isn't nearly as severe and a drag as google's through the forces of inflation but it does pose some headwind if they cannot utilize it in innovative ways. Now Palantir has invested in 4 additional SPACs that I'm aware of since their ER (Perhaps 5, Idk if the \"partnership\" with Primer includes a PIPE investment) and perhaps we may actually see a decrease next quarter on their cash on hand which I'm not opposed to, as long as its being reinvested in some way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Palantir may be a multibillion dollar company but the the billions of dollars spent on R&amp;D are just now beginning to pay as the macrotrends are beginning to point closer and closer to companies like Palantir to be the next solution to the next problems that will plague the world in the not too distant future.\n\nPositions 4882 shares @ $24.01 cost basis",

        "selftext": "As a sequel to \"10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM\", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.\n\nStarting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),\n\n1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . \"Growth at a Reasonable Price\" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or \"TTM\" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!\n\nMoving on to Factor ETFs,\n\n2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.\n\n3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.\n\n4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.  \n\n5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.\n\n6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles \"quality\" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for \"profitability\", \"solvency and financial risk\", and \"earnings quality\".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.\n\nLet us not forget commodities,\n\n7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and \"flat\" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.\n\n8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.\n\nSeeking dividends?\n\n9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.\n\nFinally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,\n\n10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.\n\nDisclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?",

        "selftext": "We are told that if we can\u2019t do our homework for at least one hour per week per security we have no business in buying a stock. Yet there are many people who ignore this time proven lesson. We follow gut and the herds. Having said all this no one in their right mind should\u2019ve bought AMZN 10 years ago. I remember all the smart money not going after AMZN. Their valuation didn\u2019t make sense. That\u2019s why I waited until it was $1000 per share. Missed the boat? Nope. For a long term investor the fundamentals have to make sense. \n\nIt\u2019s the business model. If you want quick wins you can always go to Vegas. Of course any form of investing (specially in individual securities) is a bet. A gamble. But some bets are worth making. Know your risk level and then it all makes sense. \n\nPatience is also very important. Look TOYOTA came back from a terrible downturn after the unintended acceleration fiasco. So did VW. Any large company can temporarily lose its way or get unlucky (unless you\u2019re IBM or AT&amp;T). Sometimes you may have to cut the bait. \n\nWhat I do know is this: set a lower limit on how much you\u2019re willing to lose and stay disciplined. Or just buy the S&amp;P500. \ud83e\udd14",

        "selftext": "Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.\n\nLong before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention \u2014 first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.\n\nAnd that's where we see a major opportunity.\n\nBlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle \"the Enterprise of Things.\" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.\n\nIf your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.\n\nSecond Bloom!\n\nIt's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 \u2014 and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.\n\nBut this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.\n\nBlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.\n\nBut the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.\n\nThe company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. \n\nStill Green!\n\nThat hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.\n\nSince being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).\n\nAdd it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.\n\nRisks and When We'd Sell!\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&amp;D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors \u2014 companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others \u2014 have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line!\n\nNot every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is \"largely done reinventing itself\" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know \u2014 he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected \"things\" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past. That's a sweet opportunity.",

The company provides software-as-a-service applications that enable customers to rapidly develop, deploy, and operate large-scale Enterprise AI applications across any infrastructure. It provides solutions under three divisions namely:\n\n* The C3 AI Suite: proprietary model-driven architecture, addresses the requirements for the digital transformation software stack, providing a low-code/no-code AI and Internet of Things, or IoT, platform that accelerates software development, reduces cost and risk, and delivers applications that are flexible enough to meet evolving needs.\n* C3 AI Applications: a large and growing family of industry-specific and application-specific turnkey AI solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed such as:\n   * Inventory Optimization: a solution to optimize raw material, in-process, and finished goods inventory levels\n   * Supply Network Risk: provides visibility into risks of disruption throughout the supply chain operations for enterprise supply chain managers\n   * Customer Churn Management: enables account executives and relationship managers to monitor customer satisfaction using transactional, behavioral, and contextual information, as well as to take action to prevent customer churn with AI-based and human-interpretable predictions and warning\n   * Production Schedule Optimization: a solution for scheduling production \n   * Predictive Maintenance: provides insight into asset risk to maintenance planners and equipment operators\n   * Fraud Detection solution\n   * Energy Management solution \n* C3.ai Ex Machina: analytics for applying data science to every-day business decisions\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zudwz718ew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12d05673719c96e4bce13e8389d0f2c8a63f3006)\n\nC3 is growing rapidly with a total revenue of $156.7M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $91.6M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 representing a year-over-year growth of 71%. Over the same period, the subscription revenue grew to $135.4M from $77.5M representing a 75% increase.\n\nC3 has high total contract values for software subscriptions. The average total subscription contract values were:\n\n* 2016: $1.2M\n* 2017: $11.7M\n* 2018: $10.8M\n* 2019: $16.2M\n* 2020: $12.1M\n\n**BULL ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 has a first-mover advantage in Enterprise AI due to investment into their products and technology over the last decade. They have \u201cLighthouse Customers\u201d, or large global early adopters, in Europe, Asia, and the United States across a range of industries that serve as proof points for other potential customers. Some customers include:\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6v6m5kedew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e44125b37976abacc041856b3b4fda5e7608a95)\n\nThere is an extensive partner ecosystem that includes strategic relationships with established technology leaders like:\n\n* [Amazon Web Services](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005314/en/C3-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Expand-Collaboration-to-Drive-Enterprise-Artificial-Intelligence-Adoption)\n* Fidelity National Information Services\n* [Google](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180821005202/en/C3-IoT-and-Google-Cloud-Announce-Partnership)\n* [IBM](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-27/correcting-and-replacing-ibm-services-and-c3-ai-announce-strategic-alliance-for-digital-transformation-with-ai)\n* [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/microsoft-sees-gain-on-c3ai-investment-concurrent-with-ipo.html)\n\nAlthough the average total subscription value is decreasing and may continue to decrease, C3 has restructured the sales organization and expanded the market-partner ecosystem to address small, medium, and large sales opportunities. The progress is promising as the average total subscription contract value for six months ended October 31, 2020 was $7.7M.\n\nOn February 1, 2021, the [launch of the Open AI Energy Initiative](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-c3-ai-baker-hughes-220000073.html) was announced by Shell, C3, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft. The initiative provides a framework for energy operators, service providers, equipment providers, and independent software vendors for energy services to offer interoperable solutions powered by the [BHC3 AI Suite](https://bakerhughesc3.ai/bhc3-ai-suite/model-driven-architecture/) and Microsoft Azure.\n\n**BEAR ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 faces intense competition and which could be an \u201cearly bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese\u201d type of situation as second movers could develop technology to improve upon any shortfalls. The main sources of potential competition include:\n\n* Greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases\n* Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing across a broader portfolio\n* Wider geographic presence\n* Lower labor and research and development costs\n* Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios\n* Greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, hire talent, and to develop and introduce new products\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel has received many [honors and awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181112005818/en/EY-Honors-Thomas-M.-Siebel-as-2018-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year%C2%AE), but if he, or other senior management team members, were to leave the company C3 may not be able to execute their business strategy. Siebel is critical to the overall management and continued development of the AI suite and AI Applications. All of the executive officers are at-will employees and they do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\n\nC3 has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. The sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense. This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organization structure, and approval requirements. A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3\u2019s revenue. The top three entities together accounted for 34% and 44% of the revenue for years ended April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3.3 years.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nGiven the success of C3\u2019s customers, I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base. They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements. Additionally, C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses. I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams. The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to $271B in 2024, a 12% CAGR from 2020's estimate of $174B.  This is a big opportunity for C3.  The lock up period [ended on June 7, 2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=907559-94759), and earnings happened on June 2, 2021. I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point. I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade, but more so a long-term investment. \n\n*I am not a financial advisor.

I have coded the change of open interest to determine when this position was made, and if it was made all at once. To the right of the picture below, you can see that this position was placed between 15-20 trading days prior (OI (-15/-20Days). AKA 3-4 weeks prior, which puts us at the week prior to their fillings, May 17th. Like I said, these fillings were reported on May 21st.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow what about the call? They are tied into 1,822,200 shares or about (18k call contracts). Now again, looking at the coded option chain data, you can see that once again there was a position placed again for the 20 Call of this weeks, 6/18 expiration. The open interest increased to 18,513 15 days ago, or again, right at the time of Citadels fillings on May 21st.\n\nAs per u/JulianFranklin \"They sold 18,000 call contracts with a $20 strike price. That means they are promising to SELL 1.8 million shares (18,000 contracts X 100 shares per contract) at $20 each. That means, if WKHS finishes Friday at less than $20 they don't have to do anything, all the money they made selling the options is pure profit. Remember, options don't exist until someone sells them. An option is just a promise to either buy or sell at a later date under certain conditions. If the conditions aren't met by the timeline in the promise, then the option vanishes and the person who sold it wins. Now to the REAL part of your question...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCitadel wins if WKHS finishes above $9 and below $20. For every dollar ABOVE $20 that WKHS gets to by Friday closing bell, Citadel will lose $1.8 million (less whatever they were paid when they sold the option). So if WKHS goes to $25.55 at closing bell, Citadel loses $10 million. If it goes to $31.11 they lose $20 million. If WKHS goes to $50, they lose $54 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA protective collar strategy is performed by purchasing an out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously writing an out-of-the-money call option. The underlying asset and the expiration date must be the same. This strategy is often used by investors after a long position in a stock has experienced substantial gains. This allows investors to have downside protection as the long put helps lock in the potential sale price. However, the trade-off is that they may be obligated to sell shares at a higher price, thereby forgoing the possibility for further profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of this strategy is if an investor is long on 100 shares of IBM at $50 and suppose that IBM rises to $100 as of January 1. The investor could construct a protective collar by selling one IBM March 105 call and simultaneously buying one IBM March 95 put. The trader is protected below $95 until the expiration date. The trade-off is that they may potentially be obligated to sell their shares at $105 if IBM trades at that rate prior to expiry.\n\nThe main drawback of this strategy is that the investor is giving away upside in the stock in exchange for obtaining downside protection. The protective collar works like a charm if the stock declines, but not so well if the stock surges ahead and is \"called away,\" as any additional gain above the call strike price will be lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore details can be found here [https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/nyxnrj/fellow\\_ape\\_brothers\\_and\\_sisters\\_of\\_wkhs\\_we\\_must/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf&amp;utm\\_term=link](https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/nyxnrj/fellow_ape_brothers_and_sisters_of_wkhs_we_must/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_term=link)",

        "selftext": "So all you apes know everything there is to know about why you should buy Palantir, right? Great product, mini CIA, the future is AI, blah blah and you all know the risks too: expensive, mini CIA, idealogical restrictions that prevent global sales (for now), never made a profit, blah blah\n\nBut I come to you not as a palantir employee, user, developer or enthusiast...rather, as someone who loves the stock and hates the company - I am * drumroll * the competition.\n\nI sell AI and Analytics platforms for a living. And these fuckers are steamrolling us at every turn. It's gotten to the point where I tell my sales team that if pltr is invited to the bid, don't bother putting too much time and energy into the proposal until and unless you have an \"in\" with the buyer. And that too, if you have a serious \"in\" at that. They have no competition and it's beginning to feel like we are being invited just to prevent the appearance of bias in contracts being awarded to them. It's THAT lopsided. It's frustrating as fuck, but serious buyers know that their platform is top notch and are willing to pay, even when our pricing is, in some cases, 50% lower. Think about that.\n\nSo yeah I hate them cause they have single handedly ruined my bonus pay for last year and will probably do so this year too. But I love the stock and I still think it's early days and this will be a 10-30 bagger in the years to come. Note, I said years. This is not a meme stock, this is the seed money for your retirement villa in the Maldives or Mars or wherever the fuck it is that you wanna go to die.\n\nMy company is publicly listed and do you know how many shares and options of theirs I've bought till date after $pltr listed last year? Diddly fucking squat.\n\n I've been telling my CEO to partner with them (like IBM did - do you know what an admission of defeat that is? To throw Watson in the toilet after all those yrs and to go eat humble pie with pltr? But good for them, it's a move that will be a win win for everyone involved) but with CEOs, the biggest problem is that they often respect only one opinion - their own.\n\nOn the other hand with Papa Karp, I now hold 500 shares at an avg of 18, and have a whole fistful of 8/20 40c and another fistful of 1/23 50c to keep my beak wet and will only keep adding to my long hold portfolio (At one point my entire portfolio was Palantir but ape got out at that $40 point earlier this yr to buy a house for wife's boyfriend and now rebuilding my holdings again)\n\nMy current strategy is to use yolo proceeds where successful to buy more pltr. By end of this year I hope to be back to my original 10,000 shares and put it away and never sell it until it hits that 30x return I'm convinced is not too far away.

Its server business was under serious threat with the advent of cloud computing; its personal computing and productivity business were... stagnant, to say the least.\n\nBut with the help of its scale, MSFT reoriented its entire towards new business models like cloud and SaaS. It opened up its Azure platform like AWS, and transformed Office into a huge ARR generating machine. The result? Its share price appreciation and valuation speak for themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, IBM decided to double down on its on-prem centric business, paddling products like hybrid and private cloud. They decided to focus on their relationship with large accounts and didn't advertise their platform to the burdgeoning startup community. The result?

They bought Pluto, which enables Adwords-like targetted advertising; consolidated their vast media assets into P+; and reconstituted the entire company's leadership to focus more on streaming.\n\nWill VIAC become more of a MSFT or an IBM in the age streaming?

        "selftext": "Why I think BB is legit\n\nHonest View on BB\n\nApe Research Analyst Report on BB: To the Moon\n\nWhat's up apes, I know the last couple weeks have been life-changing for some of us. As a grad student who grew up on the lower end of the middle class, I recognize how pumped some fo you must feel and commend everyone's brass balls- it's never easy to make money in a casino as heavily manipulated as the free market that is the USA. But turning to BB: it was never meant to be just some squeeze (although its end result could technically be called that if you really wanted too)- it's a retooling company embedded in a crucial sector to the modern global economy.\n\nAnd so while some of us have become capable of retirement in recent weeks, I want to talk about a name that is on the cusp of a resurrection.\n\n# For BB Holders, it's been tough lately.\n\nMany people have harsh memories of Blackberry: it was on the cusp of bankruptcy as recently as 2015. Revenue growth sunk from $20B at its peak in 2011 (82% hardware sales) to under a $1B in the 2010s; $BB stock sunk from a peak of $146 in 2008 to single digits, thanks to negative cash flows and rapidly declining top line growth.\n\n[Not surprising BB ate shit for so long- this useless Etch-a-Sketch was 82&amp;#37; of their revenue in 2011!](https://preview.redd.it/w7dt7c4bwd371.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80e0a1b70f7bad3078d8bb3d3982d69b1d12f1bb)\n\n[It's been a long, tough run for Blackberry shareholders since they ended hardware production\\/sales. The stock has been largely irrelevant for years, falling from a peak of $146 in May 2008 to single digits \\&lt; $5B market cap. But its transition into a cybersecurity company is only beginning to pay fruit, which I believe the market will catch on to very soon. Times are a-changing!](https://preview.redd.it/f5zqz58dwd371.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763644f3ae3cc922a25d1e06d7d0a295ae5d5ed9)\n\n# A Rebranded Business for the Digital Economy\n\nLike we've seen with the Chads in Gamestoink, successful companies are the ones willing to renounce their fading legacy businesses and embrace initiatives and industries that sit on the cusp of the digital age. Enter Blackberry. Now we all remember Blackberry's legacy business- the handheld pagers that looked like shit, but only quirky people embraced (POTUS and CEOs used Blackberry pagers over iPhones for the longest of times, until Blackberry discontinued its hardware line).\n\nHowever, the primary focus for Blackberry has never changed. Blackberry was always security-centric, and with the installation of CEO John S. Chen in 2013, Blackberry pivoted towards software- a trend that was always going to happen given Apple's prowess in manufacturing superior smartphones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[John S. Chen's my homie. If you're scared about holding BB bags, just reassure yourself that that chin can hold both yours and his. But seriously, he's an innovator, having been credited with \\\\\"Saving Blackberry\\\\\"- pay attention, his vision doesn't end with subsistence.](https://preview.redd.it/l39tl9rfwd371.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ee66024cfba9e04ea1566f5690aeb57ecd2497)\n\nBut like Ryan Cohen with Gamestop/Chewy, Blackberry recognized it needed to adapt to survive, and that's exactly what it has done under Chen's stewardship. A glimpse at Blackberry today is far different than the pioneer that once controlled 20%+ of the mobile hardware market.\n\n[Revenues have intuitively followed a similar trajectory as Blackberry's market cap. But the transformation under Chen's leadership so far is tangible: after hardware sales alone accounted for 82&amp;#37; of revenue in 2011, the company made a wide U-turn. After establishing \\(and meeting\\) a goal for fiscal 2020 revenue to top $1B again, hardware has fallen to just \\~3&amp;#37; of sales. Enterprise software \\(44&amp;#37;\\), Licensing &amp; IP \\(31&amp;#37;\\), and Technology Solutions \\(22&amp;#37;\\) now dominate BB's topline as of 2020, cementing its push and admittance to the cybersecurity market.](https://preview.redd.it/u9mg373iwd371.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8790440834c2d2f933eb88018fa6971d95ce0e)\n\n# So what does Blackberry actually do now?\n\nTo be clear, the only people walking around with Blackberry \"phones\" nowadays are old junkies trying to revive some 2000s nostalgia. Blackberry doesn't make that archaic crap anymore. All you need to remember are three phrases when thinking about the new Blackberry: **enterprise software, licensing IP,** and **technology solutions**.\n\n* **Enterprise software** is one of the fastest growing components of BB's cybersecurity offering. It includes products like the Blackberry Enterprise Mobility Suite, which provides endpoint management and BlackBerry AtHoc, a secure communications platform.\n* **Licensing IP** is the segment responsible for the monetization of the Company\u2019s global patent portfolio as well as the mobility licensing operations, which license the BlackBerry brand and device software to handset vendors.\n* **Technology Solutions** is the business that includes BlackBerry QNX embedded software as well as several emerging businesses such as the BlackBerry Radar fleet management solutions.\n\nExciting Partnerships, Soaring Ambitions\n\n*\\*\\*You should really take a look at some of Blackberry's partnerships in the last 2 years- this is not a company that makes shitty pagers anymore, it's the company that embodies \"digital transformation.\"*\n\nTake a look at some of the companies Blackberry is sleeping with and tell me your smooth gorilla brain doesn't swell:\n\n* **Baidu** has an extensive partnership with BB in its autonomous vehicle unit, dating back to 2018. In January 2018, the two companies announced they would [partner](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) to utilize Blackberry QNX's OS as the backbone of Baidu's autonomous system. Blackberry also agreed to help Baidu integrate smartphone integration software for Chinese connected cars (CarLife), conversational AI (DuerOS), and HD maps. In January 2021, these two [expanded](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) their relationship: Blackberry's QNX Neutrino Real-Time OS is being utilized for all future EV models produced with the EV branch of GAC (Guangzhou Automotive Group, yes the C isn't a typo). Pretty exciting stuff to say the least..\n* **Motional**, which is a Hyundai backed AV startup, [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform) in February 2021 its intentions to use BB's Black Channel communications technology for all of Motional's future AVs. A very integral input for Motional and impressive win for Blackberry, being able to ensure safe data communication exchanges within vehicle safety systems is essential for AVs' successful integration in society... otherwise where is the trust in accepting that ride? Not to mention that Apple (*the Tim Apple*) was chirping around with Hyundai and Kia, talking about making a \"smart car,\" *earlier this year!* I guess all the ape memes about Blackberry being a legitimate competitor to Apple shouldn't be sneezed at by Wall St equity research analysts and BB \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs...\n* **AWS**, yes Amazon Web Services (!), is another credible player lining up with Blackberry. Although not quite as exciting as building actual AVs, the work they do is still essential to ensure this dream can actually be realized. In December 2020, the two Chads [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) a multi-year partnership to develop BB's IVY platform (Intelligent Vehicle Data, yes the \"Y\" is weird, but makes sense for ape leadership), allowing automakers to read sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from the data both in the vehicle and in the cloud.\n\nTake it from Amazon's new CEO, Andy Jassy himself: *\u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences. Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d*\n\n[These geniuses love Blackberry, starting with their most intelligent, scalable business: AWS! Shouldn't you apes like BB as well?](https://preview.redd.it/ktha1d7nwd371.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b2415869531f1cf47f9c54b6d6e668c252877)\n\nBut why should I stop there? I'm tired of seeing fear-mongering Wall Street hedge funds, investment bankers, and research analysts attempting to push their positions (BB's primary competitors are IBM, Microsoft, VMware, and Mobile Iron, the former 3 of which are all significantly owned by \"institutions\" - &gt;75%) and allege Blackberry is a dying business that makes crappy hardware.\n\n* **Microsoft** (Yes its rival!) even realizes its budding competitor is crafting innovative solutions, announcing a partnership in [October 2020](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management) for Microsoft Teams! Microsoft plans to integrate Blackberry AtHoc, which will allow organizations on Teams to contact, alert, and account for all members of their group directly through Teams should some calamity transpire. Especially as we witness more cyber attacks (the digital economy's biggest threat will stem from this), it will be an all hands-on-deck effort to safeguard the integrity of our software. BB's partnership with Microsoft (and [ServiceNow](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-and-servicenow-partner-to-deliver-secure-and-re) for incident response management) not only grounds its strong advance to cybersecurity industry disruption, but its diverse agility to penetrate various sectors, ranging from AV/EV, CRM software, IoT, 5G, and so much more.\n* If the corporate pedigree isn't enough for you, I'll end with the **U.S. Air Force**. No, unlike what bulge bracket banks may lead you to believe, BB's revenue stream is well-diversified, as the USAF [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity) a partnership in September 2020. Blackberry Spark, utilized for UEM and UES, will help the Air Force with their secure productivity needs, enabling virtual work environments whilst ensuring premium security. As we face more threats in the cyber space and continue pivoting towards a \"work-from-home environment\" regardless of the permanent trends form Covid, BB's wide-ranging partnerships, from Fortune 500 tech companies to the U.S. military prove it is an essential cog in the 21st century digital economy. Not to mention consistent ARR is exactly what investors (the suits) should be looking for, so what gives with the nasty financial press?\n\n# Blackberry's Financial Trajectory (Revs, Bottom Line, CF)\n\nWe have to take a look at Blackberry's financials, after all that is what this casino allegedly runs on. Luckily, if we ignore what the \"experts\" in Battery Park are shilling, we'll notice Blackberry is not the capsizing Titanic all the research analysts make it out to be. I'll take you into a deeper dive into the top &amp; bottom line with just the facts and my brilliant takes, and y'all can make your own decision on whether BB stock is seriously a pile of rat shit or an emerging growth stud.\n\n[As you might expect, Blackberry's overall top line consistently declined until roughly 2020+ \\(when every single one of these dope partnerships was announced\\). As BB wound down its legacy hardware, handset, and related service products, sales declined nearly $400M over the course of final two years, a marked decline from the near $20B struck in 2011. This trend seems to be on the reverse though: the new partnerships in 2020\\/21 have certainly underscored BB's transition into a software company, a trend even Wall St has had to acknowledge by lifting growth targets for fiscal year 2021. IMO, the $1.2B projected top line figure for '21 is conservative, and I think these figures could start to double, triple, and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in 2024+. Let me explain why with more charts:](https://preview.redd.it/3pq5gyspwd371.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a643492be05c1ec2f4830bd0b66b180276b6b3)\n\n[All those dope corporate and military partnerships I highlighted earlier? They mainly fit into BB's Enterprise software\\/services revenue stream, which is now 44&amp;#37; of overall revenue. This is the first component that I believe is going to drive revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and tendies for us and BB in the years to come. We'll first notice that growth in this space really picked up in 2020 for BB, similarly to when their overall topline reversed trend- because this is the soul of 2021 Blackberry! And no, this doesn't even really include the innovative AV\\/EV partnerships, these are just institutional clients like Microsoft, ServiceNow, or Salesforce who want to buy one of Blackberry's SaaS established offerings. Think of the potential addressable market in the years to come: work from home, AI, 5G, IoT, we can keep going- all of these things need to be protected, without security, there is no system- every software, hardware, and appliance company under the sun is going to be lining up because they have no choice. You are adapt or go extinct. I expect BB to continue driving this aspect of its growth in a gargantuan way: think 25-50&amp;#37; growth YoY.](https://preview.redd.it/m106ixxswd371.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e12724037bc3b9f099ab2859bea4b6608f00ee)\n\n[If Enterprise Software is to be Blackberry's Patrick Mahomes, Technology Solutions will be Blackberry's Tom Brady. Since 2017, this aspect has doubled as a portion of overall BB revenue, from roughly 10&amp;#37; in '17 to over 22&amp;#37; projected in '21, reflecting BB's successful ongoing foray into innovative technologies. In this segment we see BB's partnerships with Motion\\/Baidu reflected, cutting-edge technology projects that will enable unfathomable innovations in the future. We could say autonomous vehicles, or drones or anything that will be automated- they will all need to be securitized, whether with each other or on the cloud. BB's deep partnerships with global leaders like Baidu indicate John Chen has been playing 4D Chess since 2013: intensive capital expenditures to transform a company's creative intelligence don't just happen with the snap of your fingers. Put simply, you don't just go from making pagers to making AVs overnight- it's a lengthy process that will affect your growth\\/profitability, as evidenced by Blackberry's fall from grace. But if my instincts are right, Enterprise Software and Technology Solutions will drive BB's revenue growth\\/profitability, propelling it back to $100B market cap in the not-so-distant future.](https://preview.redd.it/1h96psxuwd371.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595d7f66d80d079394875a718984ee589b593bcc)\n\n[BB earns a decent amount of revenue from Licensing\\/IP, which is quite frankly a pleasant surprise to me. Essentially this component comprises BB's monetization of its global patent portfolio and licensing operations, which do things like license the Blackberry brand\\/device software to various vendors \\(a lot of handset\\). It is somewhat impressive that it's currently 31&amp;#37; of BB's top line, but then again not too surprising. Considering the Enterprise Software\\/Technology Solutions streams are at really nascent stages of growth, it makes sense that this more \\\\\"legacy\\\\\" revenue stream is so prominent. But then again, this component jumped over 20&amp;#37; in 2020 \\(what seems to be BB's turning point\\), so it's not like I'm going to argue with more revenue either. I'd say this the Matt Stafford component of BB: a reliable and solid contributor, but not something I would be betting the bank on either. But if it produces \\(which is certainly not out of the question\\), I won't complain either \\(unless I'm from Detroit\\).](https://preview.redd.it/fx1ebhmxwd371.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06730b56ca47298cd1347a8c090542c1e90eae96)\n\n[I think we've established hardware\\/handsets are a legacy business for Blackberry. Why do I talk about it? B\\/c Wall Street does, and WSB often falls prey to their fear-mongering. DON'T PAY ATTENTION. It's like Mitch Trubisky- yeah that ish was dope in 2015-2016, but we all know it's washed now and the only reason we keep talking about is because shillers want to use it to keep diverting from the real gold.](https://preview.redd.it/j0fszgu0xd371.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b2250478ab2cb6ad49956d4b2f4f89560fc56c)\n\n[I'm not going to hammer earnings to crazy... to actually say with strong conviction that you can accurately forecast that out YoY is bullshit, and anyone from Wall St telling you they can is likely doing the same thing. Never the less, we see a clear trend: great profitability growth when Blackberry pagers led the mobile handset market, awful declines from 2012-2018 as BB closed hardware operations and invested in software\\/cybersecurity ambitions, culminating in the mixed bag we've been seeing in 2018 and beyond. Wouldn't be surprised to see this earnings churn to continue until \\~2023-2025, after all, you have to invest\\/incur losses if you want long-term profitability. I'm going to stay watching the 3 primary components of BB's revenue growth for now.](https://preview.redd.it/voaefw43xd371.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f9cc1c63d585f57e3b88e20803c7f0f3ab4d79)\n\n[I care about Cash Flow far more than net income. Yeah, it's nice to look profitable, but how much money is actually coming in to your company? We see... a slow pick-up after 2020 \\(\\*pinch me\\*\\), when BB's resurrection appears to have started. Even in its legacy days, Blackberry was seeing hella cash leave the company, which just underscores software is a more profitable business than hardware. 2021 projections indicate Cash Flow could increase at the largest YoY rate in Blackberry's history \\(albeit from it's near-zero base\\). Nevertheless, if revenue growth booms like I think it will, FCF metrics are gunna look pretty green in 2022+.](https://preview.redd.it/ja112d95xd371.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56e1feaa214463cd5b3b518e9b1c6171368f65b)\n\n# My Strongest Convictions on BB\n\nWell apes, thanks for enduring my BB nut. Now time for you to swallow:\n\n* I don't believe BB is \"just a meme.\" To the tards that made fuckloads of money on BBBY, KOSS, SNDL, and even AMC (not GME, PM me if you want to debate what I would call GME) to an extent in these \"not-exactly-the-future\" businesses with high amounts of short interest- kudos to you, here's your \ud83d\udc51, King. But the tough truth is I'm skeptical that \"squeezing\" is always going to work. For starters, you think the hedgies are really that fucking stupid? I mean, come on, Chancellor/Emperor Ken Griffin had to extend Melvin $5B in credit, lather up Vlad, and testify in front of Congress. Don't exactly think continuous losses and Congressional subpoenas are exactly what the hedgies want either... I'm sure their risk management committee have been popping Addies daily since January to make sure they aren't overfuckingextended in one bet. \\*Cough\\* \\*Bill Hwang\\* Cough\\*\n* No, I truly believe Blackberry Ltd is the 2016 version of AMD in the 2021 cybersecurity market. Back then, AMD's legacy business was flailing, and the entire chip market was dominated by Intel. They went into the changing room, made themselves up, and reorganized. Capturing 1%, then 2%, then 3% of the market share seems so little nominally, but means so much for the top line, bottom line, and the share price when you go from 0 to 1. 1 to 10 may seem like a big jump, but it's launching from the ground (a baseline of 0) that is most lucrative- and that is *exactly where Blackberry (BB) sits right now*. Capturing 2% of the global cybersecurity market would send BB flying, and we'd be soaring back to $140. If BB is actually as innovative as I think, who knows?\n* Unfortunately, if you think this is a short squeeze, I'm sorry, get out. I actually kinda like seeing closes like today (plummeting down 15%), because we shake out the weak hands and I can buy more cheap shares. No one's forcing you to buy this stock, I just like it. Facts &amp; numbers don't lie either. Short interest is 9% on roughly 500M shares outstanding, so we would likely need Jay Powell, Cathie Wood, Elon, and Chamath to hop in if there was actually to be a \"squeeze\" overnight.\n* But to contradict myself somewhat, I also think June 2021 (right now) could be one of the most preferential entry points into BB ever. Data indicates 40% of the shares are owned by institutions (similar numbers to GME), indicating 60% is retail, many of them apes. The suits may scream \"overvalued reeeee,\" and they have a point, BB stock isn't exactly cheap. As it trades at roughly 8X forward sales, BB is valued as a fast growing company, but not beyond the likes of PLTR &amp; SNOW (yes different industries, but valuations that are multiple times higher) or competitors like Palo Alto Networks or Cisco. As a graduate student attempting to be not completely rarted with my limited capital, I love the risk-reward for BB, especially considering they report earnings on June 22. I suspect these numbers will come in far stronger than the St is saying, and at least they will start to lift future guidance in a significant way (both catalysts for a 50-100% move in BB IMHO). I guess we'll see how the financials reward BB's transition, but I am truly convinced this is the AMD of cybersecurity.\n* This last part is a mixed-bag (but suspicious if we dive deeper), and I'm sure a lot of apes will downvote me and possibly completely avoid BB with this knowledge, but I want to share facts since they are evidently so hard to find. We got the usual mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, etc) who own BB (roughly 25%) and two woke funds who invest in \"innovative trends\" own the other 15%. But data does indicate nasty little Ken (Citadel) reported buying 1.3M shares of BB in Q1. BB was heavily shorted pre-GME (like 30%+), and Citadel/gey bears almost definitely bought shares to cover. The question I'm wondering was did Citadel actually buy BB b/c they were so worried about a squeeze since it is a legitimate growth stock or b/c he shares my sentiments about its turnaround? Regardless, both seem like positive catalysts for the stock, and hopefully Ken answers my question.... oh wait...\n\n[Self-explanatory.](https://preview.redd.it/w33d8rdaxd371.png?width=1886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab406b459250bc6669c79e67c65c145f9b879709)\n\nObligatiory: BB to the moon.",

But perhaps more importantly, formerly deeply out-of-favor speculative growth stocks, many of them associated with Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK funds, have begun to rebound.\n\n### SPECULATIVE TECH\n\n**SPECULATIVE TECH** **SINCE MAY 12** **ZOOM VIDEO-up 15% ROKU-up 11% SHOPIFY-up 11% SPOTIFY-up 8% TELADOC-up 6%**\n\n## The changing market narrative\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nThe market narrative is changing. The first quarter storyline was that the reopening would be very strong, bond yields would move up, and inflation may be an issue later in the year.\n\nThis was only partially correct. The reopening has been strong, but bond yields have come down, not up, as investors have come to believe 1) that inflation and supply-chain issues may indeed be \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, as the Federal Reserve has insisted, and 2) that the second and third quarter is the top in earnings and economic growth.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe value trade is unwinding, and the growth bulls are winning,\u201d Alec Young, chief investment officer at Tactical Alpha, told me. \u201cBond yields are a proxy on the growth outlook,\u201d he added, noting that bond investors see moderating inflation and a slower rate of growth (though still positive) in the second half of the year.\n\nThe result: Investors are staying in the market, but they are rotating into defensives (health care) and growth (technology). Formerly crowded trades like cyclicals and banks that are associated with the \u201cvalue trade\u201d are now retreating.\u00a0\n\nWhy would investors rotate into growth stocks if growth is slowing?\n\n\u201cValue is a more economically sensitive sector because value is weighted toward industrials, energy, materials, and small caps,\u201d Young said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cEarly in the economic cycle, coming out of a recession, there is more earnings leverage from value stocks, so they are a better investment,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that everything has been compressed,\u201d Young said.\u00a0\u201cWe went into a recession really fast, and we came out of it fast, partly due to all the stimulus. Growth stocks now offer more reliable growth and are less subject to the vagaries of the economic cycle.\u201d\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs\u2019 Ben Snider and David Kostin agreed. \u201cHistory, valuations, positioning, and economic deceleration indicate that most of the rotation \\[from growth to value\\] is behind us,\u201d they said.\n\nBecause this was a \u201ccrowded\u201d (overweight) trade, Goldman suggested that many players are likely caught offsides. \u201cMutual funds are overweight Value to a larger degree than any time in our eight-year data history,\u201d they said. \u201cHedge funds remain tilted toward Growth, but that tilt has recently fallen sharply and now ranks as the lowest in over five years.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Below is a breakdown of a recent WSJ article about 5G in the US. I added some bullets throughout the article  based on some research.  Even though I disagree with a few of the author's points, I think it's a solid article and helped me understand 5G a bit more. \n\nAt the end, I included some of my own opinions. Hopefully this helps everyone better understand what is going on right now. I have a large position in one of these companies. I have decided to keep it out of this sub, but if you check my post history I am sure you can figure it out. \n\n**The U.S. Is Back in the 5G Game**\n\n*By* Stu Woo*,* May 26, 2021 12:00 pm ET\n\nThe U.S. government has upended the **$35 billion-a-year cellular-equipment industry**, ushering in a new era of competition and giving U.S. companies a shot at re-entering a sector they vacated years ago.\n\n\u00b7 The $35 billion number they reference here only refers to the US. 2020 estimates the industry in the mid $400 billion range and most projections see this industry growing to the mid $500 billion range by 2023 and mid $700 billion range by 2027. \n\nIn the past five years, only China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co., Sweden\u2019s Ericsson and Finland\u2019s Nokia Corp. captured more than a 20% share of revenue in the wireless-equipment market, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group, a research firm. **No other competitor consistently cracked even 10%.**\n\n\u00b7 Huawei: 2020 revenue was $136.7 billion, not publicly traded so no market cap, 180,000+ employees\n\n\u00b7 Ericsson (ERIC): 2020 revenue of $25.3 billion, market cap of $44.4 billion, valuation of 1.75X, 100K employees\n\n\u00b7 Nokia (NOK): 2020 revenue of $24.96 billion, market cap of $29.8 billion, valuation of 1.19X, 92k employees\n\nNow that landscape is [changing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-loses-cellular-gear-market-share-outside-china-11615118400?mod=article_inline). Pushed by Washington\u2019s campaign to cripple Huawei over cybersecurity concerns, **countries representing more than 60% of the world\u2019s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against Huawei**, says Dell\u2019Oro Group. And to take advantage of that opening, the U.S. government\u2014as well as governments in the U.K. and European Union\u2014are considering financial support and other measures to boost domestic cellular-equipment makers trying to crack the three incumbents\u2019 stranglehold on the market.\n\nThe result is a newly competitive market that is reminiscent of the 1990s, when bygone industry giants such as Lucent, Motorola, Nortel, Siemens and Alcatel fought for a piece of a growing telecom-equipment pie.\n\n\u00b7 Lucent merged with Alcatel in 2006 to form Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia absorbed Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. \n\n\u00b7 Motorola split into Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions in 2011. Google acquired Motorola Mobility which, focuses on phones, in 2012 which was then sold to Lenovo in 2015. Motorola Solutions (MSI) 2020 revenue of $7.4 billion, market cap of $35.2 billion, valuation of 4.76X, 18K employees.\n\no MSI appears to focus on smaller, private networks especially in public safety. \n\n\u00b7 Nortel: Went bankrupt in 2009 and Ericsson purchased most of its telecommunication assets over the next few years. \n\n\u00b7 Siemens (SIEGY): 2020 revenue of $69.4 billion, market cap of $140.6 billion, valuation of 2.03X, 293k employees (manufactures switchboards and 5G routers)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a Wild West feel to it,\u201d says Bill Plummer, a former Nokia and Huawei executive now working at JMA Wireless, a Syracuse, N.Y., 5G company. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this since probably the eve of the dot-com bust\u2014this dynamic and thriving competitive environment in wireless.\u201d\n\nThat new environment could benefit everyone\u2014other than, of course, Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. It will give a host of competitors a chance to win business that only a couple of years ago seemed out of reach. And the new competitive fervor should increase innovation and lower costs for wireless carriers, which could pass on savings\u2014and the fruits of those innovations\u2014to customers.\n\nAmerican officials further say the new competitive landscape is crucial to U.S. efforts to counter China\u2019s influence in developing 5G technology, **the next generation of wireless technology that will serve as the building blocks for all sorts of future technologies\u2014whether in robot-run factories, heart-rate monitors, or any number of industries and products. The country that dominates 5G will be well-positioned to lead the technology industry in terms of profits and talent in the years ahead.**\n\n**The 3G days**\n\nAfter a vibrant start to the 3G era in the 2000s, when manufacturers throughout North America, Europe and Asia competed, equipment manufacturers started consolidating amid pressure from Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE Corp. which were both selling increasingly competitive hardware at lower prices. In 2016, Nokia\u2019s acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, itself a merger of French and American companies, created today\u2019s three-giant oligopoly.\n\nThe Trump administration began loosening the trio\u2019s grip on the market in 2018 when it started urging allies to blacklist industry leader Huawei over national-security concerns. **The campaign worked: Huawei lost market share outside China to both Ericsson and Nokia last year**, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group, as governments enacted or considered restrictions on Huawei\u2019s equipment.\n\n\u201cThe big change over the past couple of years is pressure on Huawei,\u201d says James Barford, a telecom analyst for Enders Analysis. \u201cEven in countries where there is no formal ban, you\u2019re going to be thinking twice\u201d about using equipment from the Chinese company.\n\nThe stranglehold of the big three was further weakened by Nokia\u2019s blunder in procuring expensive chips for its 5G equipment\u2014a mistake that resulted in its equipment costing more upfront, as well as consuming more power. That\u2019s an issue for wireless carriers, which can spend roughly 20% of operating expenses on energy. Nokia says it has since moved to cheaper, power-efficient chips, but damage was done: Some carriers looked elsewhere for supplies.\n\n\u00b7 This appears to still be up in the air, but Pekka Lundmark, Nokia\u2019s CEO, seemed adamant in an interview after Q1 that chips are no longer an issue for Nokia. We shall see. \n\nWith both Huawei and Nokia under pressure, that left Ericsson as the market leader outside China. But that, in turn, made wireless carriers\u2019 executives wary. They say they want more competition to increase innovation and reduce costs.\n\nThe result has been an opening for a whole new generation of competitors\u2014and the Wild West environment.\n\n**The open gambit**\n\nSome carriers are turning to Samsung Electronics Co. , the South Korean smartphone giant that is a relative newcomer to the wireless-infrastructure industry. It ranked fifth behind the three giants and China\u2019s ZTE in 2020, but won a major victory last year when Verizon Communications Inc. switched suppliers from Nokia to Samsung.\n\n\u00b7 ZTE: 2020 revenue of $15.86 billion, market cap of $21.84 billion, valuation of 1.38X, 74k employees (traded on Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges)\n\n\u00b7 Samsung: 2020 revenue of $212 billion, market cap of $500 billion, valuation of 2.36X, 109k or 284K employees (traded on Korean Stock Market)\n\nBut it\u2019s the possibility of buying 5G equipment using open-standards software that has the most potential for roiling the competitive order.\n\nTo understand why, consider that the cellular equipment that transmits signals to phones consists of three parts: the antenna, hardware that sits on a pole directly under the antenna, and more hardware at the pole\u2019s base. **Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia currently sell all three parts in a bundle, and they aren\u2019t interoperable**. For instance, a Huawei antenna doesn\u2019t work with Ericsson electronics under the antenna.\n\nIt would be like buying a Dell laptop that works with only a Dell monitor and Dell printer. And it means customers have limited options on price, quality and features.\n\nEnter a new technology based on open standards, dubbed **Open RAN**, or radio access network. Companies making equipment based on these standards **allow wireless carriers to mix and match the antennas with different under-antenna hardware and centralized electronics**. That gives carriers more options for cost and quality.\n\n\u00b7 Huawei: Does not believe in the use of Open RAN.\n\n\u00b7 Ericsson: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 Nokia: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 ZTE: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 Samsung: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\nThe U.S. government is a major backer of the open-software efforts, which officials say could boost both U.S. national security and business. It potentially can help U.S. businesses by creating openings for new players, and because these new efforts rely less on hardware (where the U.S. has fallen behind) and more on software (where companies such as [**Microsoft**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) **Corp**. and [**International Business Machines**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IBM) **Corp**. can potentially play a role).\n\n\u00b7 Microsoft: Partnership with Ericsson focuses on the auto industry. Partnership with Nokia focuses on cloud solutions for enterprise. Dealings with Huawei appear to be smartphone based, not 5G. \n\n\u00b7 IBM: Has partnered with Ericsson in the past, but appears to be working more closely with Nokia and Samsung recently. \n\n\u201cWe may be able to increase security, reduce our exposure to any single foreign vendor, lower costs and push the equipment market to where the United States is uniquely skilled\u2014in software,\u201d Federal Communications Commission Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in March.\n\nIf U.S. companies do indeed become major players in 5G equipment, then they can also play a bigger role in setting global standards for telecom equipment. That\u2019s an arena where China has made great strides. U.S. officials prefer that companies in the U.S. and allied democracies set wireless standards, which they believe would lead to greater, less hackable security.\n\nPresident Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide last month agreed that the U.S. and Japan would collaborate to advance open 5G networks \u201cby fostering innovation and by promoting trustworthy vendors and diverse markets,\u201d the White House said. Congress this year enacted a law to establish a Commerce Department fund that would award grants to support the use of such open-standards equipment in the U.S. A bipartisan group of lawmakers backing the bill requested $750 million for the fund in fiscal year 2022.\n\nIn the U.K., a government-appointed task force to help British wireless carriers transition away from Huawei equipment recommended that new equipment makers, or those using open-standards software, represent 25% of the country\u2019s wireless infrastructure by the mid-2020s. The task force recommended government incentives for wireless carriers buying such equipment, and for suppliers to locate research facilities in the U.K. The European Union this year started examining similar options.\n\n**The focus of newcomers**\n\nSeveral smaller U.S. companies\u2014such as [Airspan Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AIRO), Altiostar, Mavenir, JMA and Parallel Wireless\u2014are focused on 5G equipment using open software. Ericsson and Nokia are also shifting to using some open-standard software.\n\nThe new challengers have signed deals with some big carriers. [AT&amp;T](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) Inc. is testing open-standards equipment and plans to gradually introduce it, while newcomer wireless-carrier [Dish Network](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DISH) Corp. has said its entire network would rely on such infrastructure.\n\n\u00b7 [Airspan Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AIRO) (AIRO): 2020 revenue was $54.7 million, market cap of 11.9 million, valuation of 0.22X, 900 employees\n\n\u00b7 Altiostar: 2020 revenue was $10-50 million, not publicly traded so no market cap, 359 employees, they are pre IPO and Qualcomm is an investor\n\n\u00b7 Mavenir (MVNR): 2020 revenue was $462 million, market cap of $1.72 billion, valuation of 3.72X, 4,200employees\n\n\u00b7 JMA: 2020 revenue was $369 million, not publicly traded so no market cap, 1,000 employees\n\n\u00b7 Parallel Wireless: 2020 revenue was $75 million , not publicly traded so no market cap, 450 employees\n\n\u00b7 Dish Network Corp: Rumored to be trying to become the 4th major US network behind Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile. Partnered with Nokia on 5G software. Has worked with Ericsson in the past, but has been working closer with Mavenir and Qualcomm lately. \n\n\u00b7 AT&amp;T: Has 5 year deal with Nokia for 5G services. Also has a deal with Nokia on 5G software. Partners with Ericsson on Private 5G Networks. Appears to be trying to move away from Huawei, but still works with them outside of US. \n\nDell\u2019Oro Group predicts that equipment using open standards, from both newcomers and incumbents transitioning into the new market, **will capture 10% of the market by 2025**.\n\n\u201cThe operators say, \u2018We need choice, we need a strong ecosystem,\u2019 \u201d says Thierry Maupil\u00e9, a former Motorola and [Cisco Systems](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CSCO) Inc. executive who now works at Altiostar, which provides software for open-standards 5G equipment. **\u201cYou have a playing field that has been reduced to a few companies.\u201d**\n\nStill, **open-standards equipment remains in its early stages**, and it is too soon to know whether it will be a major player. Wireless carriers say their tests of open-standards equipment show some drawbacks. The new technology can be less energy-efficient than today\u2019s conventional systems. And while the open-standards equipment can be used in rural areas, its performance isn\u2019t yet up to snuff in densely populated urban areas.\n\n**But wireless carriers expect the open-standards equipment to be on par with Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia equipment in three or four years.**\n\n\u201cFor us, it is critical to maintain competition in our vendor system,\u201d says Michael Trabbia, chief technology officer at French carrier Orange SA. **\u201cWe cannot end up with only two players.\u201d**\n\n\u00b7 The two players are of course Nokia and Ericsson with Huawei more and more out of the picture with more than 60% of the world\u2019s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against them. Similar bans are being placed on ZTE so Nokia and Ericsson should continue to gain market share. This could also help Samsung, but I feel like their focus is elsewhere as a company. \n\n\u00b7 I\u2019ve kept things fact based up until now and will close with an opinion. Nokia and Ericsson appear to have an establishing duopoly in an industry that the US government has now twice admitted is massively important to the future technological success of all countries. \n\n\u00b7 So much so that they are looking to spend money to try to help US based competitors of Nokia and Ericsson. The new competitors this article mentions are all small and well behind what the tech giants provide. Even with US funding they are not too worrisome. Mavenir seems like the most legitimate threat, but they already have a valuation multiple higher than Nokia and Ericsson. I don\u2019t really see a fund of $750 million dollars split across 5 companies making much of a difference at the end of the day either. \n\n\u00b7 Open RAN may be the future, but that is long ways away. This article suggests that a move to Open RAN in the US will hurt Nokia and Ericsson and help the smaller guys. I do not believe that will be the case. The tech giants will stay ahead of the smaller guys the same way they have done with hardware. And even if they do not the article states that it should make up only 10% of the market by 2021.",

        "selftext": "(CSE:DIGI), (OTC: DBKSF)\n\nWith Digicyrypts recently officially rebranding itself to DigiMax recently I thought it would be a great time to share some DD and overall a brief summary of what these guys are doing and why I like them so much. So without further ado...\n\nDigimax is a Canadian company that focuses on AI and predictive tech. They have got a great team behind them and have several different services that they offer using this advanced technology. These services stretch into several sectors like financial, HR, crypto, and logistics, and all use a similar, constantly improving AI engine. Personally, I'll never get over just how cool AI as a concept is, what once seemed to be the stuff of sci-fi films is now very much so a reality. This engine is extremely effective at completing different types of analysis and predicting trends without the need for human influence or intervention.\n\nTheir first service I want to highlight is DataNavee. This is an engine for commercial business use and helps analyze trends in several factors associated with running a large or small business. These factors and indicators include sales, revenues, and supply chain quantities, all figures that are key to running a smooth business. DataNavee takes companies existing figures and extrapolates and interprets them allowing business owners to choose the best course of action based on the AI's highly advanced projections.\n\nFor anyone who is a big fan of crypto investments, they have their Crypto tracking and predicting service known as CryptoHawk. Once again using an advanced AI, it is able to track the prices and trends of Bitcoin and Etherium and make projections about future fluctuations. This service, in particular, is getting a huge improvement in the near future as Digimax brought on Delphi Anlaytics' crypto division to improve the accuracy of analysis and add other cryptocurrencies. This service generates SAAS revenue and has seen some impressive demand. In the same vein as crypto, they also look to open their own crypto fund which will be supported by their acquisitions of Kirobo and Barberton Fund this year.\n\nI am super impressed with the different revenue streams DigiMax and I still haven't even mentioned Darwin Ecosystem, a system that uses a projected personality interpreter to make hiring decisions. This particular project was made with IBM Watson and is currently used by 17 law enforcement agencies.\n\nWith the upcoming summer launch of their Crypto fund along with advancements in their other projects, DigiMax is looking to take the tech world by storm and offer industry-topping services. While this may be a big vision for a company with a $0.17 stock price, I definitely think it's within the realm of what's possible and for that reason, they are on my list!\n\nDisclaimer: DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, this ain't investment advice!",

        "selftext": "mCloud Technologies (Ticker: MCLDF) is a 10 bagger in the making. mCloud has identified a niche opportunity to optimize energy assets for all businesses to contribute to higher ESG scores and overall energy savings. Bank of America (TICKER: BAC) **HAS ALL 3,300 of their branches connected to their software and SAVED roughly $40,000,000 through improved efficiencies (5). The savings they generated EXCEEDED the amount paid for the subscription.** \n\nQuick facts:\n\n*  WILL BE CASH FLOW POSITIVE by mid Q3 2021.\n* Quick Ratio well over 1\n* Price-to-Sales below 2\n* Gross Margins of 61%\n* SaaS company with 273% Net Dollar Retention and ZERO attrition currently serving an untapped market (Unbelievable)\n* Currently have 60,000 subscribers (Connect assets) which include blue-chip customers like McDonalds (Ticker: MCD), Planet Fitness (Ticker: PLNT), Starbucks (Ticker: SBUX), Telus (Ticker: T.TO) , Longyuen (Largest wind farm in China), etc (AND GROWING).\n* Comparables: Aspen Technologies (Ticker: AZPN), Honeywell (Ticker: HON), C3AI (Ticker: AI).\n* Stock price is down because COVID-19 restricted them from going to clients and connecting them. HUGE tailwinds as resections lift. \n* Five days ago (May 27th, 2021) Jack Vander Aarde from Maxim Group reiterated a \"BUY\" rating with a **price target of $5 (242% upside).** His recommendations have generated a 110% return while being a tracked analyst on TD Ameritrade with a success rate of 74%, ranking 13th out of 7,533 tracked analysts... No fluff here just facts.\n\nThe first component of the *AssetCareTM* foundation (Their SaaS product) is the IoT sensors that are attached to client\u2019s assets (HVAC Systems, Wind Turbines, Electrical Transformers, Nuclear Power Plants, Heat Exchangers, etc.). The same way IoT sensors in an Apple Watch track the distance and speed you've ran or your sleeping patterns and heartbeat, mCloud's IoT sensors track real time asset data in buildings, oil and gas facilities, and wind farms. Some examples of the data points tracked are Kilowatt/hour usage (HVAC), outdoor temperature (HVAC), heating and cooling effectiveness (HVAC), system run-times (HVAC), heat transfer and viscosity (Oil and Gas), control systems (Oil and Gas), blade speed (Wind), etc. All of the respective information is collected, combined, and stored in the cloud where analytics are applied and correlations are made to directly decrease operating costs and provide better insight on the assets overall health (As oppose to traditional \"straight-line\" deprecation methods). These sensors years ago were very expensive and could not feasibly be used in providing a price-conscience product to consumers. With new advances in technology, the price of these sensors have dropped dramatically and the accuracy of the data they can accumulate has improved significantly. \n\nThe next foundational piece to their product is the cloud. In the 20th century companies had hardware that took up the size of entire rooms to store a fraction of data/information that can be stored today in a victual cloud. Now in the 21st century, big cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and IBM viciously compete for customers, driving the price of storage down exponentially. With mCloud sensors tracking data 24/7/365, they now have a place to store and analyze it cheaply for its current 60,000 connected assets (and growing). The amount of storage needed for this *AssetCareTM* product was non-existent years ago and not available at a viable cost.\n\nLastly, with the cloud able to store all the data generated 24/7/365, data and analytics can now viably be applied to the entire data set. Traditionally in the late 20th century and early 21st century, organizations were only able to take a sample of the data available and come up with limited conclusions. Now with a place to store all data, companies like mCloud can provide an extremely more accurate analysis on the performance and health of any asset by identifying immensely more accurate anomalies and trends.\n\n**Summary**\n\nmCloud is unlocking the untapped potential of energy intensive assets with AI and analytics, curbing energy waste, maximizing energy production, and getting the most out of critical energy infrastructure. Through mCloud's AI-powered AssetCare\u2122 platform, mCloud offers complete asset management solutions for commercial buildings, renewable energy, healthcare, heavy industry, and connected workers. IoT sensors bring data from connected assets into the cloud, where AI and analytics are applied to maximize their performance.",

The suit comes as GlobalFoundries works with banks on an initial public offering that could value the chipmaker at about $30 billion.\n\n\u201cThis action arises out of what seems to be a misguided and ill-conceived effort by IBM\u2019s law department to try to extract an outlandish payment,\u201d GlobalFoundries said its complaint.\n\nIBM agreed in 2014 to pay GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion for GlobalFoundries to acquire the unit. As part of the deal, GlobalFoundries became IBM\u2019s exclusive provider of certain power processors for the next 10 years, in exchange for access to IBM\u2019s intellectual property. GlobalFoundries acquired manufacturing facilities in East Fishkill, New York, and Essex Junction, Vermont.\n\nGlobalFoundries is backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Co. The chipmaker is coming to market as numerous industries complain they can\u2019t get enough semiconductor supply and governments across the globe gear up to provide financial support for expansions in production.\n\nA call and email to IBM wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\n\n\u2018Highly Suspect\u2019\n\nIn its lawsuit, GlobalFoundries said IBM\u2019s request for damages is \u201chighly suspect\u201d as it follows news of the potential IPO. GlobalFoundries also said that IBM \u201chas yet to provide any substantive explanation\u201d to its claims over the alleged breach.\n\nGlobalFoundries said in its lawsuit that it invested billions of dollars to develop cutting-edge chip-making technology, but that it decided not to pursue IBM\u2019s \u201cfailing strategy\u201d and notified IBM in 2018.\n\nAccording to the filing, development of the chip-technology was more challenging and expensive than initially anticipated, causing delays in the project\u2019s targeted milestones. GlobalFoundries says it spent more money to catch up but still fell behind competitors including Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. It also alleges IBM was \u201cwell aware\u201d of delays and the switch to Samsung was beneficial for the company as it was cheaper and faster than GlobalFoundries would have been able deliver.\n\nIBM didn\u2019t complain about GlobalFoundries\u2019 actions until news of its potential IPO broke, and it now seeks \u201ca quick payday,\u201d GlobalFoundries alleges.\n\nThe case is GlobalFoundries v. IBM, New York Supreme Court, New York County.\n\n(Updates with details of complaint)\n\nMore stories like this are available on [bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/)\n\n[Subscribe now](https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/67obqkd5zdp5lj8/?utm_source=yahoo_usn) to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

Yes, Blackberry is one of those stock. In my view it's massively undervalued Cyber Security and IoT company. Their Blackberry Spark platform is taking over everything and overtaking Crowdstrike business too. How i make this assessment? Simple, if Crowdstrike was a good technology compnay the entire US federal government would be using it....BUT there're NOT! they are going to Blackberry.  **Blackberry has integrated artificial intelligence into all their products now.** \n\nEven IBM has decided to ditch their own cyber security software and switched to selling Blackberry Spark suite in Canada. When one of your biggest competitor ditches their own product and starts selling your product, that's a sign that you have an amazing crazy magic like product. \n\n[here's the proof](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-and-ibm-canada-establish-a-new-partnership)\n\nCompared to industry the blackberry spark artificial intelligence machine is years in advance. **No other** ai based cyber security comes close to blackberry engine, this is why US government and 77% of fortune 100 companies have switched to blackberry. i will list their growing customers(big enterprises) in next part. **BB holds the biggest ai patent portfolio in cyber security!!**\n\nRevenue growth will explode in coming months and quarters. The ai based spark platform was launched last year and it took them few months to get their ducks and marketing in row! \n\nNext article i will dive deep into their latest product called Blackberry Persona! it's a god like ai that stops insider threats and stolen password(the pipeline hack could have been prevented if they had used blackberry). Password will be history and no longer will be required as we move into the future. \n\n**if we compare valuation to peers, the company should be around 70 Billion minimum or about $140 per share.** \n\nNot a financial advice.

        "selftext": "As a sequel to \"10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM\", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.\n\nStarting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),\n\n1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . \"Growth at a Reasonable Price\" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or \"TTM\" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!\n\nMoving on to Factor ETFs,\n\n2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.\n\n3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.\n\n4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.  \n\n5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.\n\n6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles \"quality\" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for \"profitability\", \"solvency and financial risk\", and \"earnings quality\".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.\n\nLet us not forget commodities,\n\n7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and \"flat\" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.\n\n8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.\n\nSeeking dividends?\n\n9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.\n\nFinally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,\n\n10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.\n\nDisclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?",

        "selftext": "Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.\n\nLong before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention \u2014 first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.\n\nAnd that's where we see a major opportunity.\n\nBlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle \"the Enterprise of Things.\" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.\n\nIf your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.\n\nSecond Bloom!\n\nIt's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 \u2014 and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.\n\nBut this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.\n\nBlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.\n\nBut the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.\n\nThe company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. \n\nStill Green!\n\nThat hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.\n\nSince being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).\n\nAdd it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.\n\nRisks and When We'd Sell!\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&amp;D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors \u2014 companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others \u2014 have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line!\n\nNot every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is \"largely done reinventing itself\" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know \u2014 he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected \"things\" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past. That's a sweet opportunity.",

        "selftext": "C3.ai(NYSE:AI)\n\nSector: Technology\n\nIndustry: Information Technology Services\n\nMarket cap: [6B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AI?p=AI)\n\nC3.ai, Inc is an enterprise artificial intelligence company. The company provides software-as-a-service applications that enable customers to rapidly develop, deploy, and operate large-scale Enterprise AI applications across any infrastructure. It provides solutions under three divisions namely:\n\n* The C3 AI Suite: proprietary model-driven architecture, addresses the requirements for the digital transformation software stack, providing a low-code/no-code AI and Internet of Things, or IoT, platform that accelerates software development, reduces cost and risk, and delivers applications that are flexible enough to meet evolving needs.\n* C3 AI Applications: a large and growing family of industry-specific and application-specific turnkey AI solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed such as:\n   * Inventory Optimization: a solution to optimize raw material, in-process, and finished goods inventory levels\n   * Supply Network Risk: provides visibility into risks of disruption throughout the supply chain operations for enterprise supply chain managers\n   * Customer Churn Management: enables account executives and relationship managers to monitor customer satisfaction using transactional, behavioral, and contextual information, as well as to take action to prevent customer churn with AI-based and human-interpretable predictions and warning\n   * Production Schedule Optimization: a solution for scheduling production \n   * Predictive Maintenance: provides insight into asset risk to maintenance planners and equipment operators\n   * Fraud Detection solution\n   * Energy Management solution \n* C3.ai Ex Machina: analytics for applying data science to every-day business decisions\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zudwz718ew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12d05673719c96e4bce13e8389d0f2c8a63f3006)\n\nC3 is growing rapidly with a total revenue of $156.7M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $91.6M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 representing a year-over-year growth of 71%. Over the same period, the subscription revenue grew to $135.4M from $77.5M representing a 75% increase.\n\nC3 has high total contract values for software subscriptions. The average total subscription contract values were:\n\n* 2016: $1.2M\n* 2017: $11.7M\n* 2018: $10.8M\n* 2019: $16.2M\n* 2020: $12.1M\n\n**BULL ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 has a first-mover advantage in Enterprise AI due to investment into their products and technology over the last decade. They have \u201cLighthouse Customers\u201d, or large global early adopters, in Europe, Asia, and the United States across a range of industries that serve as proof points for other potential customers. Some customers include:\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6v6m5kedew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e44125b37976abacc041856b3b4fda5e7608a95)\n\nThere is an extensive partner ecosystem that includes strategic relationships with established technology leaders like:\n\n* [Amazon Web Services](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005314/en/C3-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Expand-Collaboration-to-Drive-Enterprise-Artificial-Intelligence-Adoption)\n* Fidelity National Information Services\n* [Google](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180821005202/en/C3-IoT-and-Google-Cloud-Announce-Partnership)\n* [IBM](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-27/correcting-and-replacing-ibm-services-and-c3-ai-announce-strategic-alliance-for-digital-transformation-with-ai)\n* [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/microsoft-sees-gain-on-c3ai-investment-concurrent-with-ipo.html)\n\nAlthough the average total subscription value is decreasing and may continue to decrease, C3 has restructured the sales organization and expanded the market-partner ecosystem to address small, medium, and large sales opportunities. The progress is promising as the average total subscription contract value for six months ended October 31, 2020 was $7.7M.\n\nOn February 1, 2021, the [launch of the Open AI Energy Initiative](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-c3-ai-baker-hughes-220000073.html) was announced by Shell, C3, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft. The initiative provides a framework for energy operators, service providers, equipment providers, and independent software vendors for energy services to offer interoperable solutions powered by the [BHC3 AI Suite](https://bakerhughesc3.ai/bhc3-ai-suite/model-driven-architecture/) and Microsoft Azure.\n\n**BEAR ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 faces intense competition and which could be an \u201cearly bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese\u201d type of situation as second movers could develop technology to improve upon any shortfalls. The main sources of potential competition include:\n\n* Greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases\n* Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing across a broader portfolio\n* Wider geographic presence\n* Lower labor and research and development costs\n* Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios\n* Greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, hire talent, and to develop and introduce new products\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel has received many [honors and awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181112005818/en/EY-Honors-Thomas-M.-Siebel-as-2018-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year%C2%AE), but if he, or other senior management team members, were to leave the company C3 may not be able to execute their business strategy. Siebel is critical to the overall management and continued development of the AI suite and AI Applications. All of the executive officers are at-will employees and they do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\n\nC3 has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. The sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense. This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organization structure, and approval requirements. A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3\u2019s revenue. The top three entities together accounted for 34% and 44% of the revenue for years ended April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3.3 years.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nGiven the success of C3\u2019s customers, I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base. They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements. Additionally, C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses. I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams. The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to $271B in 2024, a 12% CAGR from 2020's estimate of $174B.  This is a big opportunity for C3.  The lock up period [ended on June 7, 2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=907559-94759), and earnings happened on June 2, 2021. I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point. I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade, but more so a long-term investment. \n\n*I am not a financial advisor.

Citadel securities has taken short position in WKHS. They are short 2,099,000 shares in Puts, have 1,822,200 shares tied into Calls, and own 779,284 shares. ([https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese filings don't include if they sold the calls/puts, or bought the calls/puts. But I have reason to believe, given that they have 2,099,000 shares short (which stands for about 21,000 Puts contracts; 100 share multiplier per contract) and are in the 6/18 Strike Price of 6 Put and the 9 Put as well. Just look at the open interest from thinkorswim below (Boxed in orange, right side). And obviously you might think, just coincidental. But..... I have coded the change of open interest to determine when this position was made, and if it was made all at once. To the right of the picture below, you can see that this position was placed between 15-20 trading days prior (OI (-15/-20Days). AKA 3-4 weeks prior, which puts us at the week prior to their fillings, May 17th. Like I said, these fillings were reported on May 21st.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow what about the call? They are tied into 1,822,200 shares or about (18k call contracts). Now again, looking at the coded option chain data, you can see that once again there was a position placed again for the 20 Call of this weeks, 6/18 expiration. The open interest increased to 18,513 15 days ago, or again, right at the time of Citadels fillings on May 21st.\n\nAs per u/JulianFranklin \"They sold 18,000 call contracts with a $20 strike price. That means they are promising to SELL 1.8 million shares (18,000 contracts X 100 shares per contract) at $20 each. That means, if WKHS finishes Friday at less than $20 they don't have to do anything, all the money they made selling the options is pure profit. Remember, options don't exist until someone sells them. An option is just a promise to either buy or sell at a later date under certain conditions. If the conditions aren't met by the timeline in the promise, then the option vanishes and the person who sold it wins. Now to the REAL part of your question...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCitadel wins if WKHS finishes above $9 and below $20. For every dollar ABOVE $20 that WKHS gets to by Friday closing bell, Citadel will lose $1.8 million (less whatever they were paid when they sold the option). So if WKHS goes to $25.55 at closing bell, Citadel loses $10 million. If it goes to $31.11 they lose $20 million. If WKHS goes to $50, they lose $54 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA protective collar strategy is performed by purchasing an out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously writing an out-of-the-money call option. The underlying asset and the expiration date must be the same. This strategy is often used by investors after a long position in a stock has experienced substantial gains. This allows investors to have downside protection as the long put helps lock in the potential sale price. However, the trade-off is that they may be obligated to sell shares at a higher price, thereby forgoing the possibility for further profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of this strategy is if an investor is long on 100 shares of IBM at $50 and suppose that IBM rises to $100 as of January 1. The investor could construct a protective collar by selling one IBM March 105 call and simultaneously buying one IBM March 95 put. The trader is protected below $95 until the expiration date. The trade-off is that they may potentially be obligated to sell their shares at $105 if IBM trades at that rate prior to expiry.\n\nThe main drawback of this strategy is that the investor is giving away upside in the stock in exchange for obtaining downside protection. The protective collar works like a charm if the stock declines, but not so well if the stock surges ahead and is \"called away,\" as any additional gain above the call strike price will be lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore details can be found here [https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/nyxnrj/fellow\\_ape\\_brothers\\_and\\_sisters\\_of\\_wkhs\\_we\\_must/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf&amp;utm\\_term=link](https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/nyxnrj/fellow_ape_brothers_and_sisters_of_wkhs_we_must/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_term=link)",

        "selftext": "Why I think BB is legit\n\nHonest View on BB\n\nApe Research Analyst Report on BB: To the Moon\n\nWhat's up apes, I know the last couple weeks have been life-changing for some of us. As a grad student who grew up on the lower end of the middle class, I recognize how pumped some fo you must feel and commend everyone's brass balls- it's never easy to make money in a casino as heavily manipulated as the free market that is the USA. But turning to BB: it was never meant to be just some squeeze (although its end result could technically be called that if you really wanted too)- it's a retooling company embedded in a crucial sector to the modern global economy.\n\nAnd so while some of us have become capable of retirement in recent weeks, I want to talk about a name that is on the cusp of a resurrection.\n\n# For BB Holders, it's been tough lately.\n\nMany people have harsh memories of Blackberry: it was on the cusp of bankruptcy as recently as 2015. Revenue growth sunk from $20B at its peak in 2011 (82% hardware sales) to under a $1B in the 2010s; $BB stock sunk from a peak of $146 in 2008 to single digits, thanks to negative cash flows and rapidly declining top line growth.\n\n[Not surprising BB ate shit for so long- this useless Etch-a-Sketch was 82&amp;#37; of their revenue in 2011!](https://preview.redd.it/w7dt7c4bwd371.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80e0a1b70f7bad3078d8bb3d3982d69b1d12f1bb)\n\n[It's been a long, tough run for Blackberry shareholders since they ended hardware production\\/sales. The stock has been largely irrelevant for years, falling from a peak of $146 in May 2008 to single digits \\&lt; $5B market cap. But its transition into a cybersecurity company is only beginning to pay fruit, which I believe the market will catch on to very soon. Times are a-changing!](https://preview.redd.it/f5zqz58dwd371.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763644f3ae3cc922a25d1e06d7d0a295ae5d5ed9)\n\n# A Rebranded Business for the Digital Economy\n\nLike we've seen with the Chads in Gamestoink, successful companies are the ones willing to renounce their fading legacy businesses and embrace initiatives and industries that sit on the cusp of the digital age. Enter Blackberry. Now we all remember Blackberry's legacy business- the handheld pagers that looked like shit, but only quirky people embraced (POTUS and CEOs used Blackberry pagers over iPhones for the longest of times, until Blackberry discontinued its hardware line).\n\nHowever, the primary focus for Blackberry has never changed. Blackberry was always security-centric, and with the installation of CEO John S. Chen in 2013, Blackberry pivoted towards software- a trend that was always going to happen given Apple's prowess in manufacturing superior smartphones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[John S. Chen's my homie. If you're scared about holding BB bags, just reassure yourself that that chin can hold both yours and his. But seriously, he's an innovator, having been credited with \\\\\"Saving Blackberry\\\\\"- pay attention, his vision doesn't end with subsistence.](https://preview.redd.it/l39tl9rfwd371.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ee66024cfba9e04ea1566f5690aeb57ecd2497)\n\nBut like Ryan Cohen with Gamestop/Chewy, Blackberry recognized it needed to adapt to survive, and that's exactly what it has done under Chen's stewardship. A glimpse at Blackberry today is far different than the pioneer that once controlled 20%+ of the mobile hardware market.\n\n[Revenues have intuitively followed a similar trajectory as Blackberry's market cap. But the transformation under Chen's leadership so far is tangible: after hardware sales alone accounted for 82&amp;#37; of revenue in 2011, the company made a wide U-turn. After establishing \\(and meeting\\) a goal for fiscal 2020 revenue to top $1B again, hardware has fallen to just \\~3&amp;#37; of sales. Enterprise software \\(44&amp;#37;\\), Licensing &amp; IP \\(31&amp;#37;\\), and Technology Solutions \\(22&amp;#37;\\) now dominate BB's topline as of 2020, cementing its push and admittance to the cybersecurity market.](https://preview.redd.it/u9mg373iwd371.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8790440834c2d2f933eb88018fa6971d95ce0e)\n\n# So what does Blackberry actually do now?\n\nTo be clear, the only people walking around with Blackberry \"phones\" nowadays are old junkies trying to revive some 2000s nostalgia. Blackberry doesn't make that archaic crap anymore. All you need to remember are three phrases when thinking about the new Blackberry: **enterprise software, licensing IP,** and **technology solutions**.\n\n* **Enterprise software** is one of the fastest growing components of BB's cybersecurity offering. It includes products like the Blackberry Enterprise Mobility Suite, which provides endpoint management and BlackBerry AtHoc, a secure communications platform.\n* **Licensing IP** is the segment responsible for the monetization of the Company\u2019s global patent portfolio as well as the mobility licensing operations, which license the BlackBerry brand and device software to handset vendors.\n* **Technology Solutions** is the business that includes BlackBerry QNX embedded software as well as several emerging businesses such as the BlackBerry Radar fleet management solutions.\n\nExciting Partnerships, Soaring Ambitions\n\n*\\*\\*You should really take a look at some of Blackberry's partnerships in the last 2 years- this is not a company that makes shitty pagers anymore, it's the company that embodies \"digital transformation.\"*\n\nTake a look at some of the companies Blackberry is sleeping with and tell me your smooth gorilla brain doesn't swell:\n\n* **Baidu** has an extensive partnership with BB in its autonomous vehicle unit, dating back to 2018. In January 2018, the two companies announced they would [partner](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) to utilize Blackberry QNX's OS as the backbone of Baidu's autonomous system. Blackberry also agreed to help Baidu integrate smartphone integration software for Chinese connected cars (CarLife), conversational AI (DuerOS), and HD maps. In January 2021, these two [expanded](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) their relationship: Blackberry's QNX Neutrino Real-Time OS is being utilized for all future EV models produced with the EV branch of GAC (Guangzhou Automotive Group, yes the C isn't a typo). Pretty exciting stuff to say the least..\n* **Motional**, which is a Hyundai backed AV startup, [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform) in February 2021 its intentions to use BB's Black Channel communications technology for all of Motional's future AVs. A very integral input for Motional and impressive win for Blackberry, being able to ensure safe data communication exchanges within vehicle safety systems is essential for AVs' successful integration in society... otherwise where is the trust in accepting that ride? Not to mention that Apple (*the Tim Apple*) was chirping around with Hyundai and Kia, talking about making a \"smart car,\" *earlier this year!* I guess all the ape memes about Blackberry being a legitimate competitor to Apple shouldn't be sneezed at by Wall St equity research analysts and BB \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs...\n* **AWS**, yes Amazon Web Services (!), is another credible player lining up with Blackberry. Although not quite as exciting as building actual AVs, the work they do is still essential to ensure this dream can actually be realized. In December 2020, the two Chads [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) a multi-year partnership to develop BB's IVY platform (Intelligent Vehicle Data, yes the \"Y\" is weird, but makes sense for ape leadership), allowing automakers to read sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from the data both in the vehicle and in the cloud.\n\nTake it from Amazon's new CEO, Andy Jassy himself: *\u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences. Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d*\n\n[These geniuses love Blackberry, starting with their most intelligent, scalable business: AWS! Shouldn't you apes like BB as well?](https://preview.redd.it/ktha1d7nwd371.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b2415869531f1cf47f9c54b6d6e668c252877)\n\nBut why should I stop there? I'm tired of seeing fear-mongering Wall Street hedge funds, investment bankers, and research analysts attempting to push their positions (BB's primary competitors are IBM, Microsoft, VMware, and Mobile Iron, the former 3 of which are all significantly owned by \"institutions\" - &gt;75%) and allege Blackberry is a dying business that makes crappy hardware.\n\n* **Microsoft** (Yes its rival!) even realizes its budding competitor is crafting innovative solutions, announcing a partnership in [October 2020](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management) for Microsoft Teams! Microsoft plans to integrate Blackberry AtHoc, which will allow organizations on Teams to contact, alert, and account for all members of their group directly through Teams should some calamity transpire. Especially as we witness more cyber attacks (the digital economy's biggest threat will stem from this), it will be an all hands-on-deck effort to safeguard the integrity of our software. BB's partnership with Microsoft (and [ServiceNow](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-and-servicenow-partner-to-deliver-secure-and-re) for incident response management) not only grounds its strong advance to cybersecurity industry disruption, but its diverse agility to penetrate various sectors, ranging from AV/EV, CRM software, IoT, 5G, and so much more.\n* If the corporate pedigree isn't enough for you, I'll end with the **U.S. Air Force**. No, unlike what bulge bracket banks may lead you to believe, BB's revenue stream is well-diversified, as the USAF [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity) a partnership in September 2020. Blackberry Spark, utilized for UEM and UES, will help the Air Force with their secure productivity needs, enabling virtual work environments whilst ensuring premium security. As we face more threats in the cyber space and continue pivoting towards a \"work-from-home environment\" regardless of the permanent trends form Covid, BB's wide-ranging partnerships, from Fortune 500 tech companies to the U.S. military prove it is an essential cog in the 21st century digital economy. Not to mention consistent ARR is exactly what investors (the suits) should be looking for, so what gives with the nasty financial press?\n\n# Blackberry's Financial Trajectory (Revs, Bottom Line, CF)\n\nWe have to take a look at Blackberry's financials, after all that is what this casino allegedly runs on. Luckily, if we ignore what the \"experts\" in Battery Park are shilling, we'll notice Blackberry is not the capsizing Titanic all the research analysts make it out to be. I'll take you into a deeper dive into the top &amp; bottom line with just the facts and my brilliant takes, and y'all can make your own decision on whether BB stock is seriously a pile of rat shit or an emerging growth stud.\n\n[As you might expect, Blackberry's overall top line consistently declined until roughly 2020+ \\(when every single one of these dope partnerships was announced\\). As BB wound down its legacy hardware, handset, and related service products, sales declined nearly $400M over the course of final two years, a marked decline from the near $20B struck in 2011. This trend seems to be on the reverse though: the new partnerships in 2020\\/21 have certainly underscored BB's transition into a software company, a trend even Wall St has had to acknowledge by lifting growth targets for fiscal year 2021. IMO, the $1.2B projected top line figure for '21 is conservative, and I think these figures could start to double, triple, and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in 2024+. Let me explain why with more charts:](https://preview.redd.it/3pq5gyspwd371.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a643492be05c1ec2f4830bd0b66b180276b6b3)\n\n[All those dope corporate and military partnerships I highlighted earlier? They mainly fit into BB's Enterprise software\\/services revenue stream, which is now 44&amp;#37; of overall revenue. This is the first component that I believe is going to drive revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and tendies for us and BB in the years to come. We'll first notice that growth in this space really picked up in 2020 for BB, similarly to when their overall topline reversed trend- because this is the soul of 2021 Blackberry! And no, this doesn't even really include the innovative AV\\/EV partnerships, these are just institutional clients like Microsoft, ServiceNow, or Salesforce who want to buy one of Blackberry's SaaS established offerings. Think of the potential addressable market in the years to come: work from home, AI, 5G, IoT, we can keep going- all of these things need to be protected, without security, there is no system- every software, hardware, and appliance company under the sun is going to be lining up because they have no choice. You are adapt or go extinct. I expect BB to continue driving this aspect of its growth in a gargantuan way: think 25-50&amp;#37; growth YoY.](https://preview.redd.it/m106ixxswd371.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e12724037bc3b9f099ab2859bea4b6608f00ee)\n\n[If Enterprise Software is to be Blackberry's Patrick Mahomes, Technology Solutions will be Blackberry's Tom Brady. Since 2017, this aspect has doubled as a portion of overall BB revenue, from roughly 10&amp;#37; in '17 to over 22&amp;#37; projected in '21, reflecting BB's successful ongoing foray into innovative technologies. In this segment we see BB's partnerships with Motion\\/Baidu reflected, cutting-edge technology projects that will enable unfathomable innovations in the future. We could say autonomous vehicles, or drones or anything that will be automated- they will all need to be securitized, whether with each other or on the cloud. BB's deep partnerships with global leaders like Baidu indicate John Chen has been playing 4D Chess since 2013: intensive capital expenditures to transform a company's creative intelligence don't just happen with the snap of your fingers. Put simply, you don't just go from making pagers to making AVs overnight- it's a lengthy process that will affect your growth\\/profitability, as evidenced by Blackberry's fall from grace. But if my instincts are right, Enterprise Software and Technology Solutions will drive BB's revenue growth\\/profitability, propelling it back to $100B market cap in the not-so-distant future.](https://preview.redd.it/1h96psxuwd371.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595d7f66d80d079394875a718984ee589b593bcc)\n\n[BB earns a decent amount of revenue from Licensing\\/IP, which is quite frankly a pleasant surprise to me. Essentially this component comprises BB's monetization of its global patent portfolio and licensing operations, which do things like license the Blackberry brand\\/device software to various vendors \\(a lot of handset\\). It is somewhat impressive that it's currently 31&amp;#37; of BB's top line, but then again not too surprising. Considering the Enterprise Software\\/Technology Solutions streams are at really nascent stages of growth, it makes sense that this more \\\\\"legacy\\\\\" revenue stream is so prominent. But then again, this component jumped over 20&amp;#37; in 2020 \\(what seems to be BB's turning point\\), so it's not like I'm going to argue with more revenue either. I'd say this the Matt Stafford component of BB: a reliable and solid contributor, but not something I would be betting the bank on either. But if it produces \\(which is certainly not out of the question\\), I won't complain either \\(unless I'm from Detroit\\).](https://preview.redd.it/fx1ebhmxwd371.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06730b56ca47298cd1347a8c090542c1e90eae96)\n\n[I think we've established hardware\\/handsets are a legacy business for Blackberry. Why do I talk about it? B\\/c Wall Street does, and WSB often falls prey to their fear-mongering. DON'T PAY ATTENTION. It's like Mitch Trubisky- yeah that ish was dope in 2015-2016, but we all know it's washed now and the only reason we keep talking about is because shillers want to use it to keep diverting from the real gold.](https://preview.redd.it/j0fszgu0xd371.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b2250478ab2cb6ad49956d4b2f4f89560fc56c)\n\n[I'm not going to hammer earnings to crazy... to actually say with strong conviction that you can accurately forecast that out YoY is bullshit, and anyone from Wall St telling you they can is likely doing the same thing. Never the less, we see a clear trend: great profitability growth when Blackberry pagers led the mobile handset market, awful declines from 2012-2018 as BB closed hardware operations and invested in software\\/cybersecurity ambitions, culminating in the mixed bag we've been seeing in 2018 and beyond. Wouldn't be surprised to see this earnings churn to continue until \\~2023-2025, after all, you have to invest\\/incur losses if you want long-term profitability. I'm going to stay watching the 3 primary components of BB's revenue growth for now.](https://preview.redd.it/voaefw43xd371.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f9cc1c63d585f57e3b88e20803c7f0f3ab4d79)\n\n[I care about Cash Flow far more than net income. Yeah, it's nice to look profitable, but how much money is actually coming in to your company? We see... a slow pick-up after 2020 \\(\\*pinch me\\*\\), when BB's resurrection appears to have started. Even in its legacy days, Blackberry was seeing hella cash leave the company, which just underscores software is a more profitable business than hardware. 2021 projections indicate Cash Flow could increase at the largest YoY rate in Blackberry's history \\(albeit from it's near-zero base\\). Nevertheless, if revenue growth booms like I think it will, FCF metrics are gunna look pretty green in 2022+.](https://preview.redd.it/ja112d95xd371.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56e1feaa214463cd5b3b518e9b1c6171368f65b)\n\n# My Strongest Convictions on BB\n\nWell apes, thanks for enduring my BB nut. Now time for you to swallow:\n\n* I don't believe BB is \"just a meme.\" To the tards that made fuckloads of money on BBBY, KOSS, SNDL, and even AMC (not GME, PM me if you want to debate what I would call GME) to an extent in these \"not-exactly-the-future\" businesses with high amounts of short interest- kudos to you, here's your \ud83d\udc51, King. But the tough truth is I'm skeptical that \"squeezing\" is always going to work. For starters, you think the hedgies are really that fucking stupid? I mean, come on, Chancellor/Emperor Ken Griffin had to extend Melvin $5B in credit, lather up Vlad, and testify in front of Congress. Don't exactly think continuous losses and Congressional subpoenas are exactly what the hedgies want either... I'm sure their risk management committee have been popping Addies daily since January to make sure they aren't overfuckingextended in one bet. \\*Cough\\* \\*Bill Hwang\\* Cough\\*\n* No, I truly believe Blackberry Ltd is the 2016 version of AMD in the 2021 cybersecurity market. Back then, AMD's legacy business was flailing, and the entire chip market was dominated by Intel. They went into the changing room, made themselves up, and reorganized. Capturing 1%, then 2%, then 3% of the market share seems so little nominally, but means so much for the top line, bottom line, and the share price when you go from 0 to 1. 1 to 10 may seem like a big jump, but it's launching from the ground (a baseline of 0) that is most lucrative- and that is *exactly where Blackberry (BB) sits right now*. Capturing 2% of the global cybersecurity market would send BB flying, and we'd be soaring back to $140. If BB is actually as innovative as I think, who knows?\n* Unfortunately, if you think this is a short squeeze, I'm sorry, get out. I actually kinda like seeing closes like today (plummeting down 15%), because we shake out the weak hands and I can buy more cheap shares. No one's forcing you to buy this stock, I just like it. Facts &amp; numbers don't lie either. Short interest is 9% on roughly 500M shares outstanding, so we would likely need Jay Powell, Cathie Wood, Elon, and Chamath to hop in if there was actually to be a \"squeeze\" overnight.\n* But to contradict myself somewhat, I also think June 2021 (right now) could be one of the most preferential entry points into BB ever. Data indicates 40% of the shares are owned by institutions (similar numbers to GME), indicating 60% is retail, many of them apes. The suits may scream \"overvalued reeeee,\" and they have a point, BB stock isn't exactly cheap. As it trades at roughly 8X forward sales, BB is valued as a fast growing company, but not beyond the likes of PLTR &amp; SNOW (yes different industries, but valuations that are multiple times higher) or competitors like Palo Alto Networks or Cisco. As a graduate student attempting to be not completely rarted with my limited capital, I love the risk-reward for BB, especially considering they report earnings on June 22. I suspect these numbers will come in far stronger than the St is saying, and at least they will start to lift future guidance in a significant way (both catalysts for a 50-100% move in BB IMHO). I guess we'll see how the financials reward BB's transition, but I am truly convinced this is the AMD of cybersecurity.\n* This last part is a mixed-bag (but suspicious if we dive deeper), and I'm sure a lot of apes will downvote me and possibly completely avoid BB with this knowledge, but I want to share facts since they are evidently so hard to find. We got the usual mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, etc) who own BB (roughly 25%) and two woke funds who invest in \"innovative trends\" own the other 15%. But data does indicate nasty little Ken (Citadel) reported buying 1.3M shares of BB in Q1. BB was heavily shorted pre-GME (like 30%+), and Citadel/gey bears almost definitely bought shares to cover. The question I'm wondering was did Citadel actually buy BB b/c they were so worried about a squeeze since it is a legitimate growth stock or b/c he shares my sentiments about its turnaround? Regardless, both seem like positive catalysts for the stock, and hopefully Ken answers my question.... oh wait...\n\n[Self-explanatory.](https://preview.redd.it/w33d8rdaxd371.png?width=1886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab406b459250bc6669c79e67c65c145f9b879709)\n\nObligatiory: BB to the moon.",

But perhaps more importantly, formerly deeply out-of-favor speculative growth stocks, many of them associated with Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK funds, have begun to rebound.\n\n### SPECULATIVE TECH\n\n**SPECULATIVE TECH** **SINCE MAY 12** **ZOOM VIDEO-up 15% ROKU-up 11% SHOPIFY-up 11% SPOTIFY-up 8% TELADOC-up 6%**\n\n## The changing market narrative\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nThe market narrative is changing. The first quarter storyline was that the reopening would be very strong, bond yields would move up, and inflation may be an issue later in the year.\n\nThis was only partially correct. The reopening has been strong, but bond yields have come down, not up, as investors have come to believe 1) that inflation and supply-chain issues may indeed be \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, as the Federal Reserve has insisted, and 2) that the second and third quarter is the top in earnings and economic growth.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe value trade is unwinding, and the growth bulls are winning,\u201d Alec Young, chief investment officer at Tactical Alpha, told me. \u201cBond yields are a proxy on the growth outlook,\u201d he added, noting that bond investors see moderating inflation and a slower rate of growth (though still positive) in the second half of the year.\n\nThe result: Investors are staying in the market, but they are rotating into defensives (health care) and growth (technology). Formerly crowded trades like cyclicals and banks that are associated with the \u201cvalue trade\u201d are now retreating.\u00a0\n\nWhy would investors rotate into growth stocks if growth is slowing?\n\n\u201cValue is a more economically sensitive sector because value is weighted toward industrials, energy, materials, and small caps,\u201d Young said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cEarly in the economic cycle, coming out of a recession, there is more earnings leverage from value stocks, so they are a better investment,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that everything has been compressed,\u201d Young said.\u00a0\u201cWe went into a recession really fast, and we came out of it fast, partly due to all the stimulus. Growth stocks now offer more reliable growth and are less subject to the vagaries of the economic cycle.\u201d\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs\u2019 Ben Snider and David Kostin agreed. \u201cHistory, valuations, positioning, and economic deceleration indicate that most of the rotation \\[from growth to value\\] is behind us,\u201d they said.\n\nBecause this was a \u201ccrowded\u201d (overweight) trade, Goldman suggested that many players are likely caught offsides. \u201cMutual funds are overweight Value to a larger degree than any time in our eight-year data history,\u201d they said. \u201cHedge funds remain tilted toward Growth, but that tilt has recently fallen sharply and now ranks as the lowest in over five years.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Below is a breakdown of a recent WSJ article about 5G in the US. I added some bullets throughout the article  based on some research.  Even though I disagree with a few of the author's points, I think it's a solid article and helped me understand 5G a bit more. \n\nAt the end, I included some of my own opinions. Hopefully this helps everyone better understand what is going on right now. I have a large position in one of these companies. I have decided to keep it out of this sub, but if you check my post history I am sure you can figure it out. \n\n**The U.S. Is Back in the 5G Game**\n\n*By* Stu Woo*,* May 26, 2021 12:00 pm ET\n\nThe U.S. government has upended the **$35 billion-a-year cellular-equipment industry**, ushering in a new era of competition and giving U.S. companies a shot at re-entering a sector they vacated years ago.\n\n\u00b7 The $35 billion number they reference here only refers to the US. 2020 estimates the industry in the mid $400 billion range and most projections see this industry growing to the mid $500 billion range by 2023 and mid $700 billion range by 2027. \n\nIn the past five years, only China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co., Sweden\u2019s Ericsson and Finland\u2019s Nokia Corp. captured more than a 20% share of revenue in the wireless-equipment market, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group, a research firm. **No other competitor consistently cracked even 10%.**\n\n\u00b7 Huawei: 2020 revenue was $136.7 billion, not publicly traded so no market cap, 180,000+ employees\n\n\u00b7 Ericsson (ERIC): 2020 revenue of $25.3 billion, market cap of $44.4 billion, valuation of 1.75X, 100K employees\n\n\u00b7 Nokia (NOK): 2020 revenue of $24.96 billion, market cap of $29.8 billion, valuation of 1.19X, 92k employees\n\nNow that landscape is [changing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-loses-cellular-gear-market-share-outside-china-11615118400?mod=article_inline). Pushed by Washington\u2019s campaign to cripple Huawei over cybersecurity concerns, **countries representing more than 60% of the world\u2019s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against Huawei**, says Dell\u2019Oro Group. And to take advantage of that opening, the U.S. government\u2014as well as governments in the U.K. and European Union\u2014are considering financial support and other measures to boost domestic cellular-equipment makers trying to crack the three incumbents\u2019 stranglehold on the market.\n\nThe result is a newly competitive market that is reminiscent of the 1990s, when bygone industry giants such as Lucent, Motorola, Nortel, Siemens and Alcatel fought for a piece of a growing telecom-equipment pie.\n\n\u00b7 Lucent merged with Alcatel in 2006 to form Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia absorbed Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. \n\n\u00b7 Motorola split into Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions in 2011. Google acquired Motorola Mobility which, focuses on phones, in 2012 which was then sold to Lenovo in 2015. Motorola Solutions (MSI) 2020 revenue of $7.4 billion, market cap of $35.2 billion, valuation of 4.76X, 18K employees.\n\no MSI appears to focus on smaller, private networks especially in public safety. \n\n\u00b7 Nortel: Went bankrupt in 2009 and Ericsson purchased most of its telecommunication assets over the next few years. \n\n\u00b7 Siemens (SIEGY): 2020 revenue of $69.4 billion, market cap of $140.6 billion, valuation of 2.03X, 293k employees (manufactures switchboards and 5G routers)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a Wild West feel to it,\u201d says Bill Plummer, a former Nokia and Huawei executive now working at JMA Wireless, a Syracuse, N.Y., 5G company. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this since probably the eve of the dot-com bust\u2014this dynamic and thriving competitive environment in wireless.\u201d\n\nThat new environment could benefit everyone\u2014other than, of course, Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. It will give a host of competitors a chance to win business that only a couple of years ago seemed out of reach. And the new competitive fervor should increase innovation and lower costs for wireless carriers, which could pass on savings\u2014and the fruits of those innovations\u2014to customers.\n\nAmerican officials further say the new competitive landscape is crucial to U.S. efforts to counter China\u2019s influence in developing 5G technology, **the next generation of wireless technology that will serve as the building blocks for all sorts of future technologies\u2014whether in robot-run factories, heart-rate monitors, or any number of industries and products. The country that dominates 5G will be well-positioned to lead the technology industry in terms of profits and talent in the years ahead.**\n\n**The 3G days**\n\nAfter a vibrant start to the 3G era in the 2000s, when manufacturers throughout North America, Europe and Asia competed, equipment manufacturers started consolidating amid pressure from Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE Corp. which were both selling increasingly competitive hardware at lower prices. In 2016, Nokia\u2019s acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, itself a merger of French and American companies, created today\u2019s three-giant oligopoly.\n\nThe Trump administration began loosening the trio\u2019s grip on the market in 2018 when it started urging allies to blacklist industry leader Huawei over national-security concerns. **The campaign worked: Huawei lost market share outside China to both Ericsson and Nokia last year**, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group, as governments enacted or considered restrictions on Huawei\u2019s equipment.\n\n\u201cThe big change over the past couple of years is pressure on Huawei,\u201d says James Barford, a telecom analyst for Enders Analysis. \u201cEven in countries where there is no formal ban, you\u2019re going to be thinking twice\u201d about using equipment from the Chinese company.\n\nThe stranglehold of the big three was further weakened by Nokia\u2019s blunder in procuring expensive chips for its 5G equipment\u2014a mistake that resulted in its equipment costing more upfront, as well as consuming more power. That\u2019s an issue for wireless carriers, which can spend roughly 20% of operating expenses on energy. Nokia says it has since moved to cheaper, power-efficient chips, but damage was done: Some carriers looked elsewhere for supplies.\n\n\u00b7 This appears to still be up in the air, but Pekka Lundmark, Nokia\u2019s CEO, seemed adamant in an interview after Q1 that chips are no longer an issue for Nokia. We shall see. \n\nWith both Huawei and Nokia under pressure, that left Ericsson as the market leader outside China. But that, in turn, made wireless carriers\u2019 executives wary. They say they want more competition to increase innovation and reduce costs.\n\nThe result has been an opening for a whole new generation of competitors\u2014and the Wild West environment.\n\n**The open gambit**\n\nSome carriers are turning to Samsung Electronics Co. , the South Korean smartphone giant that is a relative newcomer to the wireless-infrastructure industry. It ranked fifth behind the three giants and China\u2019s ZTE in 2020, but won a major victory last year when Verizon Communications Inc. switched suppliers from Nokia to Samsung.\n\n\u00b7 ZTE: 2020 revenue of $15.86 billion, market cap of $21.84 billion, valuation of 1.38X, 74k employees (traded on Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges)\n\n\u00b7 Samsung: 2020 revenue of $212 billion, market cap of $500 billion, valuation of 2.36X, 109k or 284K employees (traded on Korean Stock Market)\n\nBut it\u2019s the possibility of buying 5G equipment using open-standards software that has the most potential for roiling the competitive order.\n\nTo understand why, consider that the cellular equipment that transmits signals to phones consists of three parts: the antenna, hardware that sits on a pole directly under the antenna, and more hardware at the pole\u2019s base. **Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia currently sell all three parts in a bundle, and they aren\u2019t interoperable**. For instance, a Huawei antenna doesn\u2019t work with Ericsson electronics under the antenna.\n\nIt would be like buying a Dell laptop that works with only a Dell monitor and Dell printer. And it means customers have limited options on price, quality and features.\n\nEnter a new technology based on open standards, dubbed **Open RAN**, or radio access network. Companies making equipment based on these standards **allow wireless carriers to mix and match the antennas with different under-antenna hardware and centralized electronics**. That gives carriers more options for cost and quality.\n\n\u00b7 Huawei: Does not believe in the use of Open RAN.\n\n\u00b7 Ericsson: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 Nokia: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 ZTE: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 Samsung: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\nThe U.S. government is a major backer of the open-software efforts, which officials say could boost both U.S. national security and business. It potentially can help U.S. businesses by creating openings for new players, and because these new efforts rely less on hardware (where the U.S. has fallen behind) and more on software (where companies such as [**Microsoft**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) **Corp**. and [**International Business Machines**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IBM) **Corp**. can potentially play a role).\n\n\u00b7 Microsoft: Partnership with Ericsson focuses on the auto industry. Partnership with Nokia focuses on cloud solutions for enterprise. Dealings with Huawei appear to be smartphone based, not 5G. \n\n\u00b7 IBM: Has partnered with Ericsson in the past, but appears to be working more closely with Nokia and Samsung recently. \n\n\u201cWe may be able to increase security, reduce our exposure to any single foreign vendor, lower costs and push the equipment market to where the United States is uniquely skilled\u2014in software,\u201d Federal Communications Commission Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in March.\n\nIf U.S. companies do indeed become major players in 5G equipment, then they can also play a bigger role in setting global standards for telecom equipment. That\u2019s an arena where China has made great strides. U.S. officials prefer that companies in the U.S. and allied democracies set wireless standards, which they believe would lead to greater, less hackable security.\n\nPresident Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide last month agreed that the U.S. and Japan would collaborate to advance open 5G networks \u201cby fostering innovation and by promoting trustworthy vendors and diverse markets,\u201d the White House said. Congress this year enacted a law to establish a Commerce Department fund that would award grants to support the use of such open-standards equipment in the U.S. A bipartisan group of lawmakers backing the bill requested $750 million for the fund in fiscal year 2022.\n\nIn the U.K., a government-appointed task force to help British wireless carriers transition away from Huawei equipment recommended that new equipment makers, or those using open-standards software, represent 25% of the country\u2019s wireless infrastructure by the mid-2020s. The task force recommended government incentives for wireless carriers buying such equipment, and for suppliers to locate research facilities in the U.K. The European Union this year started examining similar options.\n\n**The focus of newcomers**\n\nSeveral smaller U.S. companies\u2014such as [Airspan Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AIRO), Altiostar, Mavenir, JMA and Parallel Wireless\u2014are focused on 5G equipment using open software. Ericsson and Nokia are also shifting to using some open-standard software.\n\nThe new challengers have signed deals with some big carriers. [AT&amp;T](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) Inc. is testing open-standards equipment and plans to gradually introduce it, while newcomer wireless-carrier [Dish Network](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DISH) Corp. has said its entire network would rely on such infrastructure.\n\n\u00b7 [Airspan Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AIRO) (AIRO): 2020 revenue was $54.7 million, market cap of 11.9 million, valuation of 0.22X, 900 employees\n\n\u00b7 Altiostar: 2020 revenue was $10-50 million, not publicly traded so no market cap, 359 employees, they are pre IPO and Qualcomm is an investor\n\n\u00b7 Mavenir (MVNR): 2020 revenue was $462 million, market cap of $1.72 billion, valuation of 3.72X, 4,200employees\n\n\u00b7 JMA: 2020 revenue was $369 million, not publicly traded so no market cap, 1,000 employees\n\n\u00b7 Parallel Wireless: 2020 revenue was $75 million , not publicly traded so no market cap, 450 employees\n\n\u00b7 Dish Network Corp: Rumored to be trying to become the 4th major US network behind Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile. Partnered with Nokia on 5G software. Has worked with Ericsson in the past, but has been working closer with Mavenir and Qualcomm lately. \n\n\u00b7 AT&amp;T: Has 5 year deal with Nokia for 5G services. Also has a deal with Nokia on 5G software. Partners with Ericsson on Private 5G Networks. Appears to be trying to move away from Huawei, but still works with them outside of US. \n\nDell\u2019Oro Group predicts that equipment using open standards, from both newcomers and incumbents transitioning into the new market, **will capture 10% of the market by 2025**.\n\n\u201cThe operators say, \u2018We need choice, we need a strong ecosystem,\u2019 \u201d says Thierry Maupil\u00e9, a former Motorola and [Cisco Systems](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CSCO) Inc. executive who now works at Altiostar, which provides software for open-standards 5G equipment. **\u201cYou have a playing field that has been reduced to a few companies.\u201d**\n\nStill, **open-standards equipment remains in its early stages**, and it is too soon to know whether it will be a major player. Wireless carriers say their tests of open-standards equipment show some drawbacks. The new technology can be less energy-efficient than today\u2019s conventional systems. And while the open-standards equipment can be used in rural areas, its performance isn\u2019t yet up to snuff in densely populated urban areas.\n\n**But wireless carriers expect the open-standards equipment to be on par with Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia equipment in three or four years.**\n\n\u201cFor us, it is critical to maintain competition in our vendor system,\u201d says Michael Trabbia, chief technology officer at French carrier Orange SA. **\u201cWe cannot end up with only two players.\u201d**\n\n\u00b7 The two players are of course Nokia and Ericsson with Huawei more and more out of the picture with more than 60% of the world\u2019s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against them. Similar bans are being placed on ZTE so Nokia and Ericsson should continue to gain market share. This could also help Samsung, but I feel like their focus is elsewhere as a company. \n\n\u00b7 I\u2019ve kept things fact based up until now and will close with an opinion. Nokia and Ericsson appear to have an establishing duopoly in an industry that the US government has now twice admitted is massively important to the future technological success of all countries. \n\n\u00b7 So much so that they are looking to spend money to try to help US based competitors of Nokia and Ericsson. The new competitors this article mentions are all small and well behind what the tech giants provide. Even with US funding they are not too worrisome. Mavenir seems like the most legitimate threat, but they already have a valuation multiple higher than Nokia and Ericsson. I don\u2019t really see a fund of $750 million dollars split across 5 companies making much of a difference at the end of the day either. \n\n\u00b7 Open RAN may be the future, but that is long ways away. This article suggests that a move to Open RAN in the US will hurt Nokia and Ericsson and help the smaller guys. I do not believe that will be the case. The tech giants will stay ahead of the smaller guys the same way they have done with hardware. And even if they do not the article states that it should make up only 10% of the market by 2021.",

        "selftext": "(CSE:DIGI), (OTC: DBKSF)\n\nWith Digicyrypts recently officially rebranding itself to DigiMax recently I thought it would be a great time to share some DD and overall a brief summary of what these guys are doing and why I like them so much. So without further ado...\n\nDigimax is a Canadian company that focuses on AI and predictive tech. They have got a great team behind them and have several different services that they offer using this advanced technology. These services stretch into several sectors like financial, HR, crypto, and logistics, and all use a similar, constantly improving AI engine. Personally, I'll never get over just how cool AI as a concept is, what once seemed to be the stuff of sci-fi films is now very much so a reality. This engine is extremely effective at completing different types of analysis and predicting trends without the need for human influence or intervention.\n\nTheir first service I want to highlight is DataNavee. This is an engine for commercial business use and helps analyze trends in several factors associated with running a large or small business. These factors and indicators include sales, revenues, and supply chain quantities, all figures that are key to running a smooth business. DataNavee takes companies existing figures and extrapolates and interprets them allowing business owners to choose the best course of action based on the AI's highly advanced projections.\n\nFor anyone who is a big fan of crypto investments, they have their Crypto tracking and predicting service known as CryptoHawk. Once again using an advanced AI, it is able to track the prices and trends of Bitcoin and Etherium and make projections about future fluctuations. This service, in particular, is getting a huge improvement in the near future as Digimax brought on Delphi Anlaytics' crypto division to improve the accuracy of analysis and add other cryptocurrencies. This service generates SAAS revenue and has seen some impressive demand. In the same vein as crypto, they also look to open their own crypto fund which will be supported by their acquisitions of Kirobo and Barberton Fund this year.\n\nI am super impressed with the different revenue streams DigiMax and I still haven't even mentioned Darwin Ecosystem, a system that uses a projected personality interpreter to make hiring decisions. This particular project was made with IBM Watson and is currently used by 17 law enforcement agencies.\n\nWith the upcoming summer launch of their Crypto fund along with advancements in their other projects, DigiMax is looking to take the tech world by storm and offer industry-topping services. While this may be a big vision for a company with a $0.17 stock price, I definitely think it's within the realm of what's possible and for that reason, they are on my list!\n\nDisclaimer: DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, this ain't investment advice!",

        "selftext": "mCloud Technologies (Ticker: MCLDF) is a 10 bagger in the making. mCloud has identified a niche opportunity to optimize energy assets for all businesses to contribute to higher ESG scores and overall energy savings. Bank of America (TICKER: BAC) **HAS ALL 3,300 of their branches connected to their software and SAVED roughly $40,000,000 through improved efficiencies (5). The savings they generated EXCEEDED the amount paid for the subscription.** \n\nQuick facts:\n\n*  WILL BE CASH FLOW POSITIVE by mid Q3 2021.\n* Quick Ratio well over 1\n* Price-to-Sales below 2\n* Gross Margins of 61%\n* SaaS company with 273% Net Dollar Retention and ZERO attrition currently serving an untapped market (Unbelievable)\n* Currently have 60,000 subscribers (Connect assets) which include blue-chip customers like McDonalds (Ticker: MCD), Planet Fitness (Ticker: PLNT), Starbucks (Ticker: SBUX), Telus (Ticker: T.TO) , Longyuen (Largest wind farm in China), etc (AND GROWING).\n* Comparables: Aspen Technologies (Ticker: AZPN), Honeywell (Ticker: HON), C3AI (Ticker: AI).\n* Stock price is down because COVID-19 restricted them from going to clients and connecting them. HUGE tailwinds as resections lift. \n* Five days ago (May 27th, 2021) Jack Vander Aarde from Maxim Group reiterated a \"BUY\" rating with a **price target of $5 (242% upside).** His recommendations have generated a 110% return while being a tracked analyst on TD Ameritrade with a success rate of 74%, ranking 13th out of 7,533 tracked analysts... No fluff here just facts.\n\nThe first component of the *AssetCareTM* foundation (Their SaaS product) is the IoT sensors that are attached to client\u2019s assets (HVAC Systems, Wind Turbines, Electrical Transformers, Nuclear Power Plants, Heat Exchangers, etc.). The same way IoT sensors in an Apple Watch track the distance and speed you've ran or your sleeping patterns and heartbeat, mCloud's IoT sensors track real time asset data in buildings, oil and gas facilities, and wind farms. Some examples of the data points tracked are Kilowatt/hour usage (HVAC), outdoor temperature (HVAC), heating and cooling effectiveness (HVAC), system run-times (HVAC), heat transfer and viscosity (Oil and Gas), control systems (Oil and Gas), blade speed (Wind), etc. All of the respective information is collected, combined, and stored in the cloud where analytics are applied and correlations are made to directly decrease operating costs and provide better insight on the assets overall health (As oppose to traditional \"straight-line\" deprecation methods). These sensors years ago were very expensive and could not feasibly be used in providing a price-conscience product to consumers. With new advances in technology, the price of these sensors have dropped dramatically and the accuracy of the data they can accumulate has improved significantly. \n\nThe next foundational piece to their product is the cloud. In the 20th century companies had hardware that took up the size of entire rooms to store a fraction of data/information that can be stored today in a victual cloud. Now in the 21st century, big cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and IBM viciously compete for customers, driving the price of storage down exponentially. With mCloud sensors tracking data 24/7/365, they now have a place to store and analyze it cheaply for its current 60,000 connected assets (and growing). The amount of storage needed for this *AssetCareTM* product was non-existent years ago and not available at a viable cost.\n\nLastly, with the cloud able to store all the data generated 24/7/365, data and analytics can now viably be applied to the entire data set. Traditionally in the late 20th century and early 21st century, organizations were only able to take a sample of the data available and come up with limited conclusions. Now with a place to store all data, companies like mCloud can provide an extremely more accurate analysis on the performance and health of any asset by identifying immensely more accurate anomalies and trends.\n\n**Summary**\n\nmCloud is unlocking the untapped potential of energy intensive assets with AI and analytics, curbing energy waste, maximizing energy production, and getting the most out of critical energy infrastructure. Through mCloud's AI-powered AssetCare\u2122 platform, mCloud offers complete asset management solutions for commercial buildings, renewable energy, healthcare, heavy industry, and connected workers. IoT sensors bring data from connected assets into the cloud, where AI and analytics are applied to maximize their performance.",

The suit comes as GlobalFoundries works with banks on an initial public offering that could value the chipmaker at about $30 billion.\n\n\u201cThis action arises out of what seems to be a misguided and ill-conceived effort by IBM\u2019s law department to try to extract an outlandish payment,\u201d GlobalFoundries said its complaint.\n\nIBM agreed in 2014 to pay GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion for GlobalFoundries to acquire the unit. As part of the deal, GlobalFoundries became IBM\u2019s exclusive provider of certain power processors for the next 10 years, in exchange for access to IBM\u2019s intellectual property. GlobalFoundries acquired manufacturing facilities in East Fishkill, New York, and Essex Junction, Vermont.\n\nGlobalFoundries is backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Co. The chipmaker is coming to market as numerous industries complain they can\u2019t get enough semiconductor supply and governments across the globe gear up to provide financial support for expansions in production.\n\nA call and email to IBM wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\n\n\u2018Highly Suspect\u2019\n\nIn its lawsuit, GlobalFoundries said IBM\u2019s request for damages is \u201chighly suspect\u201d as it follows news of the potential IPO. GlobalFoundries also said that IBM \u201chas yet to provide any substantive explanation\u201d to its claims over the alleged breach.\n\nGlobalFoundries said in its lawsuit that it invested billions of dollars to develop cutting-edge chip-making technology, but that it decided not to pursue IBM\u2019s \u201cfailing strategy\u201d and notified IBM in 2018.\n\nAccording to the filing, development of the chip-technology was more challenging and expensive than initially anticipated, causing delays in the project\u2019s targeted milestones. GlobalFoundries says it spent more money to catch up but still fell behind competitors including Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. It also alleges IBM was \u201cwell aware\u201d of delays and the switch to Samsung was beneficial for the company as it was cheaper and faster than GlobalFoundries would have been able deliver.\n\nIBM didn\u2019t complain about GlobalFoundries\u2019 actions until news of its potential IPO broke, and it now seeks \u201ca quick payday,\u201d GlobalFoundries alleges.\n\nThe case is GlobalFoundries v. IBM, New York Supreme Court, New York County.\n\n(Updates with details of complaint)\n\nMore stories like this are available on [bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/)\n\n[Subscribe now](https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/67obqkd5zdp5lj8/?utm_source=yahoo_usn) to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",
