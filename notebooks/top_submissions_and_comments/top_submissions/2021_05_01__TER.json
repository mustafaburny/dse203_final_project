        "selftext": "What if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. \n\nCohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. \n\n**Bullish trends**\n\n1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. \n2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?\n3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Nvidia are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.\n4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.\n5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. \n\n**Bearish trends**\n\n1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). \n2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. \n3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).\n\n**Fundamental analysis**\n\nI use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing, I don't like p/e because it can be manipulated by the # of shares issued).\n\nCohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000\n\n$316 million/$1925 million=6.09\n\nThis is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. \n\nCohu-6.09\n\naapl-19.12\n\namzn-18\n\nter-11.3\n\nadvantest-7.19\n\nswks-17.9\n\nIf cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.\n\nTaking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \\~$200 million today versus \\~$300 million a year ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Technical analysis**\n\n[Cohu 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/pav84wurgjw61.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e)\n\nAs we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. \n\nIn conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years). \n\nDisclaimer: I'm holding call options on this company. \n\ncheers",
