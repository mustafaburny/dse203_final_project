        "selftext": "Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. Management\n\nAs part of Paysafe\u2019s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they\u2019ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They\u2019ve hired PayPal\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook\u2019s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl\u2019s Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.\n\nStill, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe\u2019s value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader\u2019s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.\n\nRegardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of [Visa](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/skrill-usa-launches-skrill-virtual-visar-prepaid-card-in-us/), [Coinbase](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-issues-coinbase-s-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/), [Fubo Gaming](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-streamlines-payments-for-interactive-wagering-with-fubo-gaming-in-us/), [FOXbet](https://www.njgamblingfun.com/nj/sports-news/paysafe-continues-its-push-into-online-gaming), [Golden Nugget](http://www.greensheet.com/newswire.php?newswire_id=53685), [Bankable](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-partners-with-bankable-to-provide-omnichannel-banking-services/), [Wix](https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2021/smbs-can-accept-payments-with-paysafe-skrill-on-wix/), [Repay](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), [WynnBet](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/wynnbet-taps-paysafe-for-payments-and-marketing-solutions/), [Betfred USA](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-expands-betfred-usa-sports-partnership-through-income-access-deal/), [OwnersBox](https://incomeaccess.com/contenthub/ownersbox-launches-affiliate-program/), [Dutch neobank bunq](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/bunq-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-cash-deposits-for-digital-banking/), [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/), Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, [Smart Property Systems](https://globalfintechseries.com/banking/digital-payments/paysafe-partners-with-smart-property-systems-in-north-america/), Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, [Montana Lottery](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-powers-online-payments-for-montana-lotterys-sportsbook/), PlayUP, [SuperBook Sports](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-platform-launches-with-superbook-sports-in-colorado-and-new-jersey/) and [Bitrise](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-accelerates-innovation-with-bitrise-for-faster-digital-wallets-payments/).\n\nIn that same period, they\u2019ve also:\n\n* expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to [48 states](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-skrill-expands-its-crypto-service/),\n* expanded their digital wallets to [trade](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-neteller-launches-fiat-to-crypto-withdrawal-service/) 38 \\[digital\\]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies\n* launched online cash payments on Microsoft\u2019s [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) in 22 countries\n* struck deals with [Snowflake](https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/paysafe-integrates-snowflake-to-power-cloud-based-approach-for-enhanced-customer-experiences/) and Amazon\u2019s [AWS](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/paysafe-partners-aws-to-become-cloud-based-payments-provider/) to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition,\n* [launched](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) a new global travel safeguarding model,\n* a unique innovation that quickly led to a new [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally.\n\nAlso during this time, they announced the appointments of:\n\n* Digital wallet division CEO, [Chirag Patel](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-chirag-patel-to-lead-its-digital-wallets-division/) (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander)\n* North American iGaming CEO, [Zak Cutler](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-zak-cutler-to-lead-its-north-america-igaming-business/) (fmr DraftKings exec),\n* Boardmember [Mark Brooker](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/paysafe-appoints-mark-brooker-as-non-exec-director/) (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill)\n\nAll that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada\u2019s [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeding the future growth right now\u2026 The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective\u2026It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\u201d  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.\n\nLastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.\n\nThe types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe\u2019s \u201cvalue creation playbook\u201d which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), \u201cthose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s worth underscoring Foley\u2019s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He\u2019s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, \u201cMy whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.\u201d  Though he\u2019s not Paysafe\u2019s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that \u201c  Bill is highly engaged with the company.\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. Lockup Expiration\n\nSome bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe\u2019s value creation playbook. Between Foley\u2019s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone\u2019s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.\n\nUpon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified \u201cbase returns for a four year hold period\u201d of \u201c2.9x to 3.8x\u201d from $10.  \n\nFrom their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): \u201cThe Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. Valuation\n\nPaysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.\n\nNow trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner\u2019s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.\n\nOr maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a \"300% higher\" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of \u201c$3.7 billion\u201d, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.\n\nInitially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE\u2019s financial data, like YF\u2019s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  It\u2019s not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.\n\nObviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.\n\nTrue price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil then, here are a few reference points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment as a separate company:\n\nThe eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.\n\nAdyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen\u2019s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe\u2019s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That\u2019s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.\n\nUsing Adyen\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company\u2019s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.\n\nAgain, that represents less than a third of Paysafe\u2019s total business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing\n\nPaysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.\n\nFor 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. \n\nIn all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDigital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet\n\nMany compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here\u2019s a deeper look into that comparison:\n\nAs noted earlier, Paysafe\u2019s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.\n\nBy comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal\u2019s troubles as a \u201cbuying opportunity.\u201d\n\nSome will reasonably say that\u2019s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal\u2019s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).\n\nPaysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020\u2019s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe\u2019s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal\u2019s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.\n\nPaysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a \u201cfree cash flow machine,\u201d Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).\n\nThere\u2019s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL\u2019s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE\u2019s potential acquisition debt and dilution:\n\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90\n* PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75\n* PayPal\u2019s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41\n\nThose metrics average to a share price of $27.31\n\nWhen factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSector multiples:\n\nBecause Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \\~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.\n\nAfter removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here\u2019s Paysafe\u2019s share price with the averaged peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67\n* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17\n* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72\n\nAverage : $41.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS\u2019s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE\u2019s recent price action, but certainly not all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, \u201cthe market doesn\u2019t care,\u201d but I\u2019m confident that\u2019ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER\u2019s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of \u201clook at the chart\u201d and \u201cprice is truth.\u201d  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.\n\nNo, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, \u201cThe stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.\u201d\n\nDo with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.  Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I\u2019d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",

        "selftext": "Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qlw7ro/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe_parts_57/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. Management\n\nAs part of Paysafe\u2019s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they\u2019ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They\u2019ve hired PayPal\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook\u2019s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl\u2019s Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.\n\nStill, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe\u2019s value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader\u2019s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.\n\nRegardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of [Visa](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/skrill-usa-launches-skrill-virtual-visar-prepaid-card-in-us/), [Coinbase](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-issues-coinbase-s-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/), [Fubo Gaming](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-streamlines-payments-for-interactive-wagering-with-fubo-gaming-in-us/), [FOXbet](https://www.njgamblingfun.com/nj/sports-news/paysafe-continues-its-push-into-online-gaming), [Golden Nugget](http://www.greensheet.com/newswire.php?newswire_id=53685), [Bankable](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-partners-with-bankable-to-provide-omnichannel-banking-services/), [Wix](https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2021/smbs-can-accept-payments-with-paysafe-skrill-on-wix/), [Repay](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), [WynnBet](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/wynnbet-taps-paysafe-for-payments-and-marketing-solutions/), [Betfred USA](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-expands-betfred-usa-sports-partnership-through-income-access-deal/), [OwnersBox](https://incomeaccess.com/contenthub/ownersbox-launches-affiliate-program/), [Dutch neobank bunq](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/bunq-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-cash-deposits-for-digital-banking/), [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/), Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, [Smart Property Systems](https://globalfintechseries.com/banking/digital-payments/paysafe-partners-with-smart-property-systems-in-north-america/), Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, [Montana Lottery](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-powers-online-payments-for-montana-lotterys-sportsbook/), PlayUP, [SuperBook Sports](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-platform-launches-with-superbook-sports-in-colorado-and-new-jersey/) and [Bitrise](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-accelerates-innovation-with-bitrise-for-faster-digital-wallets-payments/).\n\nIn that same period, they\u2019ve also:\n\n* expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to [48 states](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-skrill-expands-its-crypto-service/),\n* expanded their digital wallets to [trade](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-neteller-launches-fiat-to-crypto-withdrawal-service/) 38 \\[digital\\]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies\n* launched online cash payments on Microsoft\u2019s [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) in 22 countries\n* struck deals with [Snowflake](https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/paysafe-integrates-snowflake-to-power-cloud-based-approach-for-enhanced-customer-experiences/) and Amazon\u2019s [AWS](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/paysafe-partners-aws-to-become-cloud-based-payments-provider/) to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition,\n* [launched](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) a new global travel safeguarding model,\n* a unique innovation that quickly led to a new [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally.\n\nAlso during this time, they announced the appointments of:\n\n* Digital wallet division CEO, [Chirag Patel](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-chirag-patel-to-lead-its-digital-wallets-division/) (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander)\n* North American iGaming CEO, [Zak Cutler](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-zak-cutler-to-lead-its-north-america-igaming-business/) (fmr DraftKings exec),\n* Boardmember [Mark Brooker](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/paysafe-appoints-mark-brooker-as-non-exec-director/) (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill)\n\nAll that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada\u2019s [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeding the future growth right now\u2026 The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective\u2026It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\u201d  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.\n\nLastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.\n\nThe types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe\u2019s \u201cvalue creation playbook\u201d which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), \u201cthose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s worth underscoring Foley\u2019s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He\u2019s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, \u201cMy whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.\u201d  Though he\u2019s not Paysafe\u2019s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that \u201c  Bill is highly engaged with the company.\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. Lockup Expiration\n\nSome bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe\u2019s value creation playbook. Between Foley\u2019s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone\u2019s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.\n\nUpon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified \u201cbase returns for a four year hold period\u201d of \u201c2.9x to 3.8x\u201d from $10.\n\nFrom their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): \u201cThe Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. Valuation\n\nPaysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.\n\nNow trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner\u2019s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.\n\nOr maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a \"300% higher\" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of \u201c$3.7 billion\u201d, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.\n\nInitially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE\u2019s financial data, like YF\u2019s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  It\u2019s not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.\n\nObviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.\n\nTrue price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil then, here are a few reference points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment as a separate company:\n\nThe eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.\n\nAdyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen\u2019s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe\u2019s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That\u2019s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.\n\nUsing Adyen\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company\u2019s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.\n\nAgain, that represents less than a third of Paysafe\u2019s total business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing\n\nPaysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.\n\nFor 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively.\n\nIn all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDigital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet\n\nMany compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here\u2019s a deeper look into that comparison:\n\nAs noted earlier, Paysafe\u2019s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.\n\nBy comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal\u2019s troubles as a \u201cbuying opportunity.\u201d\n\nSome will reasonably say that\u2019s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal\u2019s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).\n\nPaysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020\u2019s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe\u2019s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal\u2019s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.\n\nPaysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a \u201cfree cash flow machine,\u201d Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).\n\nThere\u2019s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL\u2019s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE\u2019s potential acquisition debt and dilution:\n\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90\n* PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75\n* PayPal\u2019s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41\n\nThose metrics average to a share price of $27.31\n\nWhen factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSector multiples:\n\nBecause Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \\~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.\n\nAfter removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here\u2019s Paysafe\u2019s share price with the averaged peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67\n* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17\n* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72\n\nAverage : $41.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS\u2019s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE\u2019s recent price action, but certainly not all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, \u201cthe market doesn\u2019t care,\u201d but I\u2019m confident that\u2019ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER\u2019s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of \u201clook at the chart\u201d and \u201cprice is truth.\u201d  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.\n\nNo, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, \u201cThe stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.\u201d\n\nDo with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.  Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I\u2019d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as major averages hover near records; Tesla shares slide](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures were basically flat in early morning trading on Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a fresh record close on Monday to kick off November.\n*****\n&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 38 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures was lower by 0.15%\n*****\n&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes hit new intraday highs and closed at records during Monday\u2019s regular session as investors continue to bet on a year-end rally despite supply chain issues, Covid risk and a Federal Reserve that\u2019s about to indicate it\u2019s going to pull back on some stimulus. The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting begins Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged gains of 1.1% in November and 2.3% in December since 1936, notes Bank of America. The final month of the year is in the green 79% of the time, the firm notes. However, Bank of America is cautious.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to see downside risks ahead,\u201d wrote Savita Subramanian, the bank\u2019s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy. \u201cDespite a strong 7% beat, 2021-22 EPS remains largely unchanged, suggesting the upward revision cycle has likely peaked.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tesla shares cooled off Tuesday after popping during the end of October. Shares of the electric automaker tumbled 5% premarket, though they are up 55% over just the past month. The drop follows a report that the carmaker is recalling 11,700 of its vehicles due to a communications error, and a tweet from company founder Elon Musk that Tesla has yet to sign a contract with rental giant Hertz.\n*****\n&gt; Pfizer shares were up 1.8% in premarket trading after the drug maker\u2019s third-quarter profit topped expectations. It also raised its 2021 revenue and EPS outlook.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of materials giant DuPont de Nemours fell nearly 4% after the company said it is buying engineering materials technology maker Rogers Corp for $5.2 billion. DuPont also reported a 33% increase in adjusted third-quarter earnings.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour shares soared nearly 10% after the athletic retailer hiked its annual outlook.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, the Dow rose 94.3 points. The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.7%, its best daily performance since August.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday is expected to announce it will begin unwinding its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases implemented during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The October jobs report is on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe November FOMC meeting, October payrolls ... and a host of earnings updates sets up a catalyst heavy week of trading ahead,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Chris Hussey said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Better-than-expected corporate earnings results boosted the U.S. stock averages to finish October at record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posting their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; As of Monday evening according to FactSet, 55.8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly financial results, with 82% beating earnings estimates.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mbQdPjs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vaORLAk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9Rrbjyg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($PFE $CRSR $BP $UAA $COP $GNRC $EPD $RACE $EL $MPC $LPX $ARCB $GPN $CTLT $RL $BLMN $MPLX $IDXX $NRZ $CMI $BHC $ZBRA $IT $MGY $ESPR $DD $KKR $APO $ETN $AME $MIME $ADCT $ROK $TECH $INCY $LIND $BCC $SAGE $LGIH $IEP $LEA)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/53VLxUW.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LP69zIw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IWaFYUR.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/IA1HwBL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/n7GayLd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/h4f5OtE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ysSbo0i.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycH9aVx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zKN9CD3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Mm0cU5s.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/M0Y7bN5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/poUGTRm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gE6O83n.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TSLA\n* LRC.X\n* PFE\n* FSR\n* FCEL\n* CRSR\n* CHGG\n* DOT.X\n* VUZI\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-pfizer-under-armour-generac-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Pfizer (PFE)** \u2013 Pfizer jumped 4% in the premarket after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the third quarter.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as major averages hover near records; Tesla shares slide](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures were basically flat in early morning trading on Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a fresh record close on Monday to kick off November.\n*****\n&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 38 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures was lower by 0.15%\n*****\n&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes hit new intraday highs and closed at records during Monday\u2019s regular session as investors continue to bet on a year-end rally despite supply chain issues, Covid risk and a Federal Reserve that\u2019s about to indicate it\u2019s going to pull back on some stimulus. The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting begins Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged gains of 1.1% in November and 2.3% in December since 1936, notes Bank of America. The final month of the year is in the green 79% of the time, the firm notes. However, Bank of America is cautious.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to see downside risks ahead,\u201d wrote Savita Subramanian, the bank\u2019s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy. \u201cDespite a strong 7% beat, 2021-22 EPS remains largely unchanged, suggesting the upward revision cycle has likely peaked.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tesla shares cooled off Tuesday after popping during the end of October. Shares of the electric automaker tumbled 5% premarket, though they are up 55% over just the past month. The drop follows a report that the carmaker is recalling 11,700 of its vehicles due to a communications error, and a tweet from company founder Elon Musk that Tesla has yet to sign a contract with rental giant Hertz.\n*****\n&gt; Pfizer shares were up 1.8% in premarket trading after the drug maker\u2019s third-quarter profit topped expectations. It also raised its 2021 revenue and EPS outlook.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of materials giant DuPont de Nemours fell nearly 4% after the company said it is buying engineering materials technology maker Rogers Corp for $5.2 billion.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as major averages hover near records; Tesla shares slide](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures were basically flat in early morning trading on Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a fresh record close on Monday to kick off November.\n*****\n&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 38 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures was lower by 0.15%\n*****\n&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes hit new intraday highs and closed at records during Monday\u2019s regular session as investors continue to bet on a year-end rally despite supply chain issues, Covid risk and a Federal Reserve that\u2019s about to indicate it\u2019s going to pull back on some stimulus. The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting begins Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged gains of 1.1% in November and 2.3% in December since 1936, notes Bank of America. The final month of the year is in the green 79% of the time, the firm notes. However, Bank of America is cautious.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to see downside risks ahead,\u201d wrote Savita Subramanian, the bank\u2019s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy. \u201cDespite a strong 7% beat, 2021-22 EPS remains largely unchanged, suggesting the upward revision cycle has likely peaked.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tesla shares cooled off Tuesday after popping during the end of October. Shares of the electric automaker tumbled 5% premarket, though they are up 55% over just the past month. The drop follows a report that the carmaker is recalling 11,700 of its vehicles due to a communications error, and a tweet from company founder Elon Musk that Tesla has yet to sign a contract with rental giant Hertz.\n*****\n&gt; Pfizer shares were up 1.8% in premarket trading after the drug maker\u2019s third-quarter profit topped expectations. It also raised its 2021 revenue and EPS outlook.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of materials giant DuPont de Nemours fell nearly 4% after the company said it is buying engineering materials technology maker Rogers Corp for $5.2 billion. DuPont also reported a 33% increase in adjusted third-quarter earnings.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour shares soared nearly 10% after the athletic retailer hiked its annual outlook.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, the Dow rose 94.3 points. The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.7%, its best daily performance since August.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday is expected to announce it will begin unwinding its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases implemented during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The October jobs report is on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe November FOMC meeting, October payrolls ... and a host of earnings updates sets up a catalyst heavy week of trading ahead,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Chris Hussey said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Better-than-expected corporate earnings results boosted the U.S. stock averages to finish October at record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posting their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; As of Monday evening according to FactSet, 55.8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly financial results, with 82% beating earnings estimates.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mbQdPjs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vaORLAk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9Rrbjyg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($PFE $CRSR $BP $UAA $COP $GNRC $EPD $RACE $EL $MPC $LPX $ARCB $GPN $CTLT $RL $BLMN $MPLX $IDXX $NRZ $CMI $BHC $ZBRA $IT $MGY $ESPR $DD $KKR $APO $ETN $AME $MIME $ADCT $ROK $TECH $INCY $LIND $BCC $SAGE $LGIH $IEP $LEA)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/53VLxUW.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LP69zIw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IWaFYUR.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/IA1HwBL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/n7GayLd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/h4f5OtE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ysSbo0i.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycH9aVx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zKN9CD3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Mm0cU5s.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/M0Y7bN5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/poUGTRm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gE6O83n.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-pfizer-under-armour-generac-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Pfizer (PFE)** \u2013 Pfizer jumped 4% in the premarket after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the third quarter.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as major averages hover near records; Tesla shares slide](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures were basically flat in early morning trading on Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a fresh record close on Monday to kick off November.\n*****\n&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 38 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures was lower by 0.15%\n*****\n&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes hit new intraday highs and closed at records during Monday\u2019s regular session as investors continue to bet on a year-end rally despite supply chain issues, Covid risk and a Federal Reserve that\u2019s about to indicate it\u2019s going to pull back on some stimulus. The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting begins Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged gains of 1.1% in November and 2.3% in December since 1936, notes Bank of America. The final month of the year is in the green 79% of the time, the firm notes. However, Bank of America is cautious.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to see downside risks ahead,\u201d wrote Savita Subramanian, the bank\u2019s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy. \u201cDespite a strong 7% beat, 2021-22 EPS remains largely unchanged, suggesting the upward revision cycle has likely peaked.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tesla shares cooled off Tuesday after popping during the end of October. Shares of the electric automaker tumbled 5% premarket, though they are up 55% over just the past month. The drop follows a report that the carmaker is recalling 11,700 of its vehicles due to a communications error, and a tweet from company founder Elon Musk that Tesla has yet to sign a contract with rental giant Hertz.\n*****\n&gt; Pfizer shares were up 1.8% in premarket trading after the drug maker\u2019s third-quarter profit topped expectations. It also raised its 2021 revenue and EPS outlook.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of materials giant DuPont de Nemours fell nearly 4% after the company said it is buying engineering materials technology maker Rogers Corp for $5.2 billion. DuPont also reported a 33% increase in adjusted third-quarter earnings.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour shares soared nearly 10% after the athletic retailer hiked its annual outlook.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, the Dow rose 94.3 points. The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.7%, its best daily performance since August.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday is expected to announce it will begin unwinding its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases implemented during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The October jobs report is on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe November FOMC meeting, October payrolls ... and a host of earnings updates sets up a catalyst heavy week of trading ahead,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Chris Hussey said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Better-than-expected corporate earnings results boosted the U.S. stock averages to finish October at record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posting their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; As of Monday evening according to FactSet, 55.8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly financial results, with 82% beating earnings estimates.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mbQdPjs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vaORLAk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9Rrbjyg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($PFE $CRSR $BP $UAA $COP $GNRC $EPD $RACE $EL $MPC $LPX $ARCB $GPN $CTLT $RL $BLMN $MPLX $IDXX $NRZ $CMI $BHC $ZBRA $IT $MGY $ESPR $DD $KKR $APO $ETN $AME $MIME $ADCT $ROK $TECH $INCY $LIND $BCC $SAGE $LGIH $IEP $LEA)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/53VLxUW.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LP69zIw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IWaFYUR.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/IA1HwBL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/n7GayLd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/h4f5OtE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ysSbo0i.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycH9aVx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zKN9CD3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Mm0cU5s.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/M0Y7bN5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/poUGTRm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gE6O83n.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TSLA\n* LRC.X\n* PFE\n* FSR\n* FCEL\n* CRSR\n* CHGG\n* DOT.X\n* VUZI\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-pfizer-under-armour-generac-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Pfizer (PFE)** \u2013 Pfizer jumped 4% in the premarket after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the third quarter.
