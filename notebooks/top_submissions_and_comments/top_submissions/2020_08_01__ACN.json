I\u2019m basically going all-in, all the time.\n\nI went all-in on Tesla for a week, made profit and got out, then went all-in on ACN, made profit and got out, now I\u2019m on BABA.\n\nBasically before going all-in, I look at a 5 year trend of the company, see if it\u2019s generally going upwards, then a 5 day trend, then to see the day spike and the news.\n\nIf all 3 are going up, all-in. If it so happens to go down on open and I lose 1%, take that as a handicap for the week and hold until it gives profit (might be 2-3 weeks, but based on trends, not too long).\n\nAlways use a Stop Loss of 2.5% to be safe.\n\nWhat is this called?\n\nI know it\u2019s common, because I started watching this TV show Wall Street (something something), and a guy on there mentioned the same thing.",
