        "selftext": "By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares.

The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c\n\nGameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.\n\n**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported\n\n* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.\n\n**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab\u2122 stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. \n\n**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.\n\n**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments\n\n*Disclaimer : I am not a financial advisor!*",

        "selftext": " \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm).

        "selftext": "So everyday I see a new article on Motley's Fool on why it's bad to buy Gamestop or AMC. The best they had to say so far is to say you might see some winnings but it's dangerous. Today it has literally 4 different articles on why you shouldn't buy any m\u00eame stonks one of them titled 'If you bought Gamestop I have bad news.' . My question now is, what is the new material and research they constantly have that justifies that many articles on the same subject, I mena seriously guys 4 in one day. Even theire other articles have a constant clickbaity character with titles as 'Multiply your money X amounts with this stock.' or why did this stock go up being summarised in that well it went up cause stocks sometimes go up. Always presented with emotionally charged pictures trying to sway unsure people reading their articles. So it's not really a question at the end of the day more like a rant, take it or leave it..",

If so than so be it.. I'm posting this becuse I believe WSB is a strong community and am honored to be apart of it. I've been holding GME and AMC sense last December and personally I'm  not selling, because for me GME and AMC are full of childhood memory's, just like toys r us once was till the shorts got it. So now it will remain just that a memory. Thankfully  GME and AMC are still around to give me the opportunity to take my son to GME for his video games and my daughter to AMC for date night as my parents did for me. This is how memory's are made. To see the wonder and joy in a child's eyes, to hear the change in their voice when asked to go to GME or AMC the excitement these two simple little thing can bring to a child face. Makes holding GME and AMC priceless not matter the cost. I believe in helping other out that is what makes friends. That is how powerful community's are built. I told my friends I'm in and I will tell everyone at WSB I will be taking my earnings from *** limited to but more GME and AMC why some may ask? Well becuse that's how roll.

        "selftext": "Especially the new investors. Second quarter is here and with the economy opening up, the market is about to turn bull. I\u2019ve made a post last time, urging people to be smart with buying AMC and GME, as when the market is green, AMC and GME take big hits. \n\nI was correct. \n\nPeople are just going to comment \u201cYou\u2019re a hedge fund\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re still buying\u201d I\u2019m not here to tell you what you can, can\u2019t, or, should do with your money. However, I\u2019m here to tell you to be a little smart and invest only what you\u2019re willing to lose that\u2019ll not impact you what-so-ever. \n\nThat being said, last thing our economy needs is a recession. \n\nIf you\u2019re truly in it for the cause, then hold by all means. If you can\u2019t handle the hit, smart thing now would be to brace and not keep risking. \n\nWe will probably see a rapid decline in AMC &amp; GME, big sell offs are going to happen as the whales are going to shift their money into the bull market. \n\nQuarter 2 may not be the best for AMC &amp; GME. Although I will receive a lot of hate under this post, I\u2019m just trying to help new investors understand that prices don\u2019t only go up, they go down as well. Last thing I would want to see is people struggling like \u201808. \n\nSo please, don\u2019t let fomo take you over. Be wise and make good decisions. Always remember a quote from warren buffet; \u201cNever lose money.\u201d \n\nCheers &amp; Good luck.",

So why are   they giving up easy tendies and selling hype, or why can't they anymore?\n\nOh, and even though we didn't get to play stonks today, DONT WORRY, the shorts got to play! More at the bottom.\n\n**Intro Material:**\n\n*A    SPAC, Special Acquisition Company, is a way to get a bunch of money  to   take a company public, but it's basically nothing, just a pile of   money  that's looking to buy into a company and behind closed doors,   make an  agreement that gets the company listed.*\n\nSPAC's became a large part of the market since COVID, and banks and funds have been making SHIT TONS off of them.\n\n*\"In 2020, underwriters were the kings of Wall Street.*\n\n*The    biggest investment banks recorded better-than-expected  years, even    though a global pandemic sent shockwaves through businesses  and    households. No business grew more than their operations selling  stocks.    In the spring, clients bracing for economic trouble turned to stock    markets to raise cash.* [*In the latter part of 2020*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline)*,     it was the SPACs\u2014special-purpose acquisition vehicles\u2014that raised     billions of dollars as a quick and suddenly popular way to get more     companies into* [*the public markets\u2019 wide-open arms*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602?mod=article_inline)*.

The surge in SPAC's    can also be said to have helped the recovery from the COVID crash,  and   it looks like they thought it would keep going well into 2021...\n\nBelow    is an ETF of SPACs, and you can see the nice run up until Jerome    Powell announces that the SLR Exception isn't going continue past March:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrmamj77quq61.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b40def2bb79c1e0fd8343459ebc413b199eddd7\n\nPurple Line is Powell Saying SLR Exception Won't Be Extended\n\nI've   seen many posts  commenting how the \"SPAC Crash\" is due to market   rotation, or consumer  cyclicals, or fears of COVID, yada yada. **I obviously don't know what caused it**,    but seems to match up pretty damn good with Banks being told they   don't  get to keep all the capital they'd been holding without following    SLR...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Look and see who all has been underwriting all the SPACS:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bucztsj5quq61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=305a8c3be18395f42d5cfe211b8b866651bafff0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTop 10 Underwriters for 2021\n\n[**https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter**](https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter)\n\nCitigroup, GoldmanSachs, CreditSuisse, MorganStanley, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, JP Morgan....\n\nThere's    86 on that list, and most of them aren't major banks, though Credit   Suisse and Citi have the bulk from 2020, but the others are described as   \"boutique, private  financial investment firms\" and you can call some   of them Hedge Funds,  and you can call some of them Shirley.\n\nDoesn't matter, but these are the players who have been making BANK over the last year... up till now.\n\nSo let's start to look at some of the other firms on that list,...\n\nlike **Oppenheimer** because **he has become death, destroyer of worlds**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/my56u2n9quq61.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142aedec0ff4d751195f926d1709cf2323e1d747\n\nCheck out the Red Box for your own viewing pleasure\n\nNow    let's open up a favorite website of mine that doesn't have the most  up   to date data, but does have a pretty wide range of info on hedge  fund   holdings and shareholders, and you can even check out cashflow: **HedgeFollow**\n\nHere's the top shareholders for Oppenheimer ( just one of the underwriters from the SPAC list)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbhkf0gaquq61.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75f0a105fe629aa28c5e02a8508f1155c028b8ee\n\nhttps://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY\n\nHi Citadel! (Waves)\n\nYea, **there's all sorts of goodies**    in the SPAC underwriters. Most of them are pretty incestuous when it    comes to ownership, with a TON of overlap between them all, many of  them   just kinda own each other, and that one owns the other back...  round   and round.\n\n**Anyway, what the hell's my point?**\n\nSo    we've been told that Bill Hwang blew up Credit Suisse and probably   half  of all the major banks, but it probably deeper than all that...    actually YEA.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Last year, as of Sept 8 2020, Hedge Funds starting to go long on ViacomCBS, not just Billy Hwang.**\n\n[\\[YahooFinanceArticle\\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-viacomcbs-inc-viac-142213772.html)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's    that mean, no idea, but probably all of them doing something with it    selling off stuff after the merger, maybe, who knows..... shitty  guess,  they wanted a fall guy so they use the \"Bad Boy\"\n\n**Speculating won't do us any good though, so let's just look at how some of the banks are doing.**\n\nGoldman Sachs lays out how the chart reads for those apes not familiar with **IBorrowDesk** but it usually has updated info every 15 minutes on available shares for a company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ayzny2ubquq61.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb021b76e2ee0d245e0f570db08d0bd26eebfb5\n\nGoldman Sachs is  getting shorted the last few days.\n\nAs    of now it seems that most of the action is concentrated in the   European  based banks, and we're starting to see them get shorted, some   of them  shorted HARD!!! Bank of America, Wells Fargo didn't show   anything since  the site maxes out at 10M shares available.\n\nThe   Swiss have taken the first hit, media's been focusing on them for the    last few days, and the red arrows show the change in available shorts    TODAY! Good Friday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4yhx1c7equq61.png?width=1171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=214df469ab1493c18862db19fa0ce00da4160ead\n\nLooks   like Thursday HF's bought back shares they shorted CS with, only to   short it again today. BUT, It's still above the average of the last   year.\n\nI would assume that after   the Swiss Bank fell to COVID levels they'd stop shorting, but NOPE!   They're still going at it, granted not AS BAD, but how much lower do   they think it will fall?\n\nThe Germans have been seeing a rounding of shorts for most of March:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prsaroyequq61.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89fc70ffd9722cc5f67ca25522ba3086343c81ff\n\nHF's have been shorting the Germans for most of March.\n\nAnd for those APEs that have read \"The Everything Short\" you're going to love this next one!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhg6hxufquq61.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd27a123753dca48d3bd3fc13ecf1cc926ea4b3\n\nYea, there's only about a handful of shares left for the bonds.\n\n**So what's it all mean.....MMMMAAAANNNNNN.......?**\n\n1. TLT is shorted to hell (Everything Short)\n2. HF's and Banks aren't making the returns from fees and selling SPACS (most of them) like they had in 2020...\n3. OR....    HF's are getting out of SPACsto have to cover shorts for GME or T   Notes  or AMC or .... USE WHICHEVER FLAVOR OF CONFIRMATION BIAS GOES   WELL WITH  YOUR PEEPS!  I sure as hell don't know.\n4. I'm    leanings towards it's not making me want to go out and buy SPY calls,    and maybe April Fools was the SPY hitting FOUR OH OH so that they  could   shoot it over the weekend, but again, I'm posting here, not WSJ.\n\nAs always, don't trust anyone on the internet, call your mother, and none of us are flossing enough.\n\n**Order of Links Used BECAUSE I BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE:**\n\n* [**https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter**](https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter)\n* [https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY)\n* [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/DB)",

My question; at this point, looking at utilization, borrow rates, etc., what makes GME in a better spot right now with the price target it\u2019s at now? Is the short float % in better shape? Is the squeeze ceiling higher due to smaller outstanding shares? I\u2019m not asking in a condescending way.

At what point does it make sense to consider selling the option...it could potentially be ITM as of today, so of course it will increase in value, and will also have the whole time value as well.\n\nObviously, it could go up as well during this week, but what do people usually do in terms of deciding when to take profits/cut losses? I don't want to get too jumpy, because I do feel like it could have a good week, but I'm also a newbie so I'm kind of nervous as well.

Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.\n\nTwo years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT\u2019s market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT\u2019s Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55.\n\n(important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**\n\n# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?\n\nLast year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).\n\nThe good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**\n\nThe original bear argument was centered around $ROOT\u2019s high loss ratios vs.competitors.  However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company\u2019s Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT\u2019s loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages.\n\n# Root 2021 Growth\n\nGrowth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:**\n\n\u201cWe were able to show strong growth despite the decision to pull back on marketing spend towards the end of the first quarter resulting from the global pandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe plan to more than double our sales and marketing investments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investment in marketing fuels an accelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.\u201d\n\nThis step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie).\n\n**Daily Downloads \u2013 ROOT (Green) vs. LMND (Blue)**\n\n[Daily Downloads \u2013 ROOT vs. LMND](https://preview.redd.it/xznvm6vnukq61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff9268c390d6e6ab44fe070c1521b58cd038c288)\n\n# Now for the Most important Part!\n\n**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high. When $GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. Now $ROOT has 47.36% Short interest Float!!!!!**\n\nIn comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL)\n\n# Price Target\n\nWithout factoring the massive short squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**\n\nBUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.\n\n\"This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs. what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago.\" C\\*Tron\n\n**If a full short squeeze happens, In my opinion, this can reach 50$+ short term.**\n\nResources:\n\nA lot of the DD came from C\\*(i)TRON",

        "selftext": "Hello my fellow Apes! It\u2019s your friendly neighbor CrayonEatter (Chris 801). As you know BlackRock has heavily invested in AMC with around 5,926,369 shares. This ranks them as number 3 behind Wanda and Vanguard.  \n\nOk, here is where things get juicy, and yes I mean juicy. Did you know Adam Aron is on multiple boards of directors? Well he is! FYI this is quite common for most CEOs, but I digress. Adam is currently attached to two other boards; Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. I was up late last night, and I was going through Adam Aron\u2019s statement of ownership and it led me through this rabbit hole.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001032673](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001032673) \n\nSo after seeing Adam Aron\u2019s SOO (Statement Of Ownership), it led me to Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which I found out he used to be the CEO of the company, and is now just a board member. When I looked at the Fintel filings on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, I was shocked to see similar institutions holding their shares. Could this just be a coincidence? Both BlackRock and Vanguard are the top institutional investors. \n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/nclh](https://fintel.io/so/us/nclh)\n\nThis gave me the smooth brain ape idea to check on the other board of directors he sits on.  He currently sits on the Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. board. What did I find? The exact same institutions involved with top ownership of the company. I would like to refer to the old saying: \n\nIt happens once it's an occurrence, if it happens twice it\u2019s a coincidence/chance, and three times it\u2019s a trend. Well Blackrock and Vanguard both top institutional investors once again.\n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/glpi](https://fintel.io/so/us/glpi) \n\nWhy is this significant? It's because it shows a trend that BlackRock, Vanguard, and Adam Aron are bullish on one another. This is important because Blackrock believes that Aron is a money maker, and also it shows we don\u2019t have to worry about Blackrock fire selling their shares or doing anything else shady. It also shows they have a true business relationship, and what better way to keep that relationship is to have the mother of all squeezes happen. After the squeeze, BlackRock with all its new tendies can buy a big portion of the upcoming 500 million shares issued by AMC. SO FEAR NOT APES! I can say BlackRock is our friend and ally when it comes to this war with Shitadel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a Financial advisor. This is not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "This might be a little bit of a conspiracy, but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately one why it\u2019s so hard to get this squeeze to happen with AMC, why Hedge funds are fighting so hard with us to let go of the short shares, and why they shorted AMC into oblivion to begin with. It\u2019s a bit of a large stretch here, and all i ask is that you suspend your beliefs for a second to kind of wrap your head around where I\u2019m trying to go with this. \n\nPreface: I\u2019m holding 850 shares of AMC, and I\u2019m holding for the squeeze with all the apes. I believe COVID-19 is real, and is a real problem, to whats extent as time goes on, I\u2019m not really sure. This small thesis I\u2019m providing requires a lot of jumping to conclusions, intuitive leaps, and requires a tinfoil hat. I\u2019m sorry in advance.\n\nSources: \n\nYouTube: \n\nDisney is going to kill the movie theaters- Screen rant\nFilm theory: why your favorite movie theater won\u2019t survive 2020- the film theorists\n\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking: \n\nBefore the pandemic Disney started acquiring major media companies like Star Wars, industrial light and magic, Hulu, 20th century fox, and others. As they started doing this things, they hiked the prices and fees up to show movies at theaters, and started locking other movies up in their vaults preventing them from being seen at all.\n\nAs we all know, in the international markets China is the number one income sources for films overseas. Disney has notoriously edited films to all hell, met outrageous demands, and done things specifically for the Chinese markets just to keep making money for them.\n\nOut of nowhere, the COVID-19 virus shows up, from China, and shuts down the entire country.\n\nThe SLR rule is put into place. Hedge funds can leverage positions with near infinite amounts of money. \n\nHedge funds Target AMC and try to short it into bankruptcy. \n\nWhy? \n\nThinking about Disney\u2019s plans to get movie theater restrictions increased and leveraging streaming services online for a more steady and long-term income source to provide the house of mouse with infinite liquidity, it makes sense to me. Disney privately funded the Short on AMC to close down the movie theater industry in almost it\u2019s entirety in order to force people to sit home and buy subscriptions to their streaming services. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say that Disney orchestrated COVID-19, released it into the world, to shut down movies, to force people to stay home and buy movie subscriptions, but it makes sense.\n\nAnd thats why it\u2019s so hard to squeeze AMC. Because fucking Mickey Mouse wants AMC to go bankrupt and shut all it\u2019s doors forever so they can make the most money in the long wrong. They stand to make the most money. Forever.\n\nAnd then we showed up. And fucked up the entire plan. \n\nIv\u2019e been thinking about it for a little while. Over a year now. Since the YouTube videos came out and I\u2019ve been doing nothing during the pandemic except buying and holding. \n\n\nTLDR: Mickey Mouse is trying to bankrupt AMC to force people to buy Disney+ subscriptions.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

        "selftext": "For reference, I have already stated my bull thesis on AMC to be a recovery play. This merely a theory and I wanted to get some opinions.\n\nThis is the theory I had...\n\nIf Disney were to acquire AMC, it could reasonably wipe out the existing debt at the start and be making $1B+ in net profit each year from the acquisition alone once Covid ends. The reason why I say it\u2019s the holy trinity of acquisitions is you have a company that would have a proven streaming service, production of the some of the highest grossing movies, and then you add theater\u2019s to the mix. \n\nWhat would this mean for all other theater companies? It would be the end of all of them because Disney alone would command viewers by releasing their productions in their theaters first.\n\nIf Disney acquired the biggest theater company in the world, AMC, it would shatter the theater industry leaving only Disney remaining. Let\u2019s say Disney also could improve profit margins on snacks and drinks and raise net profits due to having better existing connections to snack and candy manufacturers respectively.\n\nWhat gives? Why would Disney do that? They could purchase AMC for less than what it\u2019s worth because of their debt. It would likely not bode well for current AMC investors, but it could go either way in terms of a valuation. It could benefit some and not others based on price entry points. Or it may drive the current stock price of AMC into overdrive considering what this deal means which is that Disney, being a movie producer, can now also own theaters based on the removal of the Paramount Consent Decree last year. This means a legal monopoly on theaters if studio companies like Disney, HBO, or Amazon decided to throw their weight around.\n\nPlus as of April, 2021 there is also some news articles coming out about dissenting theater companies not wanting to play Disney movies in their theaters due to unfavorable contractual conditions. \n\n\u201cWe haven't made any threats,\" AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Adam Aron said in reference to \"Black Widow.\" But \"it is widely known that AMC has threatened not to play movies if we could not find business terms that we found acceptable,\" he said.\n\nHowever it is my belief that not one existing theater would be able to compete with the likes and funding of Disney if they decided to acquire AMC unless other theater companies too found a studio production company to buy them out.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHi everyone,\n\nFirst time poster and just started trading options a couple weeks ago. Ive been stock trading for a while and figured it was time to give options a go as i could see the benefit of paying premiums as opposed to tying up my whole portfolio.\n\nLast week i had purchased some options, these particular ones were:\n\nNLS 5/21 puts with a strike of $15 @ 1.31\n\nNLS 5/21 puts with a strike of 12.550 at 1.13\n\nsA couple days after i bought them i was up about 40% on them and sold them a day or two later to lock in some profit. i was not ITM (i think it briefly dipped into the money) when i sold but saw some pretty steep profit with minimal price movement.\n\nFast forward to this week and i boughht some of the following:\n\nAMC 4/16 puts with a strike of 10 @ 1.13.\n\nAMC 4/16 puts with strike of 9.50 @ 1.10\n\nNow these AMC puts went negative like 50% within a day or two. The first question is why would they swing so quickly into the negative with still so many days out. I would assume its because AMC went up a bit the days following but it wasnt very much , definitely less than $1 on the stock price.\n\nSecondly, the offering gave a huge sell off that put me into the money on both of the puts but they are still showing negative. Now i know that i lose value on my options in time, but these were bought on 3/25, so about a week now with still another 2 weeks left. Why did they decay so fast? im looking at the volitility to explain the deep loss even now that im ITM and i would assume that i overpaid because of the IV?\n\nif my NLS was quickly profitable with little movement, did i mess up by buying so close to expiry? was it simply overpaying on a premium ? when i started this i day traded some F option for 1 contract and i was up like 30% very quickly with minimal price movement. Im exploring and learning greeks to see if there is a component that made this trade such a bad one or rather, so hard to become profitiable while the others were profitable without even getting into the money so much.\n\nGood luck to everyone!",

        "selftext": "My brain just wrinkled thinking about the AMC situation.\nTell me if Im wrong.\n\n1. Voting yes means more shares, which means a count for actual viable shares, which is a good thing, right?\n2. Voting yes means share dilution, which in the immediate sense means a price drop, but can also act as a buying opportunity because fire sale.\n3. That fire sale could be bought up by current apes, new smoothbrains who couldn't afford to buy in until now, or by banks. Outcome unknown, but Im guessing apes will buy en masse.\n4. Increasing shares is a way for the company to build wealth, is it not? It just becomes a long terrm play for the real diamond-handers instead of a short-term play. \n5. So theoretically, if you vote Yes, you really like the stock and care about the company...and if you vote No, youre just worried about your bag right now, and not in the long term?\n6. If they do issue shares and you're holding, but buy more once the price drops, you could theoretically make up what you lost during dilution in the long term.\n7. Also, let's not kid ourselves, if they issue shares and price dilution happens, a lot of paperhanders will sell only to buy again after the price hits the dilution low, possibly creating another opportunity?\n\nNone of this is advice, I just like the company and the stock.",

This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR. \n\nIf you want to do a deep dive on $ROOT, yesterday u/faisall1 posted a good DD on $ROOT. [Link to DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhcq0v/root_the_next_moon_landing/)\n\n1- It has a rare Short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). In addition, only 75,000 are available for shorting(2021-04-01 11:33:46.728 UTC). To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. We have 47.36%!!! so a **short squeeze** is inevitable? \n\n **In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL).**\n\n2-  Forget about the short squeeze... It also has a potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is high above 15$ relative to Float. Once it hits and stays above $15, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**. \n\n3- $ROOT is massively undervalued, **without factoring in the Gamma and Short squeeze potential(especially with low float and low valuation 3.2B reminds me of early days of $GME)**, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**\n\nBUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.\n\n4- For 2021 Growth Potential, There is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads which started in February based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie)(Illustrated in the chart in u/faisall1's post).

[https://youtu.be/b1HrFGwPweA](https://youtu.be/b1HrFGwPweA)\n\n**DTC- 2021-005 Proposed Rule Change**\n\nFirst off, if you don\u2019t already know the Depository Trust Company (DTC) is one of the largest securities depositories in the world and also acts as a clearinghouse to process and settle trades in corporate and municipal securities. The DTC holds eligible securities on behalf of Participants and its activities include transfers and pledges of securities, and the settlement of transactions for Participants by book-entry, free of payment or delivery versus payment. Now that is cleared up so lets begin\u2026\n\nDTC-2021-005 proposes a modification of the DTC Settlement Guide and the DTC Pledgee\u2019s Agreement available here\u2026 [https://www.dtcc.com/legal/rules-and-procedures](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/rules-and-procedures) \n\nThis settlement guide along with all the other guides found on the DTC website put the DTC\u2019s rules and regulations into normal ape English as best they can to help understand what they mean and how they work.\n\nThe very first note of this specific guide states that:\n\n\u201cIt is the sole responsibility of **Participants** to perform a daily reconciliation of their activity and positions with the information, reports and statements provided by DTC. Participants must immediately report to DTC any discrepancy between their activity and positions with the information, reports and statements provided by DTC or other issues relating to the accuracy of the information, reports and statements provided by DTC\u201d \n\nParticipants are clearly the liable party here so let\u2019s first understand who they are before we dive any further. \n\nRule 1 of the DTC By-Laws tells us this: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dk010xma2ur61.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e08891f1c5ba3892efa57b07415ec27277ade10b\n\nPretty vague so let\u2019s go to Section 1 of Rule 2, but keep in mind that any time you see the word Corporation its mean the DTC:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jw3f9fsb2ur61.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65b5d8ae0cef8b1d7ba3c7d973653faccc5bb273\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aek47t9c2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e901c46a381a56420c12d3ad7127869accbc8760\n\nSo essentially a DTC Participant can be brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations on whose behalf DTC was created to hold securities to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among DTC Participants.\n\n**Guess who is a DTC Participant?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgngmbod2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=551a75e0ad1719f602b0a6b8dd79952f459f868f\n\nIf you guessed Citadel, you would be right! Ok so let\u2019s look at the proposed change now\u2026\n\nAccording to the formal document submitted on April 1st, 2021, \u201cthe proposed rule change would revise text in the Settlement Guide and Pledgee\u2019s Agreement to clarify the text with respect to the processing of book entries of Pledge-related activity at DTC.\u201d Go here to read for yourself:\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=dtcc+rule+005&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB\\_enUS939US939&amp;oq=dtcc+rule+005&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3432j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=dtcc+rule+005&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS939US939&amp;oq=dtcc+rule+005&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3432j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)\n\nAccording to Rule 1, the term \u201cPledge\u201d refers to \u201ccreating or providing for a security interest in a **certified or uncertified security**, a securities account, or securities entitlement in accordance with the NYUCC\u201d. The NYUCC being the Uniform Commercial Code of NY. A certified security is a security represented by certificate, which means an uncertified security has no certificate. Securities are banknotes, bonds, common stocks, options as well as many other forms. A securities account has two means, as follows: \n\n1) \u201cused with respect to a Participant or Pledgee, means an account maintained by DTC for the Participant or Pledgee to which Securities transactions of the Participant or Pledgee effected through the facilities of DTC are debited and credited in the manner specified in the Rules and Procedures\u201d \n\n2)\u201d used with respect to DTC, means an internal account of DTC to which Securities transactions are debited and credited to DTC.\u201d \n\nThe proposed revisions would reflect in the text of the Settlement Guide and Pledgee\u2019s Agreement that Pledged Securities remain credited to a Pledgor\u2019s Account unless the Pledgee makes a demand for the Pledged Securities. The respective texts of the Settlement Guide and the Pledgee\u2019s Agreement currently indicate that Pledged Securities are credited to a Pledgee\u2019s Account. The proposed rule change relates to a technical aspect of the operational processing of Pledge transactions and would not impact the rights or obligations of a Participant or Pledgee. \n\nEnglish, man, English!!!! Sorry, this means that the DTC or a pledgee approved by the DTC may demand a participant deliver the securities they pledged to deliver. This theoretically would eliminate FTDs, Failure-to-Delivers. \n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWait! I thought the other Rule change did this? Patience grasshopper, the best is yet to come!\n\nHere are the physical changes taking place in the Settlement Guide, which offers some icing to this cake: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tojo3wtf2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c211e556be3491256730d2d7a3fba529e03681c\n\nTherefore, in the DTC\u2019s system all securities will remain accounted for at all times, which eliminates the possibility to naked short! This is what has been plaguing us in the market for as long as the market has existed. This of course has its pros and cons! The procon sandwich here is that because no more naked shorting will be able to take place, provided a loophole isn\u2019t quickly found, there will never been a squeeze like the ones we will see in the near future with the highly shorted stocks we know in love, Namely GME and AMC, just to name two! Therefore, is it unlikely we will take those HF managers Gucci ties and place them around our heads while we stand on top of the nearest tall object we can find and pound on our chests until we are badly bruised! However, maybe this will prevent the market from suffering severe crashes in the future, the purposeful bankrupting of companies, and the intense market manipulation we have seen of late.\n\nThe big potential con of course lies in the details of Rule 2 Section 2 &amp; 3: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwrq0wfh2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ce0b7c5a50d27ba6c2bfecf70be08797023e14\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clu3nyuh2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab1e3c6894b34d4ca7277c2da113d95bfea5b34\n\nHence, Citadel having the approval to be a DTC participant we two separate accounts as I mentioned previously could mean that Citadel A acts as a Pledgee for Citadel B the Participant and nothing changes except some words on a piece of paper. It seems like the DTC would still have the numbers in their system and not allow the pledged securities be repledged, but if that\u2019s not the case Citadel A may just lie and say, \u201cOh yea, they are alllllll accounted for!\u201d\n\nNevertheless, if this does pass remember Rule 27: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/addv67vi2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b8453c57a55fca372fbb1c908ef1e8cebe659f7\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping all ends well for us Apes!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/em71yd1k2ur61.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fb790977e173c4ceaf27926bbd5528534f9d621",

        "selftext": "For everyone who thinks all short-selling is bad, consider how strong the conviction must be for a fund to take an unhedged short position after GME and other squeezing bankrupted \"Smart Money.\" Strategies that involved using leverage to take on risk far greater than could be justified by any gains resulted in losses far above the threshold any reasonable asset manager should allow. There is a reason why taking short positions, has more than purely negative implications for the markets. Before you get mad, let me explain how it can actually can contribute to healthy markets. More importantly, I will talk about how limiting buy orders is far more destructive to shareholders.\n\nA company can take short positions in a number of ways. Many of which are new and now accessible to retail investors. Prior, high borrowing fees and barriers to entry made it only feasible for funds with with a significant AUM and open mandate. Now we have:\n\nInverse leveraged ETF's offering a low opportunity cost way of managing drawdowns and protecting investors with long positions during periods of large and lasting declines.\nIt can give retail investors a chance to make gains during a bear market. Rather than leaving only short sellers to profit, it can help contribute to the rebound and to the long term accumulation of wealth by new and small investors. These gains will likely be redistributed to those who need them the most or reallocated to sectors more deserving of capital based on the FREE MARKET.\n\nOptions, primarily buying puts allows for a set amount to be allocated to stocks or securities that could drop, but have a high chance of appreciating in value enough to offset the limited loss caused by the put expiring useless. Without any way of preventing rapid price declines from causing shareholders to sell more, and more, the innovation, new companies and higher risk plays would become impossible as the cost of margin (or clients with new money) required to stick it out prevents a buy and hold alternative.\n\nFor example, since I purchased Canadian and U.S. energy stocks during their lowest points: I have been able to hold those positions as they appreciate in value by almost 100% or more because I know that I can buy puts without costing much money as they expire and I repurchase OTM contracts at regular intervals to save my portfolio from a Blackswan event like 08 or increase my returns when an event like Covid-19. I may not have the 20X gains some investors have earned this year, but at least I know how much my loss could amount to if a meltdown occurs.\n\nThe F strategy is easy to follow and would have prevented situations like GME and many other times where funds blow up overnight. Forget shorting any of the:\n\nFrauds: If you are taking on a short position because you think a company is being fraudulent, you risk being right but still taking a big L because the company did something fraudulent, illegal or questionable to cover up the same reason to short in the first place. \"Fake it till you make it\" has been used by companies backed into a corner and forced to produce results or go under. We have seen banks and fortune 500 companies committing fraud or crimes because the penalties are negligible and the rewards are great.\n\nFailures: Shorting a failing company can and many times IS asking for trouble because changes in events, new information, technological breakthroughs and cheap debt can give the failing company a chance to pivot and very quickly reverse a trend even after it appears impossible. For example: AR is an energy company in the US that had to deal with low commodity prices, an oversupply of domestic and international crude as well as high borrowing costs. It had a 25+% short interest as it hovered around bankruptcy and dropped below a dollar per share during the worst of the pandemic. Rising oil prices then gas prices, and very low borrowing costs allowed for the struggling company to refinance, cut costs, face less competition and pay down high cost debt. No longer a failing company, many believed despite its massive free cashflow and huge reserves it will drop following a short lived rally thanks to a regime change and aggressive climate policies. Wrong. They shorted it up to $7, with 16% of the float still accumulating losses as of Jan 15.\n\nFads: My last F is particularly interesting right now because of the record levels of short interest in stocks like TSLA and AMC. During a period of intense buying and high rates of participation from the overall marketplace, the potential for price action driven by sentiment alone has never been higher. The time horizon and risk appetite for the AVERAGE investor (very different from a few years ago) combined with access to information faster, cheaper and easily manipulated information can lead to irrational (or rational depending on how you view it) price appreciation in companies that should otherwise have no reason to be rising. Disruptive technology, the FOMOGROMO effect (how I describe the fear of missing out on rapid growth perpetuated by rapid growth) and central banks changing their behaviours. The old saying \"The markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent is so relevant.\" Fads can also become the norm, and by assuming the vacuum created by the disappearance of a trend/fad will cause your short position to pay of and produce a quick gain: you will be surprised to see the emergence of structural changes cementing the fad into long-term patterns of behaviour initially thought to be impossible or very unlikely. For example, at the height of the pandemic, equities such as the IEF (a fixed income 10-year bond etf) rose to record highs as the flight to safety and market turmoil caused a massive demand for low risk, highly liquid fixed income ETFs. Further supported by the Fed buying assets like they are going out of style in fear of a deep recession following the lockdown. After the vaccine showed effectiveness and the economy began returning back to normal, I purchased a very small number of puts that would pay out substantially if nothing happened and more if the economy showed a strong recovery. This should be especially true with rising inflationary pressure. It was not a FAD, the Fed is apparently going to keep buying these assets until the M2 supply hits GME/TSLA levels. (Both two of the most shorted stocks return the highest gains this year.)",
