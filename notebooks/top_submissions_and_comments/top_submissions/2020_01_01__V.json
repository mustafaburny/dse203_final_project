        "selftext": "Hello WSB - [as some of you may know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJgF_tqtGEs), I've been working on a book for quite some time.  I'm happy to announce that it's finished and available on Amazon.  Currently it's only on Kindle but it will be available on print as well within 72 hours:\n\n[LINK TO AMAZON](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084CZKCSP/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=wallstreetbets&amp;qid=1580421607&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1)\n\nThe book basically blames grown ups for creating such a fun, massive, and legal casino where everyone can play.  And of course, the entire book is accompanied by stories from all of you throughout the years.  Some of which you probably remember and some of which you may not.   \n\nI wanted to share a PDF with you to include a free sample but the Terms of Service explicitly prohibit this, however you can read the first chapter or two for free right from the amazon store.  I encourage you to do so.\n\nu/haupt91 got a chance to read it and had this to say:\n\n&gt; I'm a little over half way through. I gotta tell you dude. I don't bullshit and I'm not gonna kiss your ass - but this is fucking great. The Jesse Livermore quote, the way the book is structured. The story-telling component in the beginning and the angle. It's really fucking good. I hope you release it right and have a gameplan.",

Just opened a Roth IRA, looking to get the most bang for my buck for the next 25+ years with this account. \n\nI have two simple strategies I am considering employing. I'm thinking about either investing only in one mutual fund and/or total market ETF and 1-3 individual stocks that would only make up 10-20% of my portfolio(V, MSFT and AAPL most likely). My other strategy would be investing in 10-20 blue chip stocks with with high revenue, low debt and decent dividend payouts (WFC, MO, CCI for example). What strategy is best for very long term growth? \n\nIn regards to the first strategy, if I'm going very long in a Roth IRA wouldnt a mutual fund be better than an ETF? Should I do one or both?\n\nIn regards to the second strategy, since Roth IRA isnt taxed, does it make more sense to go after blue chip dividend stocks or growth stocks?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have just started a python for finance Youtube series where I share how I have created programs to scan stocks, back test strategies, and manage your portfolio.\n\nEven if you have never programmed python is easy to learn and a great skill to have!\n\nSo far I have made 2 videos, the first is a walk-through of how to download python and then how to access and manipulate stock data to create simple moving averages\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myFD0np9eys&amp;list=PLPfme2mwsQ1FQhH1icKEfiYdLSUHE-Wo5&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myFD0np9eys&amp;list=PLPfme2mwsQ1FQhH1icKEfiYdLSUHE-Wo5&amp;index=2&amp;t=4s)\n\nThe second video teaches you how to back test strategies. The program simulates entering and exiting trades based on criteria you choose (such as a close above or below a moving average) Then it calculates key statistics that identify how effective that trading method is including batting average and total return.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYK2SNygAog&amp;list=PLPfme2mwsQ1FQhH1icKEfiYdLSUHE-Wo5&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYK2SNygAog&amp;list=PLPfme2mwsQ1FQhH1icKEfiYdLSUHE-Wo5&amp;index=3&amp;t=2s)\n\nPlease check it out and any feedback about what python videos I should make or how I can improve these videos is welcome!

        "selftext": "Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.\n\nFounded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988.\n\nWith an average net return of 39.1% after fees.\n\nThe Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.\n\nSince, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.\n\nNow, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).\n\nMedallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.\n\nNotice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.\n\nIn 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%\n\n**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.\n\nThat certainly beats inflation...\n\nSo, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART 1: The Early Stages**\n\nEarly on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.\n\nRemember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,\u201d Simons said. \u201cA pure system without humans interfering.\u201d\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus\u2019 was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&amp;P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator\u2019s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman\u2019s calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\n\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\n\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\n\nThe mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**\n\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBRAVE BROWSER: [https://brave.com/fin894](https://brave.com/fin894)",

        "selftext": "Yogi Berra was quoted as saying that \u201cit\u2019s tough making predictions, especially about the future.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are times when one is able to at least obtain a probabilistic reading about the future, based upon an understanding of mass human sentiment and human psychology.\n\nIn fact, back in the 1940\u2019s, an accountant named Ralph Nelson Elliott identified behavioral patterns within the stock market which represented the larger collective behavioral patterns of society en masse. And, in 1940, Elliott publicly tied the movements of human behavior to the natural law represented through Fibonacci mathematics.\u00a0\n\nElliott understood that financial markets provide us with a representation of the overall mood or psychology of the masses.\u00a0 And, he also understood that markets are fractal in nature.\u00a0 That means they are variably self-similar at different degrees of trend.\n\nMost specifically, Elliott theorized that public sentiment and mass psychology move in 5 waves within a primary trend, and 3 waves within a counter-trend.\u00a0 Once a 5 wave move in public sentiment has completed, then it is time for the subconscious sentiment of the public to shift in the opposite direction, which is simply the natural cycle within the human psyche, and not the operative effect of some form of \u201cnews.\u201d\n\nThis mass form of progression and regression seems to be hard wired deep within the psyche of all living creatures, and that is what we have come to know today as the \u201cherding principle,\u201d which gives this theory its ultimate power.\n\nAnd, over the last 30 years, many social experiments have been conducted throughout the world which have provided scientific support to Elliott\u2019s theories presented almost a century ago.\u00a0\n\nBut, even before these more recent studies have begun to support Elliott\u2019s understanding of the market set forth 80 years ago, Elliott provided us with an extraordinarily bold stock market prediction.\u00a0 Allow me to present you with the following prediction made by Ralph Nelson Elliott in August of 1941:\n\n*\\[1941\\] should mark the final correction of the 13 year pattern of defeatism. This termination will also mark the beginning of a new Supercylce wave (V), comparable in many respects with the long \\[advance\\] from 1857 to 1929. Supercycle (V) is not expected to culminate until about 2012.*\n\nFor those of you that do not understand this quote, Elliott was predicting the start of a 70-year bull market in the face of World War II raging around him.\u00a0 Quite an amazing prediction, no?\n\nNow, the rally that Elliott was predicting seems to have gone well beyond his expectations from a timing standpoint.\u00a0 In fact, if we follow through with Elliott\u2019s original assessments, and we take into account the actual structure we have seen over the last 70 years, I believe the rally he was forecasting will last considerably longer than his expectations, especially when we now can fill in the wave structure of the rally he expected.\u00a0 You can see what I am speaking of on the attached chart compiled by Garrett Patten of Elliottwavetrader.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 [https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/images/charts/202001/full-218eaee8c1261adf0336cb12c5c5c7ae2a163675.png](https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/images/charts/202001/full-218eaee8c1261adf0336cb12c5c5c7ae2a163675.png)\n\nSpecifically, what it tells us is that the market could very well be in the final stage of a multi-year rally, which in my work has an ideal target in the 4000 region.\u00a0 \u00a0But, as you can see from this much longer-term perspective chart, it even has potential to rise as high as the 6000 region in a blow off top.\u00a0 (I will have a much better idea of that topping target within the next year or so).\n\nYet, the main take away for those investing over the coming decade is that we are likely approaching a point in time where the market can enter into a multi-decade \u201ccorrection\u201d in wave \\[IV\\], as outlined on the chart above. \u00a0While that would likely be the next generational buying opportunity, it seems to suggest that the last half of the upcoming decade will result in a lot of pain for investors.\n\nAt a minimum, I would expect the next bear market would have us revisit the 1800SPX region in the second half of the new decade.\u00a0 So, enjoy the profits of this \u201clast hurrah\u201d over the coming several years, as we are likely setting up for a once in a century event, which can rival the Great Depression, as it is of the same long-term wave degree.\u00a0 Remember, while history does not exactly repeat, it certainly does rhyme.\u00a0 And, those that are unwilling to learn from history are certainly bound to repeat it. \u00a0",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.\n\n# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December\u2019s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday\u2019s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatic,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cNonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter\u2019s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday\u2019s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. \u201cI think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday\u2019s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he\u2019s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM\u2019s strike. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,\u201d he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aoDnUW7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6x4NtiW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZNEuH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3Ltxt2.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CyHtJoF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RO92K5i.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SEszd5M.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tlPjW9c.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aicevVU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years\n\n&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a79e9eb21df6d414fd0ec1c7725b4d/e48bbc4e7f5b7041-e9/s500x750/6a964dc4a15e1c9ab0fcc9ccc451f6e642aacff5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Banner Year for US Equities\n\n&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile-rolling.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow\n\n&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.\n\n&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns\n\n&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.\n\n&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.\n\n&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).\n\n&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/assetclass1231.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years\n\n&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.\n\n&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/891a38b2171ab08b547127db29f12536/f4d2c822df56176c-4f/s400x600/8f8fe64b2da5c123c7e073095dd8b656e1066429.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 3rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqDWuo8kiFU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.5.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wTk5RDVRtE))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$CALM** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$KRUS** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SLP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lNG07hG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Y1KO0R4.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNOQOhD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QorVd8K.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xTrYEcQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.2 0Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TRPytQz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/owUNbSh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RXUjAgC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/m5AQPKl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/v60Cw2n.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $229.38\n&gt; **lululemon athletica inc.

        "selftext": "Here's an analysis of $TSLA currently vs. $NFLX when it peaked in June 2018 at $423. Below are the 21 greatest daily gains during each stocks bull market run from bottom to top. \n\nThese are called \"climactic tops\" - when euphoria sets in after a good run in a stock, the stock begins to trade on greater volume (highlighted in red text), gap up often, and experience significant daily gains (highlighted orange). Significant gains towards the end of a run are not healthy and indicate speculation. Healthy bull runs experience the biggest gains at the beginning and the gains should remain stable or fade over time, not increase.\n\n[TSLA today vs. NFLX peak Jun'18](https://preview.redd.it/d5xba8dyyma41.png?width=2219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6be2aecb91bd19f3e93df715bc71cc52163cb18d)\n\nI learned this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0APWyNU_lbo). If tomorrow TSLA gaps up (currently +1% after hours), reaches a new intraday high (if it gaps up it will given that it closed at ATH), and then closes the day down (wait until the final 10 mins of trading to confirm) you can expect the top to likely be in. This is exactly what happened to NFLX. I will be shorting TSLA on whenever the next down day is - gap up, gap down, whatever idgaf as long as it has a red daily candle - with a SL just above the intraday ATH. \n\nIn terms of downside targets? After it's peak, NFLX steadly declined about 22.9% within 2 months, and 40% within 6 months  (although this was Q4 2018 so may not be a reliable). It's reasonable to expect we could see a similar \\~23% drop in TSLA too over a similar timeframe atleast. However TSLA has had a far more aggressive climax than NFLX, and is far more volatile/sentiment based, as such I believe that a 30% decline is likely, and in a shorter timeframe, after that perhaps even a 40%-50% overall decline, peak to trough.   \n\nOptions are expensive for $TSLA. $520 March Puts are $45 bucks so your breakeven would be $475 (-9%). Results for long these puts: 25% decline ($375) returns 180%, a 40% decline returns 362%. Perhaps you could sell calls? I'll leave option strategy to you it's not my area.\n\nHope you found this useful. I'll return at the end of this week and see how it played out.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.\n\n# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December\u2019s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday\u2019s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatic,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cNonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter\u2019s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday\u2019s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. \u201cI think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday\u2019s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he\u2019s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM\u2019s strike. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,\u201d he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aoDnUW7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6x4NtiW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZNEuH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3Ltxt2.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CyHtJoF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RO92K5i.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SEszd5M.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tlPjW9c.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aicevVU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years\n\n&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a79e9eb21df6d414fd0ec1c7725b4d/e48bbc4e7f5b7041-e9/s500x750/6a964dc4a15e1c9ab0fcc9ccc451f6e642aacff5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Banner Year for US Equities\n\n&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile-rolling.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow\n\n&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.\n\n&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns\n\n&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.\n\n&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.\n\n&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).\n\n&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/assetclass1231.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years\n\n&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.\n\n&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/891a38b2171ab08b547127db29f12536/f4d2c822df56176c-4f/s400x600/8f8fe64b2da5c123c7e073095dd8b656e1066429.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 3rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.5.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$CALM** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$KRUS** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SLP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lNG07hG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Y1KO0R4.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNOQOhD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QorVd8K.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xTrYEcQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.2 0Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TRPytQz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/owUNbSh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RXUjAgC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/m5AQPKl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/v60Cw2n.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $229.38\n&gt; **lululemon athletica inc.

        "selftext": "I was watching this video explain the difference between a credit spread and a call/put diagonal spreads. I wanted to double check with you my understanding of this and what your thoughts are and if you trade them with any success.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvf425HYfAc\n\n- Isn't he right? There is a positive expectation of profit with diagonals spreads vs credit spreads?\n\n- Also isn't having a gradual curve past the break even point better than the immediate loss with credit spreads?\n\n- Isn't a higher break even price already a plus here? more breathing room, more room for standard deviation.\n\n- Finally, the curving profit curve yield greater profits past the flat lining of the credit spread curve? Is this not the biggest allure of diagonals?\n\nSo my question is why is there so much infatuation with credit spreads but not diagonal spreads? Are you doing it and what is your performance like?\n\nMy focus on credit spreads really began it seems like printing money with the monetary policy being how much an asset moves between quite a large range (assuming an underlying asset without volatility) while keeping losses capped. \n\nThe reason why I see this as a profitable strategy is because of the positive expectation, large breathing room for price fluctuations, larger profit potential, some dynamic loss control.",

        "selftext": "\nIt might be a crowded trade, but the stock is still cheap, relative to the online retailer\u2019s free cash flow.\n\n\u201cBuy Amazon\u201d isn\u2019t the world\u2019s biggest stock-picking clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s close. There are 49 analysts who cover the shares, and 47 of them are positive, with two neutral, according to FactSet. Only Alibaba Group Holding of China and ICICI Bank of India boast more endorsements.\n\nAnd after a record-setting run-up, Amazon\u2019s stock isn\u2019t obviously inviting. A $1,000 stake at the close of the stock\u2019s first day of trading in 1997 has turned into more than $950,000. The shares today, at $1,875, go for 69 times projected 2020 earnings.\n\nStill, buy Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN). The stock price looks sensible when compared with free cash flow, which is swelling quickly. Some growth initiatives are only now paying off. Don\u2019t expect a 35% gain this year, as Amazon has averaged, compounded, since going public. But don\u2019t rule it out, either.\n\nAmazon\u2019s reputation for operating near break-even has long been outdated. Founder Jeff Bezos has emphasized free cash flow over accounting earnings from the start, and Amazon has generated free cash since 2002. The company has tended to invest much of that cash for growth, and the result is that earnings have been positive only since 2014, and only meaningfully so since 2018. Now the numbers are reaching escape velocity.\n\nWhen 2019\u2019s results are released, Wall Street expects Amazon to report that revenue increased by 20%, to $279.1 billion; that earnings rose slightly, to $10.4 billion; and that free cash flow ballooned by 28%, to $24.9 billion. In 2020, free cash flow is expected to expand even faster, by 36%, to $34 billion.\n\nWithin five years, the consensus view is that Amazon will become the biggest free cash generator in America, passing some companies that aren\u2019t exactly standing still, like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The simplest reason is that Amazon\u2019s investment spending can\u2019t keep up with its growth rate forever.\n\nAmazon launched Prime in 2005, with its free two-day shipping for members, and vast opportunities for the company to put capital to work building speedier infrastructure. Not long after, Amazon Web Services went into cloud computing, another path for investment. Both ventures have proved to be lucrative, with Prime spurring increased spending by shoppers, and AWS yielding generous profit margins.\n\nLast year, Amazon said that it would spend to shorten free Prime shipping to a single day. There are early signs of that paying off, too. Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates that Prime membership grew 13% during the fourth quarter, versus a year earlier. That compares with 3% growth a year ago and would be the third straight quarter of acceleration.\n\nNow, consider another of Amazon\u2019s growth initiatives: advertising. A recent search for \u201cmen\u2019s tennis rackets\u201d on Amazon.com yielded editorial recommendations and a racket listing labeled \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice.\u201d But nothing was more prominently displayed than the three sponsored racket listings near the top\u2014except for the paid ad for portable nets just above them.\n\nAdvertising doesn\u2019t require vast investments in fleets and data farms, and it looks like another boon for Amazon\u2019s growth. Ad revenue will rise 36%, to $17.6 billion, in 2020, and by 2025 will top $46 billion, predicts Cowen\u2019s Blackledge. Assuming a 35% operating margin for the business, he estimates that advertising and AWS will together account for 90% of operating income this year.\n\nThat has important implications for shareholders. First, it bodes well for the competitiveness of a store when it doesn\u2019t have to rely on its retail margins for the bulk of profits. Second, the advertising ramp provides another rich source of funds to invest in growth. Third, with Amazon passing the anniversary of its spending boost for Prime one-day, it is unclear that it will need that extra spending. As things stand, growth in capital expenditures is expected to decelerate from over 25% last year, to 16% this year, to under 10% in 2021.\n\nAmong 10 analysts who have estimated Amazon\u2019s free cash flow out to 2021, the lowest says $32.7 billion, the highest says $57.5 billion, and the average is $43.7 billion. Out to 2024, there are only three estimates, averaging $82.8 billion. Apple, in comparison, is expected to produce close to $63 billion in free cash during its current fiscal year through September.\n\nIf distant estimates for Amazon are feasible, or even if they are only moderately overblown, the stock could continue outperforming. At less than 30 times estimated 2020 free cash flow, it is cheaper than the shares of Visa (V), Nike (NKE), or McDonald\u2019s (MCD). From here, 20% annual gains for the next three years could leave the stock priced at a humbler 25 times free cash flow.\n\nA government crackdown against powerful tech titans is a risk, but Amazon may have a better \u201cwho me?\u201d defense than some of the others. Its market share in the public cloud is less than half, and falling, as Microsoft and others catch up. In e-commerce, more than half of its sales are from third-party merchants who pay to use its services. And in online advertising, it\u2019s a pipsqueak next to Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).\n\nAll told, Amazon is popular with stockpickers for good reason. It\u2019s not too late to join the crowd.\n\nSource: Barron's",

([https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/anbr7e/first\\_year\\_into\\_stocks\\_summary\\_all\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/anbr7e/first_year_into_stocks_summary_all_tech/)). I still follow buy and hold strategy and only sell stocks when I don't like certain changes in a company. Sometimes those decisions paid off, sometimes (AAPL) I missed out a bit (nevertheless I don't regret those decisions). \n\nAt some point I was down 30-50% on both NVDA and TSLA, I do strongly believe in both those companies and will not sell either of them in the next 5y for sure. Hitting a bigger number on the portfolio I started diversifying a bit as well. (MA,V,MRK)\n\nStrategy for 2020 is pretty simple for me, I'll invest mostly in AI and cybersececurity companies: First priority is to add a ton of Tencent. Highly recommend the book: \"AI Superpowers Book by Kai-Fu Lee\". imo there is no way around AI and probably Asia will be in the driving seat for the first time in 5-10y.\n\n**Be patient, don't panic sell, it might be swingy here and there but if you invest in strong companies it will pay off.** \n\nCurrent portfolio:\n\n* TSLA +56%\n* CRM +46%\n* FTNT +37%\n* MSFT +35%\n* AMZN +31%\n* MRK +9%\n* MA + 9%\n* NNND +8%\n* NVDA +7%\n* V +1%\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6RJNKXU](https://imgur.com/a/6RJNKXU)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market\u2019s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market\u2019s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events \u2014 the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.\n*****\n&gt; The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think earnings are going to be a good component,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cCompanies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we\u2019ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won\u2019t be as bad as it could have been. It won\u2019 be strong. We\u2019ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran\u2019s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.\n*****\n&gt; The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there\u2019s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises\u201d it could be negative, Arone said. \u201cThere\u2019s skepticism already. If there\u2019s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. \u201cI think they\u2019ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,\u201d he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.\n*****\n&gt;# Economy\n&gt; Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.\n*****\n&gt; There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed\u2019s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. \u201cIt seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,\u201d said LaVorgna.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CmRDJ3H.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HlaBE2S.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Mo3s1ZX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4GkiL8Z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wA851N3.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nbY9KQS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vGlTvp3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2v0Lf7h.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lm2IGKk.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YDrQkZN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VzMB0Wn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/V8ea808.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/HXQ4K2F.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years\n\n&gt; Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance during January\u2019s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar track records since 1999.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6fef4ad5d96054008c1e22c647ef89b/f40a371ec0746e08-6e/s500x750/7ef3526f7c7aa39a8e897b65d44ba23869993cbe.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3c8ee058fc90aa22adb4e5a8985e306/f40a371ec0746e08-73/s500x750/a78a5931f9321df2ca4938803b6adba45329fa6c.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5741ff34a0d07dd0833b196609574b9/f40a371ec0746e08-77/s500x750/282a979aced717ffa33f2e4ebf6cac6eb92e0118.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 378 Days since Last 10% S&amp;P 500 Correction &amp; Still Counting\n\n&gt; There is little doubt that 2019 was a good year for the market. DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&amp;P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&amp;P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fbda173e8dc370504a0f606427f62e1/ed8a77a7fe8ca133-e0/s540x810/8954d23b3dc93b4653c4fbb6e79bc909488fdeec.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events\n\n&gt; It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.\n\n&gt; As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we\u2019ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.\n\n&gt; \u201cNo doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.\u201d\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&amp;P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.\n\n&gt; A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/geopolitical-events-and-stock-market-reactions.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&amp;SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.\n\n&gt; Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we\u2019ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.\n\n&gt; We did some research and found that when S&amp;P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&amp;P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn\u2019t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/do-the-first-5-days-of-a-new-year-matter.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cShould you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don\u2019t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year\u2014like 2020\u2014the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren\u2019t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-first-five-days-of-2020-could-have-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# \"Take my crude, please\"\n\n&gt; Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-WTI-Declines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dow 29,000?\n\n&gt; By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-DJIA-29000.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 10th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9wEbsG4rHc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fim7EDbAptk))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$PNC** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$PPG** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$TSM** \n&gt; * **$WNS** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$HOMB** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$RF** \n&gt; * **$OGI** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$HWC** \n&gt; * **$WAFD** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$EGBN** \n&gt; * **$OZK** \n&gt; * **$BEDU** \n&gt; * **$PBCT** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$INDB** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$BMTC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2sH0ItO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/acnOb3c.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e3hO4am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/duE2t8W.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I9iQ8f1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pQtl1r8.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lXhI0YM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jpODGmg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NYyWxgm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJ8xHj2.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nsBUIFM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $136.07\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020.\n\n# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**\n*****\n&gt; With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.\n*****\n&gt; The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&amp;P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.\n*****\n&gt; Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed\u2019s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWe had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings roll out\n&gt; There are more than 135 S&amp;P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald\u2019s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cComing into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there\u2019s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.\n*****\n&gt;#  Fed is big story but won\u2019t say much\nThe Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it\u2019s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that\u2019s going to be the key messaging,\u201d said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \u201cI think the data has been okay. There\u2019s really nothing new there. The only thing that\u2019s really new or interesting is going to be what\u2019s going on with the balance sheet.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.\n*****\n&gt; Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed\u2019s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.\n*****\n&gt; For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. \u201cThe intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed\u2019s target range, \u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the technical move, they \u201cmay be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Economic data\n&gt; There\u2019s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter\u2019s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Jh9TsGk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PC0Wzg3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HbDh9Vc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mbOqHih.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vvAjRp1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H2E0IGA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EzxkRa0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D9nkFqV.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ueyg2Ui.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xc2z54D.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/mFxq4a0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XjxVPqW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/uiduXrQ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid\n\n&gt; Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA\u2019s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&amp;P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.\n\n&gt; In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday\u2019s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40266be6ec0ea5254acf28b7b6d1382f/9bf6345fd07e4a41-a7/s500x750/adacad5fc51e44798ccb9e3f4f840aeb1cf88bad.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64ed8994efe5e18c82cdb0e191844380/9bf6345fd07e4a41-00/s500x750/da09894ccf7e9c51f7a3814ee73a4a9e65fefeca.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71145fa04257eb5aad5eec7945276aa7/9bf6345fd07e4a41-02/s500x750/48e6c017697fc7e130ffcdabcb46093f3c28522b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we\u2019d take another look at this impactful year.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500\u2019s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; From a quarterly view, the S&amp;P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That\u2019s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/quarterly-return-012220.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Recession Watch Update\n\n&gt; As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it\u2019d be a good time to check on LPL Research\u2019s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.\n\n&gt; As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn\u2019t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle\u2019s continued durability.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:\n\n&gt; We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It\u2019s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.\n\n&gt; We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&amp;P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&amp;P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 24th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUWzJw_T-Y))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.26.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HXyp_tGZDQ))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$UTX** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$S** \n&gt; * **$NURO** \n&gt; * **$HMST** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$XLNX** \n&gt; * **$ARNC** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$BX** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$GD** \n&gt; * **$PHM** \n&gt; * **$NVR** \n&gt; * **$PII** \n&gt; * **$SALT** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NUE** \n&gt; * **$ALK** \n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$MPC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/LryC0HR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/UJ0XUOn.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4WIKCya.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZqdHlAC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uNAMC1F.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yyFyqKK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGue9UL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D7CJT4Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gAvYCNR.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RKvojKG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1aQuGJs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5YpKIPM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0KJmsx.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Apple, Inc. $318.31\n&gt; **Apple, Inc.

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI thought it might be worth the effort to post a comparison of Meta Growth (META), High Tide Inc. (HITI), Inner Spirit Holdings Ltd. (ISH), and Fire and Flower Holdings Corp. (FAF) based on a Price-to-Sales ratio to see if it might provide any interesting information, since they\u2019re all retail companies.\n\nRevenue Assumptions\n\nMeta Growth is the only company that has filed an annual report for this year as of this post, so the \u201cRevenue\u201d figures for the other 3 retail companies in my sheet are based on the following averaged calculations:\n\nMETA = Total Reported Annual Revenue of CAD 54,101,660 as of August 31, 2019. [(P. 5)](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-Financial-Statements.pdf)\n\nHITI = Net Revenue of CAD 8,288,000 for the 3 months ending July 31, 2019 / 3 = 2,762,666 per month x 12 months = 33,152,000 [(P. 7)](https://hightideinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3Q19-Financial-Package.pdf)\n\nISH = Total Revenue of CAD 3,991,640 for the 3 months ending September 30, 2019 / 3 = 1,330,546 per month x 12 months = 15,966,560 [(P. 3)](https://innerspiritholdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Interim-Financial-Statements-Nov-21-2019.pdf)\n\nFAF = Total Revenue of CAD 13,699,728 for the 13 weeks ending November 2, 2019 / 13 = 1,053,825 per week x 52 weeks = 54,798,912 [(P. 3)](https://wp.fireandflower.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/FF-FS-Q3-2019-v15-for-Sedar.pdf)\n\nOutstanding Share Count and Stock Price Assumptions [(VWAP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp)\n\nI\u2019ve read the most recent financial reports for each of these companies and, to be honest, it just got too fucking complicated to cite figures from each report because they\u2019re all reporting on different timelines and different reporting schedules, etc. \u2013 so I decided to use the consolidated information available from [The Marijuana Index](https://marijuanaindex.com/) because I look at that site every day, and because (after a few comparisons) the figures on the site seem pretty close to what each company has reported (in terms of outstanding share count).\n\nRegarding the Stock Price, I chose to use the [Volume Weighted Average Price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp) (as reported by The Marijuana Index) at the close on Friday, January 17 because the VWAP price represents the ratio of the value of a stock traded against the total volume traded over a particular time horizon (usually one day). I think it\u2019s a better stock price quote since some of the debenture holders who receive shares in lieu of interest payments often lob in bullshit sell orders for one or two shares every now and again to manipulate the price of the stocks in question. (Ask me about that later)\n\nAnyway, and without any further ado, I present you with the following Price to Sales Ratio comparison:\n\n|META||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Market Cap|$52,759,380.00|Shares Outstanding|VWAP Stock Price|\n|Revenue|$54,101,659.00|187,090,000|0.282|\n|P/S Ratio|0.9752|||\n|||||\n|HITI||||\n|Market Cap|$47,739,630.00|Shares Outstanding|VWAP Stock Price|\n|Revenue(\\*)|$33,152,000.00|208,470,000|0.229|\n|P/S Ratio|1.4400|||\n|||||\n|ISH||||\n|Market Cap|$23,923,840.00|Shares Outstanding|VWAP Stock Price|\n|Revenue(\\*)|$15,966,560.00|206,240,000|0.116|\n|P/S Ratio|1.4984|||\n|||||\n|FAF||||\n|Market Cap|$148,417,650.00|Shares Outstanding|VWAP Stock Price|\n|Revenue(\\*)|$54,798,912.00|133,110,000|1.115|\n|P/S Ratio|2.7084|||",

Question: do the long, long-term benefits outweigh the cost you the loses of daily re-balancing? If we're talking 10 years here might it still be worth it for a IRA account if you're under 30 and have less than 50k? \n\n2 - The other option is trading on margin. This video doesn't discuss this much. Can you buy the index (VOO) on margin in an IRA account? If so, why not do like 15% of your total index investment as margin? What's the argument against this second type of leveraged indexing?",

Yes, I'm really that bad at male ukulele and human voice singing. Which is why what I'm about to say is all the more insane, like why-are-you-buying-TSLA-600-calls absurd -- but we all know why now. \n\nI'm a full time musician, a private educator during the day and performer by night. I run a band that I'm particularly proud of; not like you would be for a kid when they get a gold star on their math homework or something but like *truly* my life's passion that I pour my everything into on the daily. We're starting to tour more and need a van, and on the verge of releasing a 3rd album. These things all cost lots of money and although we recoup the cost, we bear them on the front end and therefore need operating capital. Given my degenerate choice of profession, I've only been able to sustain this for 6 years. At this point, I don't have anything besides my safety net &amp; IRA saved up to pour into my band. [I had about 2k](https://imgur.com/vyzXnBJ) in my memefolio before stonkmarket2018 boofed ketamine in the twilight months. **So, in act of absolute retardation, I'm asking you WSB. Will you help me realize my dream?**\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"Is this motherfucker asking *us* for money for his dumb band that's destined for failure and embarrassment?\" and you're right to think it. Most bands are a fucking joke, a pipedream that only a mother could attend on a regular basis (but even she has standards and would find a convenient excuse not to attend after awhile). We're not bad. We're really fucking good, actually. And we work our asses off, this isn't just smoking weed and noodling w our buddies. Last year [we played a sold out show w/ Khruangbin](https://www.facebook.com/events/boulder-theater/sold-out-khruangbin-with-ghost-tapes-at-boulder-theater/1098362527002657/), opened for [Cory Henry of Snarky Puppy](https://www.ticketfly.com/event/1832766-revival-cory-henry-taron-boulder/), and supported our pals The Main Squeeze at festivals and theaters over the course of 2019, as well as toured through the southwest for the first time. If you wanna see/hear some shit [watch our video EPK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmhUoc58Okg) in which we jerk ourselves over awards and press and such. \n\nI know how retarded this all seems, but I fucking believe in this band and the work we've done already. Now we need a little help to get us on the road with this new album, so I'm ass out &amp; lubed up for what needs to come. Feel free to ask your questions. I suppose the best way to donate would be our band paypal: ghosttapesco@gmail.com\n\nIf you're interested in being a financier on the real, please send us an email too -- we're down to be more formal about it and pay you back or set up an ROI plan that works for you.\n\nTL;DR i'm gay for music pls help",

Figured I'd share some tidbits of his that I found interesting for the sake of discussion.  \n\n\nOn Repo and Balance sheet growth:  \n\n\n\"In order to address this repo issue, we've grown the balance sheet...But I'm very sensitive from here that we need to be finding ways to limit and temper the growth in the Fed's balance sheet...  \n\n\nOn \"Not-QE\":\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"On the one hand it's not QE because we're not buying on the long end of the curve, but on the other hand it's having some effect on risk assets. **It's sort of a derivative of QE. When we buy bills and inject liquidity, it affects all  risk assets. I'm of that view**....This is why I say growth in the balance sheet is not free, there's a cost to it, and we ought to be sensitive about it.\"  \n\n\nHe also mentions it's important that they communicate a plan to wind down/temper balance sheet growth.  \n\n\nOn inflation:  \n\n\nDiscusses that although employment is low, inflation is limited due to structural technology \"issues.\" Sees inflation to be muted in the future due to this, and how it isn't susceptible to monetary policy.  \n\n\nThinks we'll see changes on how they articulate inflation targeting, whether it be via a range or a longer averaging period.",

You know whose moved faster than these guys?   \n\\- SpaceX (founded 2002) landed rockets on goddamn boats  \n\\- Facebook (founded 2004) figured out how to destroy democracy  \n\\- THE ENTIRE SMARTPHONE INDUSTRY STARTED 3 YEARS LATER  \n\\- America elected both a non-white person AND a reality TV star as president.\n\nFor crying out loud, a new Half Life is landing before these guys actually launch their service.\n\nMy point here is that this team has literally shat the bed for 15 years, I'm not sure what makes you think &lt;i&gt;now&lt;i&gt; of all times they're magically going to get their act together.\n\nBut maybe you believe that the revenue opportunity is massive - and they're just on the cusp of raking in all that cash.   \n\\- SPCE has disclosed that they have ONE working plane. They have another that maybe they'll have by some time next year. They plan for 5 by 2023.  \n\\- They have plans for hypersonic travel - but thats more than 5 years out.  \n\\- At max they have 5 people flying per flight. They only make profit after the 2nd one, so you can back into at least how many flights they can have with their current list of 600. And any partially filled flights are going to drag on their margin.  \n\\- Also any unexpected maintenance really fucks with earnings when you have ONLY ONE PLANE.   \n\n\nBUT here's the rub - the really interesting bit is that they had to go through this SPAC process because they were running out of cash, and Richard Branson was tired of throwing his own money into a pit. What's crazy here is that instead of doing normal things (raising capital through an IPO, doing a round with any of the massive VC firms that clearly love pissing away money, raising debt, or looking for to be acquired) they opted for essentially a direct listing.  \n\n\nWhy do it this way?   \n1) They probably couldn't raise the money (let that sink in - WeWork was probably a more convincing business model than this shit)   \n2) No one wanted to buy their IP (likely because its super nascent and all the decent engineering companies thought it was not worth the amount Richard Branson spent)  \n3) The easiest people to feed this garbage to are retail investors too dumb to do research. \n\n  \nAND LASTLY:   \nGo to their fucking website. They're shilling Microsoft Edge. Any company that &lt;i&gt;proudly&lt;i&gt; boasts how deeply they've partnered with Edge does not instill any confidence in their technical prowess.   \nThat isn't a joke: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=94&amp;v=uvWrirMnZEs&amp;feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=94&amp;v=uvWrirMnZEs&amp;feature=emb_logo)\n\nGet out while you can, or join me with puts on this BS.",

        "selftext": "\u2026 had dinner with a friend last night who works at a top hedge fund. His view is that what has driven valuations up in equity markets are low interest rates. This makes sense because low interest rates make equities relatively\u00a0more attractive v. debt and means you're willing to settle for a lower free cash flow yield - i.e. higher valuation.\u00a0If interest rates go up, equity markets should get crushed.\u00a0What would make interest rates go up?\u00a0Inflation.\u00a0What would cause inflation?\u00a0Wage growth resulting from the extremely tight labor market in the US.  \n\n\nWhat do you guys think about this statement?",

        "selftext": " With this run up in Tesla stock, do you all feel it's still good to get in or has it achieved irrational exuberance like the .com stocks did in 99. Do you still feel it has a chance to go up more or is it way overvalued? I also don't understand how it reached this high considering its fundamentals. What do you all think?

        "selftext": "I started an RRSP upon the insistence of my step-father in 2014. Its helped me reduce my taxable income a couple years, but i've since realized that I would be better served by a TFSA and ETFs. \n\nThe RRSP (Industrial Alliance: Dividend Growth - Canadian Equity) has a small balance; $1429.03. In addition, because I withdrew $5000 in 2016, under the Life Long Learning Plan, I owe $500/year starting in the 2020 tax year. The fund is performing well right now, +18.13% over the past year, but +6.38% since opening the account in 2014. MER is 2.58%\n\nI am looking to establish a passive portfolio, and this fund certainly doesn't meet the low-cost criteria. I was looking into transferring the balance to a Wealthsimple RRSP, but there will be a $135 transfer-out fee. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1) If I transfer the fund, when I making my LLP payments, they will be added to the new account, right? Are there any conflicts transferring RRSP providers while in repayment under this program?\n\n2) I am trying to weigh the options - although the MER is high, the return is decent. On the other hand, I feel like the fund isn't properly diversified and it's historical performance hasn't been exceptional. I am unsure if it's worth going through the hassle of trying to transfer the fund. I see several options:\n\ni) Keep the money in Industrial Alliance in perpetuity. \n\nii) Paying the $135 transfer-out fee in order to move the fund to WS. \n\niii) I could probably come up with the $3500 over the summer, pay back the LLP as a lump sum payment in order to surpass the $5000 balance required for WS to cover the balance. Then transfer to WS. \n\niv) Make the minimum LLP payments, and re-evaluate in 10 years when the balance is paid off. \n\nv) Cash out. 10% withholding tax + $50 fee. \n\nIt seems like regardless, I am stuck with roughly ~$5000 in a RRSP with Industrial Alliance, or another provider. I'll be aiming to max out my TFSA in the next 2-3 years, and will not be considering additional RRSP deposits unless I get an employer match in the immediate future. \n \nAm I overthinking this? Thoughts are appreciated.",

        "selftext": "To give you all some context, I started \"investing\" in index funds years ago and so far so good in terms of gains. However, I realized that one of goals is to attempt to retire at an earlier age. I'm currently 25 and would like to retire in about 15 years. Expenses are around $1500 per month. I have about $20k+ invested in index funds (S&amp;P500).\n\nI started considering building a dividend stock portfolio this year, investing \\~$2500 per month for a total of $30,000 by the end of the year. This could allow me to build passive income from dividends and potentially achieve early retirement.\n\nI'd like to know your thoughts on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso extra, but I made a video about this explaining everything (feel free to give a thumbs up, would be greatly appreciated!) : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJUqIW-a40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJUqIW-a40)",
