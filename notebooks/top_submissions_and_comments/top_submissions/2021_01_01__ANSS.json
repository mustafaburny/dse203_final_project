YOLO even applies here. MVIS has been in buy out/merger/strategic investor negotiations since last April and has successfully completed 3 crucial pre-launch stages that were required for their moon-shot launch in 2021! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\n*Stage 1: Avoid a reverse split \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMVIS completed this stage on May 19, 2020 via shareholder vote. Oddly enough this 1st step required shareholders to actually APPROVE a reverse-split in order to avoid the reverse-split. Strategery. Again, this is advanced wsb retard stuff. If you do not understand what you are reading, please proceed to the rockets below.\n\n*Stage 2: Regain $1 Compliance \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThanks in part to the shareholder vote, MVIS completed this 2nd stage on June 18th 2020 after announcing that former Google Augmented Reality OG, Mark Spitzer was added to their Board of Directors. https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-addition-dr-mark-b-spitzer-its-board\n\n*Stage 3: Prevent potential bidders/buyers from waiting out MVIS' cash position. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMVIS completed this 3rd and final stage on Oct 8, 2020. More strategery here as shareholders were asked to whip out their \ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf46 and slap the other side of the negotiating table's bidders/buyers in the face with them, by approving a 60m share authorization. MVIS can now survive until 2022 while they finish their LiDAR sensor due in April 2021.\n\nhttps://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/iss-and-glass-lewis-recommend-approval-microvision-proxy\n\nhttps://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-third-quarter-2020-results\n\n\u201cMicroVision is focused on pursuing a strategic transaction at the right value for our shareholders. Our focus is to drive to an agreement at a valuation that reflects the sustainable strategic advantage, we believe, our technology offers now and into the future. We are continuing to work towards this goal while maintaining expenses at appropriate levels. We appreciate the strong support of our shareholders, as evidenced by the vote at our special shareholders meeting on October 8th as we continue the work ahead,\u201d said Sumit Sharma, MicroVision's Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\u26a1BONUS STAGE\u26a1:\n\nMVIS added former Ford Director of Technology, Judy Curran to their Board of Directors. Judy currently works for Ansys as its Head of Global Automotive Strategy. Ansys is a simulation software company used to simulate multi-physic systems including ADAS systems (aka LiDAR)!\n\nhttps://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-addition-judy-curran-its-board-directors\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTL;DR MVIS has bad ass Augmented Reality &amp; LiDAR technology that is being extremely undervalued by the market; The company is currently up for sale, Serious Bidders/Buyers/Potential Partners are now forced to pay based on fair value(See VLDR &amp; LAZR market caps), Price is set to 2x-5x this year, BUY all the MVIS you can, Secure tendies.",

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "My TD Ameritrade interface has an interesting statistic \"short interest\". Short interest is defined as \u201cThe number of shares of a security that have been sold short by investors. It is typically expressed as a percentage of the total number of shares outstanding and is reported on a monthly basis.\u201d\n\nMade a list of the top 50 companies in the world by short interest and found Tesla has the second highest short interest at 7.99%, only behind Danaher at 9.97%. Rounding out the top 5 are Broadcom (AVGO) at 6.82%, Qualcomm (QCOM) at 6.56%, and UnitedHealthCare (UNH) at 6.48%.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway class A shares are the lowest at .09%. The average of all companies is 1.828%. Average of US companies is 1.934 and non-us companies is 1.05%. \n\nAlso decided to look up the short interest of PLTR (9.61%), SNOW (21.03%), ABNB (7.92%) and DASH (3.99%).
