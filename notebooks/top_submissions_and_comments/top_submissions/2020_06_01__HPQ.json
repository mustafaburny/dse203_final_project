        "selftext": "Welcome to another daily Unusual Options Activity post. Why do DD when you can see what other people are heavily investing in? A list of previous plays as well as resources are available at [https://www.noeticoptions.com/](https://www.noeticoptions.com/). \n\nRecap \u2013 Congrats to everyone following the plays, you should have made out quite well today. The SPY ended up 2.4% but the previous plays on average well out-performed the increase on the SPY.  ON and WY both had stellar days ending at 20.16, +6.22% and 23.42, +5% respectively. SU from yesterday also had a 10% increase. ZUO was the only one that did not participate in the rally, but still ended up green (mildly) at +.79%. If you played TECK, FLEX, or continued to hold NCR from earlier in the week \u2013 you also made out. Nice.  \n\nDue to the demand for more classical unusual option plays these posts will now be divided into Unusual Momentum Option Activity and Classic Unusual Options Activity. \n\nUnusual Momentum Option Activity - \n\n**June 5th, 2020 Option Activity Fast Facts \u2013** \n\n**Highest Multiple over Daily Avg (with ADV &gt;5k) \u2013 DD with 8x its ADV of 8,327 and 10k calls traded and 59k puts.**\n\n**Ticker with most contracts Traded \u2013 AAL 1.1 Million and 4x it\u2019s ADV. 571k calls traded and 536k puts**\n\n**Largest Put to Call Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) \u2013 BKLN with 135.4 P/C Ratio and 40,746 puts and 301 calls.** \n\n**Largest Call to Put Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) \u2013 CDEV with 150 C/P Ratio and 36,520 calls and 243 puts traded.** \n\n***1.***  ***Ticker :BHC*** \n\n**Spot Price** : $19.24\n\n**Company Summary :** Bausch Health Companies Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets a range of pharmaceutical, medical device, and over-the-counter (OTC) products primarily in the therapeutic areas of eye health, gastroenterology, and dermatology. The company operates through four segments: Bausch + Lomb/International, Salix, Ortho Dermatologics, and Diversified Products. The Bausch + Lomb/International segment offers products with a focus on the vision care, surgical, and consumer and ophthalmology Rx products in the United States; and Solta products, branded and generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products, and medical device products, and Bausch + Lomb products in Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. The Salix segment provides gastroenterology products in the United States. The Ortho Dermatologics segment offers dermatological products in the United States; and Solta medical aesthetic devices internationally.

Jun 19 \u201920 20C also had 2k.** \n\n**My Impression :** June 10th of next week is the Goldman Sachs 41st Annual Virtual Global Healthcare Conference. Perhaps this is a play for some great news on the conference. Regardless, the momentum is very bullish and I don\u2019t think this move is veiled by CoVID-19 euphoria. The call C/P Ratio and amount of calls at ask are quite bullish. \n\n***2.***  ***Ticker :*** ***HPE***\n\n**Spot Price** : 11.15, +.67 (+6.39%)\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company provides solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze, and act upon data from edge to cloud.

Perhaps some are expecting some news from HPE. A lot of the volume for the Jun 19 \u201920 11.5C came in after 3 pm. The C/P ratio is pretty positive. Could be a good play to buy the rumor and sell the news. \n\n**CLASSIC UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY \u2013** \n\nThese plays are listed on the blog post at :\n\n[https://www.noeticoptions.com/](https://www.noeticoptions.com/)\n\nSummary : \n\nQuick note about ON : This stock would have made the list today, but it was already included a few days ago. If you are still holding ON, I\u2019d keep your position. C/P Ratio was 56.8% with 51% of calls bought at the ask. This hit my 5% TP this AM so I am out, but it still looks like a solid play. The JUN 19 \u201920 21 strike had a lot of action today 11k contracts sold. \n\nSABR would have also made momentum list but I decided to include in the Classic UOA section. In my opinion it fits both and looks like a good buy. \n\nBoth BHC and HPC are getting volume from conferences. This worked out reasonably well with FLEX earlier in the week. Buying the rumor and selling the news is always a good idea. If you are to enter any plays I would wait until after the open Monday because there is likely to be a decent pull back. \n\nAs always, please visit my website [https://www.noeticoptions.com/](https://www.noeticoptions.com/) .  I also have an instagram : [https://www.instagram.com/noeticoptions/](https://www.instagram.com/noeticoptions/) which I will post on when there is a new post. \n\nThanks for reading, enjoy the weekend!",

        "selftext": "So, pretty much, HP is still killing the laptop game, as companies do more work from home. Companies are giving every employee a laptop to work. Not only that, but they are using the laptops as dummy terminals for access to Virtual Machines. Now granted, it's a risk with the supply chain, but as long as that stays somewhat stable, I think it's a sure bet.\n\nThe other possibilty is that HP has a merger, which it's easy tendies.\n\n11/20 C25$  currently only .17",

        "selftext": "VerifyMe is a development stage company transforming into a commercial company very quickly.A strong management team has made the right connections.VerifyMe has a recent contract with a large global customer.The next earnings report will be the first to include revenue from the large global customer.This stock is way off the radar and could make a big splash with its next earnings report and worth seeing how it develops from there.\n\nVerifyMe (OTCQB:VRME) ( now on NYSE as of days ago). is a provider of anti-counterfeiting technology and solutions. The main product is security printing with authentication serialization technology for product labels. The company is in the early stages of commercializing its products which I described in an early January article, VerifyMe Is Swinging For The Fences.\n\nThe move up from the OTC, where the stock is currently trading, to the Nasdaq as well as cleaning up the balance sheet are designed to make the company more of a palatable suitor for U.S. government as well as foreign government business.\n\n All outstanding debentures will be converted resulting in post IPO fully diluted 6 million share count and 1.5 million outstanding warrants. At a market price of $5 to $6 (it's 4 now) per share, the market cap will be just under $40 million. Management expects to raise about $6 million from the IPO and there is **No debt**The capital raise demonstrates the wide interest, including institutional investment that is supporting the success of this IPO.\n\n\u00a0S-One is the infrastructure, providing inventory, marketing and sales services in 30 countries.\nHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) provides cannisters, uses VerifyMe's ink in its digital presses and provides its worldwide salesforce.\nMicro Focus International PLC (MFGP) provides software support.\n\nIn other words they are just getting the ball rolling and I expect great things from them moving forward.  They have been on the rise and have successfully reached from OTC to the NYSE. They are under the radar and should pick up very well once recognition In the market is gained.\n\nRisks: They still need to establish more business partners and grow sources of revenue.\n\nThey had to reverse split to gain compliance to even be listed as well as do an offering but the good news in that is it just happened and the offering is now closed. This was more to gain compliance than them needing the help.\n\nThe volume is low but I expect that to change the more the market gets interest.\n\nThey were just listed so the price is subject to movement to find its stable ground. Once again this could be good or bad depending on market sentiment the more it catches on.\n\nLast although not a risk should be mentioned, they are new so until the word gets around Growth might not be as fast but we can definitely change that as the reach of this sub and all their connections can put it on the map. \n\n\nEnd post",

        "selftext": "HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE (HPE)\n\nI spent a good few hours looking into HPE on friday. its one of the few tech stocks which is still hanging about its post covid lows. Used to trade aound $15 per share pre Covid and after dropping to $8 in march its still just at $9.50, about 36% down.\n\nI have a thing for stocks which are underperforming, i feel like im getting a good deal. I take a look at the price over the past years and love to buy something at an all time low. In truth this is a behavioural bias and in no way provides better returns. In fact, an underperforming stock will likely continue to underperform and an outperforming stock will contiue to outperform. Having said that, every so often you come accross a gem, so long as you can rationalise the reasons the stock keeps dropping and can see the situation changing. \n\nBack to HPE, i like the sector, i like the current price level. Whats next?\n\nTime to look at some research and numbers.\n\nPrice earnings ratio is 8.3\n\nDividend is 5% - not bad, not great, but certainly not bad.\n\nRevneue - dropping year on year - very bad sign\n\nCredit Rating - BBB - Company has a low chance of going bankrupt - Google credit ratings for more info\n\na few more numbers, a bit more complex so i wont go into details now, but i also look at\n\nHow much equity in the company\n\nIntangible assets as a % of total assets\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nCash from from operations\n\nAll in all the company has ok fundemental numbers, its certainly not a growing company but it wont go bankrupt. The main thing which should be a flashing warning sign is the falling revenue.\n\nCompanies where revenue is decreasing year on year indiciates that the company isnt performing well. Will probably not grow and provides little reason for the stock price to increase down the line.\n\nTime to look at what people are saying on the interenet about HPE.\n\nThere are quite a few investing forums on the interenet so you should be able to google the company and see what people are saying about the stock. usually peoples opinions are biased depending on whether they are invested in the stock or not, so take what you read with a pinch of salt.\n\nI did read one thing on reddit which was another red flag for me. It was an employee who spoke about work ethic at the company. It seems many of the employees there beleive they arent working for a leading tech company and have the attitde that they are only 'HP' not Apple/Amazon/Cisco so employees arent going the extra mile.\n\nAlso people on the HPE reddit were saying that their support is terrible and their products arent that great. Seems to me they are surviving by selling to their existing client base and provide few reasons for new clients to choose them.\n\nFinally i take a look at the professional analysts recomendations, usually analyst recomendations are biased and hardly anyone would say a stock is crap and should not be bought. There are quite a few reasons for this but i wont go into it now.\n\nIve attached a screen shot of the analyst recomendations for HPE. In short the red/yellow/green bar shows the number of analysts recomending you to sell/hold/buy the stock atm. Currently the stock is showing 26% of anaylsts say buy it, 65% say hold it (dont buy it if if you dont have it but dont sell it if you already hold it), and 9% say sell it. [https://imgur.com/tkVwH3Z](https://imgur.com/tkVwH3Z) (bloomberg)\n\nIn the end this stock is probably worth buying if you want to hold onto it for a month or two only as it might pull back to previous levels. Its not a good long term buy though, in my opinion. Revenue falling, lots of competition and bad employee work ethic.",

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder.

However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.

The company operates through four segments: Bausch + Lomb/International, Salix, Ortho Dermatologics, and Diversified Products. The Bausch + Lomb/International segment offers products with a focus on the vision care, surgical, and consumer and ophthalmology Rx products in the United States; and Solta products, branded and generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products, and medical device products, and Bausch + Lomb products in Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. The Salix segment provides gastroenterology products in the United States. The Ortho Dermatologics segment offers dermatological products in the United States; and Solta medical aesthetic devices internationally. The Diversified Products segment provides pharmaceutical products in the areas of neurology and other therapeutic classes, as well as generic and dentistry products in the United States. The company was formerly known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. and changed its name to Bausch Health Companies Inc. in July 2018.
