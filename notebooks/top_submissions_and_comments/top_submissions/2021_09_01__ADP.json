        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 1, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed in the first session of September, which is historically the worse month for equities. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both eeked out a new intraday record high, closing 0.07% and 0.17% higher respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.10% while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.67%. Market participants continue to digest comments from the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech from Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants wait for new, crucial economic data, namely the August Job Report, set to be released on Friday. \n\nDespite some choppiness near the middle of the month, the SPY closed out its seventh straight month of gains, rising nearly 3% during the month of August, bringing the performance of the index to a staggering 20% gain year-to-date. Despite the risk posed by potential inflationary pressures and the coronavirus Delta variant, market participants remain encouraged by the pace of the economic recovery, record corporate earnings, and a still accommodative Federal Reserve.\n\nADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the offical August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.\n\nMark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said of the report, \u201cThe delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery. Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months. Job growth remains inextricably tied to the path of the pandemic.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve talked about it the last few days, but here is the full transcript from Powell\u2019s speech on Friday\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to the Department of Commerce, construction spending in the US rose 0.3% on a monthly basis and is up 9% year-on-year. The infrastructure bill currently mulling in Congress should be a further boost to this spending.\n* Ford Motors (F) said it is forced to once again trim production due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. said it will cut two of three shifts at its Dearborn Truck Plant next week, while its Kansas City Assembly Plant F-150 production will be down. This is like the third of fourth time this has happened with no end of the chip shortage in sight. \n* In tangentially related news, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that 2021 has been the year of \u201csuper crazy supply chain shortages\u201d and pointed to delays in shipping. Here is the tweet [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065)\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a \u201csuper follow\u201d feature that allows creators to generate monthly revenue by sharing subscriber-only content. The company hopes the future will attain at least $7.5 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2023.\n* After a steep sell-off following an intense regulatory crackdown by the CCP, shares of Chinese stocks were moving higher today.\n* The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it identified a 12th crash involving a Tesla (TSLA) vehicle using driver assistance software. This comes amid a probe for 11 crashes identified a few weeks ago. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) target raised by Argus from $215 to $225 at Buy.

        "selftext": "Stocks once again traded, mixed, this time with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly underperforming relative to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both of switch had a last minute rally to close barely on the green. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the three major indexes, rising 0.68%. Following the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole Symposium last week, market participants are anxiously waiting for the August Jobs Report, which will further illuminate the state of the labor market, a key factor in the Fed\u2019s decision-making regarding a potential taper timeline. \n\nADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month.

Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.\n\nMike Loewengart, managing director of investing strategy at E-Trade Financial, wrote in a note to clients, \u201cThe private payroll numbers have been all over the map during the pandemic. But with so much pressure on improvement on the labor market front coming from the Fed, this could send a signal that jobs growth is stagnating. That\u2019s likely a good thing for the markets, though, as it means easy money policy continues.\u201d \n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d As I have said multiple times in the past, personally, I remain bullish even during tapering talk, I think the real test for equities will come when interest rate hikes start being discussed.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s drive to \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d. \n* Walmart (WMT) bumped hourly wages by $1 to an average of $16.40 an hour as the holiday season, the most important time of the year for retailers, is set to kick off.\n* Yesterday, I talked about Ford Motors (F) cutting back production due to chip shortages. Today, General Motors (GM) followed suit and announced it would be cutting production goals due to the global shortage in critical semiconductor components.\n* A Federal Judge ruled the Apple (AAPL) must face a class-action lawsuit alleging the Siri recorded private conversations due to \u201caccidental activation\u201d. \n* Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Broadcast app, a popular tool for online live-streamers is updating the app to improve noise removal, support more cameras, and reduce the amount of VRAM used by the app. A spokesperson for Nvidia said, \u201cThe new update addresses this with dedicated training sound profiles to retain that speech while removing the unwanted background noise.\u201d\n* According to Bloomberg news, Tesla (TSLA) was forced to temporarily halt operations at its Shanghai factory last months due to the global shortage of semiconductors. This is affecting car manufacturers the world over.\n* Toyota, the world\u2019s largest car manufacturer said it would slash global production for September by roughly 40%, again due to the chip shortage.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Bill.com (BILL) target raiosed by BTIG Research from $290 to $310 at Outperform.

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/labor-day-weekend-and-more-bullish)\n\n**TLDR:** stock market news sentiment remains significantly bullish for yet another week in a row, driven by optimistic monthly reports released for the month of August and continued upward trends from the SP500 and global cryptocurrency market.\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nAs we commence our first week of Autumn 2021, stock market news remains just as bullish as it was to end the summer. News coverage this week was relatively unchanged in terms of sentiment compared to last week. Overall, the average finance article written this week scored a 0.35 in terms of sentiment (meaning that just over 1-in-3 sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically) and a 0.63 in terms of time-sense expressed (meaning that almost 2-in-3 sentences published this week were written in future tense). Here\u2019s a look at the major news events driving the continued all-time high bullish sentiment this past week:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Stocks: The major U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range all week, but the S&amp;P 500 managed to post a modest gain for the second week in a row.1 The NASDAQ outperformed its peers for the second consecutive week while the Dow fell slightly. Despite sustaining a mid-month decline, the S&amp;P 500 recovered to record its seventh positive month in a row, posting a return of about 3% in August. The index reached 12 record closing highs in the month versus 7 in July.\n\n\u20bf Cryptos: Much of this week\u2019s news optimism can be attributed to the continued meteoric rise in cryptocurrency prices. Global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew 11.5% this week to $2.4T dollars to cap off the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume. The majority of crypto-related headlines this week came on the back of Ethereum ($ETH) which rose more than 20% to $3,935.17 per coin this week at the time of this writing; other big crypto movers this week include Solana ($SOL) and Bitcoin ($BTC) as it eyes its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d since May 2020.\n\n\ud83e\udd85 Economy: While news optimism remains relatively high overall, time-sense fell slightly this week as a slew of monthly economic reports were released for the month of August. A private report showed that the U.S. economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in manufacturing activity in August. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index rose 0.4% to 59.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity. We also saw August\u2019s monthly job report this week. The economy generated 235,000 new jobs last month, far short of economists\u2019 expectations and trailing gains of nearly 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July.\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\nEach week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here: [most mentioned tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d976bee-76fb-40f8-b7b7-1a97515e6ff3_1230x753.png)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple ($AAPL): For the second consecutive week, $AAPL was mentioned more in news coverage than any other ticker in finance articles scraped this week. A mainstay of our weekly most-mentioned list, Apple Inc. churns news headlines, whether or not there\u2019s actually significant news to report about the company or its stock. Following the 10-year anniversary of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as Apple CEO last week \u2014 as part of which he received $750M in $AAPL share value under the terms of his contract \u2014 headlines this week centered around an open letter written to Cook by Apple employees presenting a litany of grievances including concerns about privacy and diversity within the company. Apple also saw headlines from outside the workplace this week, as regulators from around the world mount pressure on the company\u2019s current App Store policy, accusing Apple of exerting too much control (ex. a 30% commission on in-app purchases) on developers who use it to sell products.\n\n\u201cWhat is Apple Thinking?\u201d | The New York Times\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Automatic Data Processing Inc. ($ADP): The ticker with the biggest increase in news headlines this week compared to last week was $ADP. The stock fell a slight -0.86% last week and has now dropped nearly 3% over the past month to $207.38 per share as the company plans to go ex-dividend on September 9th. This means investors who purchase and settle shares of $ADP before this upcoming Thursday will be eligible to receive the company\u2019s $0.93 dividend payment per share, which will be paid out on October 1st. Automatic Data Processing\u2019s previous dividend payment consumed approximately 61% of the company\u2019s free cash flow last year, and while this is in the normal range for most dividend-paying organizations, analysts seem to agree that the decision bodes well for the company\u2019s long-term strategy by freeing up some space on their margins during a relatively lean period in its history as a business. Overall news sentiment for $ADP scored a +41.05% on a scale from -100% to +100%, signaling relatively bullish sentiment to boot over the past week.\n\n\u201cAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. Is About To Go Ex-Dividend, And It Pays A 1.8% Yield\u201d | Yahoo Finance\n\n# 3. Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\nEach week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. Here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in this past week\u2019s news: [most optimistic and pessimistic tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ce2ff0-9cf0-4d9e-b630-893857f80eee_2181x1305.png)\n\n# Sentiment: Most Optimistic\ud83d\ude00 and Pessimistic\ud83d\ude12 Tickers\n\n\ud83d\udcf6 Motorola Solutions Inc. ($MSI): This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Motorola Solutions Inc. (optimism score: 58.9%). $MSI stock rose a mere 0.76% on the week to build on 46.7% growth so far in 2021. Motorola Solutions \u2014 which succeeded Motorola, Inc., following the spinoff of the mobile phone division into Motorola Mobility in 2011 \u2014 has been spoken of with relatively good cheer compared to industry competitors like Qualcomm ($QCOM) and Verizon ($VZ). Much of the optimism has come as a revelation following the company\u2019s Q2 earnings released nearly a month ago on August 5th, in which the company revealed stratospheric annual earnings per share growth of 41% compound. While some may call it an old-fashioned investment in today\u2019s age of \u201ctech-stock blue sky investing\u201d, it\u2019s hard to argue with bonafide profitability like this if you\u2019re investing for the long-term. This week\u2019s most optimistic $MSI article:\n\n\u201cHere's Why I Think Motorola Solutions Is An Interesting Stock\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n\ud83d\udc15 Shiba Inu Coin ($SHIB): This week\u2019s most pessimistic (and reactive) ticker in news coverage was Shiba Inu Coin (pessimism score: 29.3%). Even though we saw relatively low amounts of pessimism in this week\u2019s news coverage across the board, $SHIB saw more pessimism expressed in articles this week than any other ticker, as the fringe cryptocurrency reached its lowest price of the past month on Tuesday (a whopping $0.000006735 per coin \u2014 yes, that\u2019s five zeroes after the decimal) as its developers announced that they\u2019d be removing a portion of the existing $SHIB supply from circulation. Though $SHIB price rose considerably heading into the weekend and continues to trend upwards at the time of this writing, it\u2019s still down 11% in value over the past month. Keep in mind that the coin \u2014 which was created in April as a blatant meme and borderline Ponzi scheme in response to the meteoric rise in the price of Dogecoin early this year \u2014 has grown 45x in value since its inception four months ago. In other words: a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu Coin back in April is now worth somewhere around $42,000.

($FE): The stock with the most speculative (ie. future-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was FirstEnergy (speculation score: 95.4%). $FE stock 2.86% this week to $39.59 to cap a 34.16% run in share price year-to-date as the energy utility company has benefited from improving electricity demand in recent months. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. retail electricity sales are likely to inch up 2.7% in 2021 after sliding 3.9% in 2020. Given the growth in demand, coupled with FirstEnergy\u2019s 96.5% earnings growth this year and given that its stock is still trading 52.8% below its estimated fair value (according to Simply Wall St.), analysts speculate that its stock is set to remain a handsome mid- to long-term investment. Analysts also cite $FE\u2019s 14% return on equity (ROE) as a reassuring sign that the company is growing in value and effectively managing investors\u2019 money. This week\u2019s most speculative $FE article:\n\n\u201cShould You Be Excited About FirstEnergy Corp.'s 14% Return On Equity?\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udc5c PVH Corp. ($PVH): The stock with the most reactive (ie. past-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was PVH Corp. (reaction score: 53.6%). $PVH stock price stair-stepped up 5.12% to $118.84 per share on Wednesday following the release of its Q2 earnings report, which beat consensus analyst earnings and laid out an upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year. The company (formerly known as Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation) is one of the world\u2019s largest clothing conglomerates and owner/licenser of brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole New York, and Michael Kors. PVH Corp announced quarterly earnings per share of $2.72 \u2014 crushing analyst estimates $1.52 \u2014 and posted revenue growth of 46% YoY to $2.31 billion as consumers begin to return to their pre-pandemic apparel shopping habits. Following the beat-and-raise report, analysts at JPMorgan and Credit Suisse both announced increased price targets for $PVH.

Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in each of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last: [image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ffb0c2-1e95-4b38-b913-cf5a9e81061e_2038x769.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcbd Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week after $AMD stock broke resistance above $109 per share early in the week; analysts at Benzinga say the stock has now settled into its second bullish pattern of the past month. On Wednesday, it was reported the U.S. Department of Energy was nearing a deal worth $500 million to purchase a supercomputer made with AMD and NVIDIA Corp.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Coinbase Inc. ($COIN) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week despite the stock rallying 8.62% to $278.44 per share. This increase in pessimism can be widely attributed to a handful of contrarian, negative articles published by the likes of the Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha arguing that the underlying volatility of digital assets makes Coinbase an inherently risky stock to invest in.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. ($HPE) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last as the stock remained relatively flat over the trading period, rising just 0.06% to $15.67 per share. Much of the speculation surrounding the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report released early in the week, in which the company\u2019s continued supply chain issues showed through. Analysts wonder if HP\u2019s component supply concerns will continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Moderna Inc. ($MRNA) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed after increasing in stock price by more than 13% to $416.70 per share on strong trading volume and new research released this week suggesting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 shot may offer longer-lasting protection that Pfizer\u2019s amid growing conversation about the importance (or lack thereof) of booster shots.\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis past week brought a close to the month of August and commenced the unofficial start of Fall 2021. In terms of market action, August was the 7th consecutive month of stock market growth, and the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trade volume. This past week was no exception to the tremendous momentum in both realms, and news sentiment reflected this: stock market news articles published this week saw more optimism expressed on average than any other week this year except for one (the first week of August, the height of Q2 earnings).\n\nLooking ahead into September and October, the extreme optimism is showing no signs of slowing down as Wall Street expectations for the next stock market earnings season continue to rise. Over July and August, forecasts for third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8%, according to FactSet. That\u2019s the fourth-largest such increase during the first two months of a quarter since 2009.\n\nWhile market bulls are currently reveling in the continued outperforms of stocks, market bears may be quick to point out that we are growing more and more due for some sort of correction. The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered a 5% pullback since October 2020. The last time the index experienced such a long period without a big drop was from June 2016 to early February 2018. With that in mind, we will continue to watch the progression of international economic factors like the COVID-19 Delta variant and the transition to Taliban rule in Afghanistan for any inkling of adverse impact on the U.S. stock market. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; good luck this week everyone, and thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

        "selftext": "This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\n**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put\u2026**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a \u201cBlack swan event\u201dby purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars\u2026Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I\u2019m saying that maybe it\u2019s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don\u2019t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m\u2026 another bearish catalyst for the market\u2026 I literally could go on and on guys\u2026. It\u2019s pretty obvious at this point\u2026we\u2019ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December. \n\nEdit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit\u2026",

Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026\n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\nSo investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nThe lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\nThey reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you. \n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\nLet me be clear\u2026I personally don\u2019t believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I don\u2019t want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do I\u2019ll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. \n\nSince the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\nShort term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\nLong term: \n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS. You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\nMy last position:\n\n$2,500 in Cash.\n\nSimply put\u2026cash is a position. People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. Timing this is almost impossible\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!",

It is an actual product that they are track testing and showing off at the IAA Mobility Conference in Germany. Look at the live demo they have up vs. our competitors: \n\n* Luminars Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/c8v23x](https://streamable.com/c8v23x)\n* Continental Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/gyee85](https://streamable.com/gyee85)\n* Velodyne Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/lhtsw2](https://streamable.com/lhtsw2)\n* Microvision Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/paywxe](https://streamable.com/paywxe)\n\nAs you can see by the point cloud and refresh rate MVIS sure looks best in class. MVIS is currently on the path of scaling for production and looking for partners.\n\nMarket Size - The global lidar market size is projected to reach **$6.77 Billion by 2026** and virtually every car company is investing/looking to utilize Lidar in the future for assisted and automated driving. It could be in every new vehicle. Luminar (LAZR) the inferior product as you can easily see by the videos above IPO'd last year with a market cap of $8.1 Billion.\n\n**AR/VR** \\- Microvision produces the MEMS Laser Beam Scanning display engine found in the Microsoft Hololens 2. It was confirmed through a tear down before and just officially via MVIS's last ASM. Also, since Microsoft produces the IVAS (rugged Hololens 2 for military use) it is highly speculated that MVIS is the engine inside that also.  \n\nMarket Size - According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), \u201cGlobal AR and VR Market information By Technology, By Component, By Device Type and Vertical - Forecast till 2027\u201d the market to reach **USD 766 billion by 2025.** Also, Microsoft just won an army contract this year **worth up to $21.9 Billion.** \n\nGoogle the Hololens 2 or IVAS units to see all the cool futuristic shit they can do. I'm not gonna spoon feed you everything.\n\n**Stock Info**\n\nCurrent Market Cap = $2.24 Billion\n\n52 Week High = $28\n\n52 Week Low = $1.38\n\nEstimated Short Interest = 29.75m or 18.29% of FF\n\n Q2 2021 shares held by institutions: **42,174,027 (25.7%)** \n\n**Summary**\n\nSince Sumit Sharma took over as CEO he continues to deliver on his promise to increase shareholder value. The company is open for a buyout, strategic alternative, or going it alone with it's amazing technology. Whatever will be the best route to **INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE**. At it's current share price we are way **UNDERVALUED.** There is more DD out there on the technologies, different verticals, and how we are at an inflection point for these things to pop. Go look at the MVIS subreddit and the meta thread there of DD I can't link.",

        "selftext": "So, Alibaba is of course the most discussed stock in the last month on this sub, I think. So I decided to discuss Tencent, instead.\n\nI think Tencent is simply incredible. Let's see why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WeChat** \n\nThey own WeChat/Weixin (Weixin is for mainland China, WeChat for everywhere else. I will call it WeChat). WeChat is.. WeChat. Mohnish pabrai calls it \"a bazooka Tencent can fire at will\". It has 1.25 billion users. What can you do on WeChat? Everything. Text, pay for stuff, play games, shop online, anything. Imagine if the following app existed:\n\n* Need something on Amazon? No problem, you can do it directly from WeChat through its mini-app.\n* Need to pay something in a shop? Use TenPay.\n* Need a ride on Uber? Use WeChat mini-app.\n* Need to order food on DoorDash? WeChat.\n\nReplace Amazon with JD, Uber with Didi, DoorDash with Meituan, and you have WeChat. \n\nWeChat is a bazooka beause, if Tencent decides to partner with someone and allows them to integrate in their ecosystem, that business will explode. It happened with Pinduoduo, which mainly works on WeChat: it grew 100% last year.\n\nSince it runs the platform, Tencent gets a commission. Also, it stores all the data that goes through these apps. In 2020, revenue from WeChat was 16.7 billion dollars, out of 74.6 billion in total. WeChat has 3.2 million mini programs on its platform, which transacted 1.6 trillion RMB (247 billion $) in 2020. To get how much this thing is growing, in 2017 it was 210 billion RMB (32b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's empire**\n\nTencent has an impressive number of businesses: they have a subscription revenue which is 62% that of Netflix; a media ads business (bigger than the Nyt), games, cloud, mobile payment services. Their business is so wide it is hard to navigate. Some examples:\n\n1. **Gaming**: Tencent has around 50% of market share in China in the mobile gaming industry. In 2020 they made 29.3 billions from games. In 2021 it is probably going to be lower. Online gaming industry in 2020 was 58b, it is expected to grow to 86b in 2027. Mobile gaming is projected to be 70% of the online gaming market in China by then.\n2. **TenPay**: There are two ways to pay for stuff in China: TenPay and AliPay. While in the West switched from cash to cards, and are still in transition, China has skipped a step and went directly to mobile payments. In 2018 already, a walloping 83% of all payments in China were made through mobile. Now it is around 90%. Cards are useless, in China: they account for less than 5% of payments. In the Western world, Google pay and Apple Pay are only now eroding the empire of Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. China, on the other hand, was to Tencent and Alibaba like a smooth field: they just took over. Apple pay now has around 500 million users world-wide. Tencent has 900 millions. From the last financial report, Tencent shows that revenue of the financial technology and corporate services business increased by 40% year-on-year to RMB 41.9 billion (6. billions). China's mobile payment market is projected to reach 88.4 Billion usd by the year 2027, trailing a CAGR of 47.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's fantastic portfolio**:\n\nBefore you do a cf analysis of Tencent, you need to know that Tencent has a portfolio that is currently valued around 250 billions usd at present. It is like a financial version of Cthulhu, with tentacles everywhere. It is quite hard to navigate/find information about it. They say they are currently invested in over 700 companies, of which only 103 are publicly traded. This guy has put up a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owpL6WmMK30X19Kw3BziAw39rGJbsfIMOOexdtvAkxU/edit) for you that tracks the most notable public ones.\n\nSome notable busineness Tencent owns (percentages might not be accurate):\n\na) Gaming:\n\n* 100% Riot Games (League of Legends)\n* 40% Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* 81.4% Supercell (Clash of Clans)\n* 10% BlueHole (PUBG)\n* 80% Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile)\n* 5% Activision Blizzard.\n* 20% Kingsoft (gaming competitor in China &amp; cloud business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Finance:\n\n* 30% Webank (biggest online bank in China)\n* 2%? Khatabook (digital payments in India)\n* 25% Gojek (same in Indonesia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Social:\n\n* 50.1% Huya (twitch-like)\n* 38% Douyu (twitch-like)\n* 12% Snapchat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) Music:\n\n* 58% Tencent music\n* 6.8% Spotify\n* 10% Universal music group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) E-commerce:\n\n* 25% Sea ltd (which also makes games, does mobile payments etc)\n* 18% JD\n* 17% Pinduodo\n* 7% Vipshop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf) Other\n\n* 20% Meituan (Doordash of China)\n* 15% Nio (ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Valuation**\n\nHow do you value Tencent? Currently, Tencent has a market cap of 619.72b, with a P/E of 24 and P/fcf (trailing 12 months) of 22 (Do not forget the investment portfolio, as well). fcf grew 29.4% a year in the last 10 years. Tencent has Microsoft-style profit margins of 35%. Revenue is growing at more than 30% a year, which is insane for a company this size. With its impressive portfolio, Tencent is poised to have a leading role in a country that is growing it GDP at 7%, that soon will catch up with the US, and where around 500 million people are projected to reach middle class in the next 10 years, something which will benefit tech companies the most. Of course, the risks are China regulations, in particular its anti-monopoly campaign; China in general: VIE structure, accounting standards etc. Here is an earnings based model, but take it with a grain of salt. \n\nDiscount rate: 14%. Based on eps without nri. 20 years.\n\n* Best scenario (20%): year 1-10: 25% growth, y 10-20: 10%. Value: 112.13\n* Normal scenario (60%): y1-10: 18%; y10-20: 10%. Value: 70.38\n* Worst scenario (20%): y1-10: 15%. y10-20: 8%. Value: 55.27\n* Fair value: 75.7\n* current price: 64.56. Undervalued by 17.25 % for a 14% return.  \n\n\nOf course it's all about assumptions. If you raise margin of safety, cut down growth estimates etc, you will get a very different number. I think I used a fairly conservative growth estimate, though. I personally think the upside for Tencent is insane., even though it is a behemoth already. It is one of my strongest buys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might consider doing a separate post about the risks of investing in Tencent: China regulations etc. For now.. thanks for reading!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider](https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) &amp; [gurufocus.com/](https://gurufocus.com/)\n\n[https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/](https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/)\n\n[https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/](https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/)\n\n[https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf](https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf)\n\n[https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html](https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html)\n\n[https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020](https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020)",

        "selftext": "A recurring theme over the past year has been one \u2018expert\u2019 after another bashing index funds calling them a massive bubble that is waiting to pop. \u00a0 \n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/z8f8yutkpvl71.gif)\n\n&gt;Could Index Funds Be \u2018Worse Than Marxism\u2019? \u2013 [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This \\[index funds\\] is very much like the bubble in synthetic asset-backed CDOs before the Great Financial Crisis. It will be the Greatest Speculative Bubble of All Time in All Things \u2013 [Michael Burry](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-has-found-the-next-market-bubble.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is Passive Investment Actively Hurting the Economy? - [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-passive-investment-actively-hurting-the-economy)\n\nBut at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week\u2019s issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \\[1\\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!\n\n**The Problem**\n\nThe argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)\n\nIf you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes\n\n**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**\n\nThe problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)\n\nIf you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \\[2,3\\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.\n\nAdding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it\u2019s something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it\u2019s not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\\[4\\].\n\nNow that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder\n\n**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**\n\nI believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)\n\nThe above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).\n\nFinally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.\n\n**Alternatives to index funds**\n\nWhile researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.\n\nAs of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN &amp; FB) account for more than 23% of the S&amp;P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.\n\nThere are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation\n\n[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&amp;P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)\n\n[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&amp;P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!\n\nWhile the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!\n\nUntil next week :)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (&gt;90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!\n\n\\[2\\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing\u2019s efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.\n\n\\[3\\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.\n\n\\[4\\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other.",

I am a salesperson at a Large FCA Store (Stellantis) Dealership in the midwest, and we are sitting on less vehicles today for sale in September, 2021 than we had in July, 2021. \n\n**Ram trucks factories are shut down right now.

Everything that requires a button in your car, fire stick remote controller, xbox controller, keyboard etc... requires a semi conductor.\n\nThe problem with the vehicle shortage is that the vehicle manufactures planned to schedule less chips in February 2021 for the vehicles of 2021 sales. They thought they would sell less vehicles this year because of the Covid, however, earlier this year, things opened and mask came off.  The car manufactures decided to instead order the same amount of chips as they usually do yearly, but the orders were already booked for other manufactures that needed chips. This is why you dont see a shortage in Smart phones, and computers, or TVS. The chip factories are producing chips for them first now before they can produce for car manufactures. It isn't because of a covid factory shut down...\n\nThis gives me reason to believe that demand will only increase for Semi Conductors and since TSM holds the most market in this area and they can generally control pricing. \n\nThis shows that the demand of current electrical devices int he world is actually far greater than we expected!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolid LongTerm Lifetime investment company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*At todays share price on September 3rd, 2021*\n\n*The P/E Ratio of TSM is 32X* \n\n*Apple P/E Ratio is 29X*\n\n*Microsoft P/E ratio is 37X*\n\n*Tesla P/E ratio is 170X*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Average analyst target of $147/share.*\n\nHigh of $200 and Low of $105\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n TSMC formed in 1987, located HQ in Hsinchu, Taiwan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xnxfeghadl71.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=439f443755a78bf1d3196f0dbf40094a440d3308\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1on5sfgiadl71.jpg?width=881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daec6d79172b837788407a8a9aa424e314dc045c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyjqrmekadl71.jpg?width=280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d23b13907924b9618d8f9def091308fbe0b0227\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dm7llfz59dl71.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0f312c9e543ffed4b23af9e395ced2ee39513dd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5o61y339dl71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b523709807728fb9e2e3493a8049ab218f24da6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/um88hin29dl71.jpg?width=1504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5552a028558c76441675d3bec3cedb4a722e5cd1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wv6gsi509dl71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f984f64edabdb85ef83e3ae665395b55e299a0b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwgxhayfcdl71.jpg?width=2119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a610a0371e7d27e6506ddec9a2f3ffbdea533bd2\n\nToday i bought 100 calls, (2 days after earnings) purchase and am expecting more long term purchased investments into this company.

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. \n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.\n\nWhich brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.\n\nHere's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)\n\nUnless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.\n\nAnother thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&amp;A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.\n\nI'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6jpncvw6dm71.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a7eca7bafa3737ba33fe74f0f222748a3175370",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nMy main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.\n\nI am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. \n\nI back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.\n\n[Back Testing Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=22&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=AAPL&amp;allocation1_1=20&amp;symbol2=AMZN&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;symbol3=GOOGL&amp;allocation3_1=20&amp;symbol4=MSFT&amp;allocation4_1=20&amp;symbol5=TSLA&amp;allocation5_1=20)",

I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months\u2026\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs\u2026however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid\u2026.\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be\u2026however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially\u2026.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "When I started trading I was trying to follow the mantra of \"don't invest more than you're willing to lose.\" This resulted in sort of a max of $400-500 that I would put in per individual stock and I definitely had too many going at once to see any legit profit. \n\nI have also read that I should have specific rules set and follow them, setting emotions aside. With this, I have set my initial investment around $1-2K as well as buying puts to hedge potential drops and/or setting Stop Limits for a % I would be willing to lose. My goal is to hit around a 20-30% ROI before selling. There are a few I plan to just buy and Hold, but others I would like to swing trade over the span of a few months. \n\nThe more I think about it, wouldn't it be better to put far more (10-20K) into a stock that is very likely to increase in value over time, like blue chip stocks - wait for it to drop to a 20-50 day MA, invest and look to get out when that 20% is hit. \n\nBut you can't time the market! I know, I know but stocks like MSFT, AAPL, JNJ, PG and many others aren't likely to just drop to 0 even if they do have a pullback (which is when I would buy). Plus, I would have purchased a Put and/or set a stop loss with what I'm comfortable losing. \n\nHow hard do you all go in on your initial investment and do you really need to up the ante to see consistently high returns?

I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better.

I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.\n\nWhich brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.\n\nHere's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)\n\nHere are my positions: [https://i.imgur.com/5s6tFfe.png](https://i.imgur.com/5s6tFfe.png)\n\nUnless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.\n\nAnother thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&amp;A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.\n\nI'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nMy main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.\n\nI am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. \n\nI back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.\n\n[Back Testing Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=22&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=AAPL&amp;allocation1_1=20&amp;symbol2=AMZN&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;symbol3=GOOGL&amp;allocation3_1=20&amp;symbol4=MSFT&amp;allocation4_1=20&amp;symbol5=TSLA&amp;allocation5_1=20)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 8, 2021**\n\n*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range.

And its stock is inexpensive. \nBy Eric J. Savitz \n\nThis should be a magical moment for Plantronics, the producer of conference-room products and office headsets, better known as Poly. \n\nWith a gradual return to the office, there is expected to be a surge in \"hybrid meetings\" -- mixing in-person and virtual participants. Poly CEO Dave Shull estimates that there are about 50 million conference rooms globally, and that 10% or less are equipped for videoconferencing. That is a huge potential opportunity for Poly (ticker: POLY) and its competitors. \n\nShares of Poly, meanwhile, have been driven down to bargain-basement levels by the fallout from an ill-fated merger three years ago. At a recent $32, the stock now trades for about 0.7 times anticipated revenue for the March 2023 fiscal year, and just under eight times projected profits for the same period. \n\nIn comparison, Logitech International (LOGI), which has an overlapping set of products, trades for about 3.2 times revenue and 22 times projected profits for the same period. \n\nAt such deeply discounted levels, investors willing to be patient could reap rich rewards as a turnaround gets underway at Poly.",

        "selftext": "TOM SIEBEL: Well I think we're right on track with what we communicated when we took the company public. So far, we've exceeded expectations every quarter. We're on the growth trajectory that we projected. We have become the world's leading provider of enterprise AI applications.\n\nWe just formed a very, very strategic relationship with Google Cloud where the almost 4,000-strong sales person organization at Google Cloud will be selling all of our applications globally, so that dramatically increases our sales capacity, say, by a couple of orders of magnitude.\n\nAnd I think the company's right on track, and you know, I don't really watch the stock price day to day. That's not my job. I think, as far as I'm concerned, we have $1 billion cash in the bank. We have enough money to do what we need to do. The market can just close for five years, and I think if it opens, then all the shareholders will be happy.\n\n- Some strong words. I was going to ask you about the stock move. I know you don't like to comment on it, but we are seeing it under some pressure today, so I just wonder what you think investors are missing in terms of the growth story that C3 AI is on right now.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, let's think about this. We deliver 40 turnkey enterprise AI applications a day, for banking, for manufacturing, for oil and gas, financial services, telecommunications, and manufacturing. Google Cloud decided they wanted-- these are very, very high value applications, where these companies are realizing billions of dollars a year annual economic benefit from these apps.\n\nNow, the Google Cloud decided that they wanted to change the competitive dynamics of the hyperscaler market, and lead with turnkey enterprise applications rather than CPU seconds and storage as they compete against the other hyperscalers.\n\nIt's a new think about this in terms of, maybe they needed to approach a partner who had a portfolio of applications like that. How many doors are there to knock on in the world? There's virtually only one. We're the only company in this business. We're the only pure play in enterprise application software in the world, in applications, other than, say, toys. Like, toys would be storage, or toys would be virtualization, or toys would be a machine learning library. We don't deliver toys, we deliver applications.\n\nSo we're the only company in this game. This is a-- probably a $300 to $400 billion addressable market, and I think we're going about establishing a market leadership position in that space, and that's the big picture. And I think we have three, four, five, ten years to execute that strategy. If we execute it, this will be one of the great technology companies in the world.\n\n- Yeah, let's use that five year frame here, then. Because you know, I felt like when we were at the IPO stage, right? When was that? A year ago, more than a year ago, right? When we're looking at the growth rate, right? And you came on, and you were kind of honest about, we're not going to run 75% growth all the time. It's going to moderate a little bit, and we've seen that now in terms of, kind of, subscription revenue here up 29%, total revenue up 29% year over year.\n\nI mean, when you look at that five year time frame, and position it where the stock's trading now, I mean, what is it that you would tell investors about where you'll be in five years if all the things pan out? The Google Cloud partnership, and also the government contracts that it sounded like analysts might not have been projecting quite correctly.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, I think, you know, again, whatever the stock did this morning is, you know, it'll do what it does. And the 29% growth rate will put us in the top decile, certainly, of high growth companies in enterprise application software. The analysts' predictions are that our growth rate will accelerate in the coming years.\n\nAnd I think the company is right on track. It's all good. I think we're very pleased. We're pleased with our Microsoft partnership, our Google partnership, our Baker Hughes partnership, FIS partnership. This company is right on track, and I'm quite pleased with the results.\n\n- You've got a pretty broad footprint right now across sectors, whether that's in manufacturing or financials. A long list here in terms of your research on enterprise AI. Where are you seeing the biggest growth right now? What are you most excited about?\n\nTOM SIEBEL: I think in the long run-- so today, we're huge in energy, oil and gas-- excuse me, energy efficiency, telecommunications, manufacturing, aerospace, defense, intelligence. In the long run, I'm personally most excited about precision health. Precision health will be the largest commercial application of AI, where we will be able to do very precise disease prediction, and therefore be able to intervene clinically and avoid the diagnosis.\n\nWe'll have AI-assisted medicine, genome specific medical protocols. I think the economic and social benefits that will accrue from applying AI to precision health are going to be really staggering. This will-- people will live longer, they will be healthier, we will deliver health care at lower cost, and we will do it-- we'll deliver-- using devices like this, we will be delivering health care to a massively large, previously underserved communities.\n\nSQUEEEEZE!

        "selftext": "TLDR\n\nThis article was written by Dogefather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u203a who ascertains as a result of research \u203a to provide thorough \u203a readable \u203a analysis. His trading strategy is Long only \u203a Value \u203a Growth \u203a with a medium to long-term horizon. Dogeboy is generally wary of tech stocks \u203a as this sector is ripe for disruption. However \u203a due to TEAM's steady predictability &amp; rapidly growing revenues \u203a he aggressively solicits a posture of Atlassian long game \u203a as one can make room in a portfolio for tech companies that are the disruptors &amp; carry a moat. \n\nConnected Enterprise\n\nAtlassian \u203a TEAM \u203a produces software that helps teams work together more efficiently &amp; effectively \u203a offering a broad set of \u203a easy to deploy &amp; use tools \u2933 Jira \u203a Confluence \u203a Bitbucket \u203a Trello.\n\n83% of Fortune 500 companies use Atlassian software products \u203a utilized by more than 212K customers at both large &amp; small organizations \u203a for open teamwork models &amp; autonomous project planning &amp; management \u203a that provides an environment for enterprises to experiment &amp; optimize employee experience \u203a for frictionless work environments \u203a business partners \u203a in a connected vendor ecosystem \u203a for easy interaction back &amp; forth &amp; quick response to market signals \u203a &amp; connect with customers \u203a to deepen relationships via those processes.\n\nAs teamwork becomes increasingly digital \u203a investing in a connected enterprise is the clear path forward for 10 million monthly active users who use Atlassian cloud collaboration management tools &amp; help desk solutions \u203a to support a variety of collaboration styles &amp; provide standardization to innovate &amp; cut costs. \n\nAtlassian operates in 4 segments \u2933 1 \u203a subscriptions \u203a term licenses &amp; cloud agreements \u2933 2 \u203a maintenance \u203a annual maintenance contracts that provide support &amp; periodic updates &amp; are generally attached to perpetual license sales \u2933 3 \u203a perpetual license \u203a upfront sale for indefinite usage of the software \u2933 4 \u203a other \u203a training \u203a strategic consulting &amp; revenue from the Atlassian Marketplace app store.\n\nFirst Mover Advantage\n\nWhat sets Atlassian apart is its first mover advantage in its core market. Given the time sensitive nature &amp; delivery windows of most software projects \u203a most of Atlassian's customers simply don\u2019t have the appetite for risking project execution nor the time to adopt a new platform. This has resulted in creating a moat \u203a  as there are indirect costs associated with the learning curve &amp; switching altogether to another platform. \n\nAtlassian delivers the tools &amp; platforms that developers need to build applications \u203a with every company in every sector becoming a software-driven company \u203a there will be almost infinite demand for new applications. As developers raced to build new applications to help their companies cope with the pandemic \u203a they gravitated toward the tools that enabled them to work the fastest &amp; most efficiently. Every company from the smallest mom &amp; pop shop to the largest multinational realized with utmost clarity that they would live or die by software.\n\n\u201cWe are a multi-product company. We differ from many companies that get product/market fit &amp; grow to $500 million in revenue before their second product. We introduced a second product \u203a Confluence \u203a before we reached that scale. We found that customers perceived that software documentation is poor \u2014 we developed a product for document collaboration that\u2019s like a Google Doc on steroids. We have multi-product in our DNA. We now have 14 different products.\u201d \u2933 Cameron Deatsch - Chief Revenue Officer.\n\nAtlassian applies the now-popular agile systems development mindset to all its operations. \n\n\u201cAs far as process \u203a we use an agile approach. This differs \u203a from the traditional waterfall approach \u203a in which system requirements are developed over two years &amp; handed off to the systems development people to build. With agile \u203a we start with customer goals &amp; iteratively build versus the goals. Every two weeks we ship something &amp; learn from it. We can apply this approach to marketing \u203a closing the books \u203a &amp; so on. We have daily stand-ups &amp; two week sprints.\"\n\nCustomer Growth\n\nAtlassian products meet a unique market need for business customers \u203a modernizing collaboration through human-centered technology \u2933 including office productivity tools \u203a video conferencing platforms \u203a file synchronization \u203a sharing solutions \u203a content management apps &amp; more \u2933 empowering companies to design experiences that unlock less fragmented workflows &amp; bring people together in seamless \u203a interconnected &amp; digital experiences.\n\nThey are able to land customers at a low cost with little human intervention. In the latest quarter \u203a Atlassian brought in 17k new customers who never talked to people at Atlassian or its partners \u203a equating to a robust 9.5% sequential QoQ growth \u203a driven by 5.7k  Trello accounts \u203a as a result of new product features &amp; TEAM\u2019s recent sales funnel optimization initiatives.\n\nThe addressable market size in total is an estimated $125 billion \u203a in terms of potential users \u203a including 800 million knowledge workers at the highest level \u203a drilling down to 100 million technical team members &amp; 23 million software developers. Atlassian noted\u00a0during the recent industry conference \u203a the company continues to out its online ecosystem \u203a with a marketplace for over 4k apps that utilize its product technology \u2933 recently launched Forge \u203a which provides runtime for these apps.\n\nAtlassian invents new products through processes propelled by its employees. \u203a it builds on its strengths \u2933 a focus on teams\u203a of which there are many different kinds in different industries \u203a come up with new products by looking at customer use cases &amp; trends outside the norm. Service management is the fastest growing product.\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nAtlassian continues its strong track record of growth \u203a Q3\u201921 revenue growing 38% YoY \u203a driven by subscription revenue growth of 43% YoY. Subscription now comprises 62% of TEAM\u2019s total revenue &amp; its recurring nature helps to smooth out the revenue stream \u203a resulting in higher predictability.\n\nAtlassian has grown impressively over the past few years because it adopts a low-cost web-based marketing &amp; lean transactional operating model \u203a going without a traditional enterprise salesforce &amp; marketing team. Atlassian has a large opportunity ahead \u203a demonstrating strong profitability relative to peers \u203a with a gross profit margin of 84% \u203a far higher than the 49% sector average \u203a a strong balance sheet &amp; plenty of cash to fund future growth initiatives \u203a its FCF margin is 43% \u203a comparing favorably to 12.6% sector median. \n\nGiven the subscription-heavy nature of the business \u203a Atlassian's revenue stream has resulted in sequential quarterly revenue growth over at least the past 3 years &amp; this includes pandemic quarters. Atlassian stopped new sales of server license \u203a increased pricing &amp; created pull-forward effects that incentivize users to renew early \u203a leading to strong revenue &amp; billings growth. Atlassian has demonstrated impressive revenue growth since its IPO in 2015 \u203a growing by 513% over this timeframe to $1.96 billion for the trailing 12 months. Atlassian maintains a fortress balance sheet to fund growth initiatives, with $1.56 billion in cash &amp; short-term investments \u203a no long-term debt, and just $206M in capital leases.\n\nTEAM has outperformed the market in the last year with a price return of \u2191 91.4% while the SPY ETF gained \u2191 30.1%. TEAM has also outperformed the stock market ETF in the last 3 month &amp; 2 week periods returning \u2191 62.1% &amp; \u2191 11.3% \u203a respectively \u203a SPY returned \u2191 8.3% &amp; \u2191 3.2%. Last quarter \u203a Atlassian reported $560 million in Revenue &amp; $.24 earnings per share \u203a this beat revenue expectation by $35 million &amp; exceeded earnings estimates by $.06.\n\nValuation\n\nPotential for competition from legacy software provider Microsoft \u203a MSFT \u203a in the space in which TEAM operates. Atlassian will directly compete against ServiceNow \u203a NOW \u203a as it encroaches on the service desk space. Atlassian\u2019s formal planning processes are adjusted so it can adapt to new threats or opportunities. That\u2019s what happened last year when a competitor\u2019s IPO gave it extra capital to spend on marketing to Atlassian\u2019s customers. Atlassian reprioritized go-to-market resources to keep customer acquisition up in light of that competitor\u2019s spending. One product leader got less. They have OKRs &amp; they adjust.\n\nDisclosure\n\nWithout data \u203a you're just another \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f with an opinion \u2933 Dogeboy\u2019s 17 Sep 21 calls are \u2191 770%",

        "selftext": " Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \"Global AI in Computer Vision Market By Offering, By Machine Learning Model, By Function, By Application, By End User, By Regional Outlook, COVID-19 Impact Analysis Report and Forecast, 2021 - 2027\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06131405/?utm\\_source=GNW  \nThe AI in a computer or a computer-enabled robotic system makes it capable to manage information and generate results in decision making, learning, and solving problems. The results are produced in such a manner that they are quite similar to the thought process of humans.  \n\n\nComputer vision is one of the domains of computer science. It is focused on reproducing the intricacy of the human vision system. This enables the computers to recognize and process objects from the presented images and videos in a similar manner like humans. As a huge amount of data is generated on daily basis, it is important to have the application of computer vision. Therefore, it is the key catalyst for the growth of computer vision. The precision rates of object detection have been improving with superior and advanced hardware and algorithms in computer vision. The percentage of accuracy reached from 50% to 99%, so computers are responding more quickly to visual inputs as compared to humans.  \n\n\nThe increasing need for automation and quality inspection, growing demand for computer vision systems in non-conventional applications are the major factors driving the growth of the AI in computer vision market. Moreover, the increasing need for ASICs is also expected to boost the growth of the market. Similarly, favorable policies and government initiatives to support industrial integration and adoption of AI into the edge devices are likely to create new growth avenues for the market players. However, increasing security concerns associated with cloud-based image processing and analytics are likely to restraint market growth.  \n\n\nCOVID-19 Impact  \n\n\nThe sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 has impacted various industries. Though, it had a negligible impact on AI in the computer vision market. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a major impediment to the export-oriented economies from a regional point of view. It is due to the temporary closure of manufacturing units. For example, the automotive industry of Germany has been rigorously affected because most of the automobile trade in this region takes place with China and Italy. Apart from the issues related to imports and exports, the manufacturing industry growth in Germany has also been hampered by the shutdown of manufacturing plants and reduces speed in operations in order to curb the spread of COVID-19.  \n\n\nOffering Outlook  \n\n\nBased on Offering, the market is segmented into Software and Hardware.

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

Now normally this wouldn\u2019t mean much, BUT due to Biden\u2019s push for cybersecurity as of late, as well as several other factors, it's actually incredibly well poised to explode and reach andromeda.\n\n**Bullet time**\n\nNow i could post all about their earnings, volume movement, target estimation, outlook, but you\u2019re lazy ass doesn't want to look at that so I'll just be loud, quick and decisive with some handy dandy bullet points :\n\n* In the last week or so their stocks has increased 10%\n* Still merely under 10$ in price per share, their so low right now that an increase in their price would magnify gains greater than any blue-chip could reach\n* Regardless of the actual performance of the company their placement as a market leader gives them an intrinsic advantage in data service opportunities provided by the government ( oooooo big boy words )\n* Considering major companies like google, Microsoft and amazon all have extremely large portions of themselves dedicated to data, it is not unwise to assume \n\n**The Real shit**\n\n\\****Alright time for some fuckin graphs.***\n\nThis first graph provides information regarding the speculated data services over the next 6 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwlp3sozc7l71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9efc951faee4b1adab0d77263cd28468fcf14181\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5op8tozc7l71.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4c17582bc4ff91cb4afd762eda89278631e67b0\n\nNow, if you have eyes, one can see that this is clearly an exponential trend which would of course coincide with a positive change in CYXT\u2019s stock price as well. Now you may ask yourself \u201c well why hasn't it gone up yet then ya fuckin doofus\u201d. Well ya piece of shit, I'll tell you : amazon and other companies like it have been mostly monopolizing data services and Cyxtera hasn\u2019t been in a position to fight back. HOWEVER, Biden has made a strong push towards antitrust scrutiny of amazon and other such companies. Thus allowing for it to get a foothold that will allow it to hulk jump into space. \n\nAs was said before, its a major data management company but it\u2019s been faced with a variety of compounding factors that's been holding it down, with the biggest being : IT'S PRETTY NEW.\n\nIt's not just coming out dicks swinging right outta the gate it has to first develop a reputation and develop itself before people start putting money into it, and the time for that is very close at hand.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nBuy it or don\u2019t buy it, no matter what your choice is, feel free to...\n\n# Suck my meat on soft\n\nSummary : ( courtesy of RamenNoodles1776 )\n\nCyxtera finally hit 1.5 billion market cap, this new spac venture is well positioned to take advantage of Biden's push for cyber security. They are the third largest data colocation center in the world and went public with the svac spac purchase in august, which is now CYXT. They essentially have a secure path to hold all of business data acting as a giant server that has locations all over the world.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n*Noodle man Disclaimer, I do have a small amount of call options out through November on CYXT (after their quarterly report) and am in no way a financial advisor. This is an opportunity my amatuer self has noticed, let me know what you all think.*",

        "selftext": "What\u2019s up my stoner friends. I re-rolled all the highlights from last week to this Monday on the stock market.  \n\nNon-farm data came out last Friday. It brought some concerns to the market, but I\u2019m gonna stick to my plan and keep buying more promising stocks. \n\n# Highlights:\n\n# 1. Non farm data2. Reddit IPO  3. Windows11 launches on 10/5\n\n\\-\n\n# Non farm payrolls out \n\nThe rising of Delta cases caused a dramatic drop - the monthly employment numbers went WAY lower than expected: 23.5k VS 72.5K, the unemployment rate also dropped to 5.2% compared to July.  \n\nMany experts consider this a signal of postponing \u201c the taper,\u201d which is a clear sign of slower growth along with uncertainty in the market. However, as wages and unemployment rate shows, it\u2019s not as bad as it looks. \n\nIn this case, I remain bullish in the short run. \n\n\\-\n\n# Reddit IPO = WSB IPO? \n\nThe birthplace of our beloved MEME stock, Reddit, is seeking to hire advisers for their IPO next year to GIT MORE $$$$. Targeting a 15$ billion valuation when listed on the stock market. I\u2019m expecting mayhem on meme stocks a week before Reddit\u2019s IPO.  We\u2019ll sit and wait before the show begins.  \n\n\\-\n\n# Windows 11 is one month away\n\nThe long awaited new windows OS will be released on October 5th as MSFT recently announced. It will be a free upgrade for you as long as you have a legit windows 10 in your devices. \n\nThat being said, as usual, the upgrade will roll out in phases - current windows 10 users will likely be offered an upgrade weeks after new products. Analysts estimate it will contribute 19% of MSFT\u2019s profit for 2021.  \n\nI personally am a big fan of MSFT in terms of their business model and outlook. New OS seems pretty decent and clean. So I will be adding more MSFT into my long term portfolio. Again. \ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you feel the same way about Windows11, also checkout my take on MSFT here:   \n\n\nAlthough it won\u2019t be as nice and peaceful as last week, I\u2019m still expecting slightly bullish on the market this week ahead overall.  Uncertainty isn\u2019t a bearish sign in this case as nothing fundamentally impacts the market in the short run.   \n\n\nThanks for your time, good luck and stay high.",

        "selftext": "Netflix, even though it didnt break 600 yesterday, its certainly still bullish and especially after being in a channel for the last 7 months, i think its due for a break out relatively soon. Also with the miss in jobs and more stimulus entering the market as well as the tapering not starting until November (probably) Id say this next week is a break out week . Now i could be completely wrong and netflix could again go back down to low 500s but idk TA showed a strong support at 580s. \n\nI dont have any positions in it yet but plan on opening a call.\n\nModerna , on the weekly chart it shows that the stock has been respecting the lower 300s support and just now is breaking out of that 3ish week long channel , we will see what happens next week but over all im bullish on it after that break out, i have a few calls for next week and hoping they print.\n\nMsft, I  love this stock, one thing about it is that after it breaks out it consolidates for a bit before breaking out again. Its been coslidating around 300s for a while now so im expecting a break out soon. Plan on opening a position in it after seeing next weeks price action.\n\nFacebook \\^ same applies as msft.\n\nGoogle is a monster expecting it to probably each 3k this week if im being honest, usually after a pull google hits new highs and it did have a pull back this friday so yeah.\n\nOther than that i really have nothing else to say except whats yalls views on these stocks? Also what do yall use for TA? I tend to use 5,20,50,200 emas , vwap and the regular trend lines on the daily and weelky chart how about yall?",

        "selftext": "Hey gang!\n\nMarkets were cruising for a good portion of the day before pulling back a bit. Really kind of a muted day for the markets as a whole, with the exception of the IWM charging nearly a full percent. That's good for our small caps! With markets stagnating and the VIX rising, tomorrow's market movement will depend on the nonfarm payroll numbers, which are released before the market opens. \n\nSome analysts are expecting the ending of expanded federal unemployment benefits to surge job numbers. If this month's payroll numbers disappoint, I expect next months to obliterate expectations as people will go back to work in some capacity and seasonal hiring will start picking up. \n\nObligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, replaying the best Star Wars game ever made Knights of the Old Republic (someone commented about this yesterday but it got swept away), etc. etc. etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BBIG|7.99|458.3K (74K)|89 - 11|Sept 20c (33.7K)|\n|RAAS\\*|5.68|28.4K (681)|86 - 14|Sept 7.5c (11.3K), Sept 5p (2.8K)|\n|KPLT\\*|5.53|96.2K (7.1K)|94 - 6|Sept 7.5c (20K)|\n|NXE\\*|5.44|3.7K (933)|91 - 9|Sept 5c (471)|\n|MMAT\\*|5.76|71.7K (30.1K)|89 - 11|Sept 5c (12.6K)|\n|GSAT|2.08|146.5K (24.1K)|89 - 11|Sept 2.5c (40.4K)|\n|MILE|4.44|43K (3.2K)|96 - 4|Sept 5c (14.6K)|\n|DNN|1.40|37.9K (7.7K)|95 - 5|Oct 2c (8K), Jan 23 2c (6.1K)|\n|INFI|3.82|30.5K (2.8K)|99 - 1|Oct 5c (16.5K)|\n|SWN|4.89|25.2K (7.6K)|89 - 11|Sept 4.5c (9.7K)|\n|PROG|1.05|21.8K (2.5K)|95 - 5|Sept 1c (4.8K), Jan 1.5c (2.9K)|\n|HIPO|4.39|16.1K (2.3K)|57 - 43|Oct 6c (3.1K), Sept 4p (1.9K)|\n|YVR|2.05|12.5K (1.2K)|100 - 0|Sept 2.5c (8.8K)|\n|CRVS|2.72|10.6K (84)|100 - 0|Sept 2.5c (5.3K), Sept 5c (5K)|\n|WTRH|1.28|9.6K (2.5K)|97 - 3|Sept 1.5c (2.2K)|\n|UEC|2.84|8.1K (3.3K)|96 - 4|Sept 2.5c (1.1K)|\n|HMY|3.53|4.9K (1.3K)|88 - 12|Jan 4c (3.7K)|\n|ADTX|1.80|3.8K (1K)|96 - 4|Oct 2.5c (1.5K)|\n|ALZN|3.35|3.7K (1K)|98 - 2|Sept 5c (2.4K)|\n|AMPE|1.73|3.4K (1.5K)|84 - 16|Sept 2c (987)|\n|CBIO|4.75|3.3K (614)|92 - 8|Oct 5c (780)|\n|WWR|3.92|3.1K (1.7K)|95 - 5|Feb 5c (1K)|\n|CRTD|3.37|3K (765)|97 - 3|Sept 5c (1.9K)|\n|JG|2.36|3K (375)|79 - 21|Oct 5c (762)|\n|REPH|2.45|2.9K (569)|99 - 1|Apr 2.5c (1.4K), Apr 7.5c (872), Apr 5c (600)|\n\n\\* denotes the stock started the day below $5/share\n\nNotes:\n\n**BBIG -15%** Experienced the inverse of yesterday, as there wasn't enough gas to keep on the upward pressure. 781.7K calls vs 173.5K puts in the OI heading into the trading session. 407.9K calls, 50.4K puts, and over 105 million shares traded today. BBIG just opened up weekly options, which I'm sure is going to blow up several people's accounts. If you're in the play for the \"proxy\", I wouldn't go with short term options, as theta will eat you alive. OI numbers are starting to shift heavily toward September expiration. \n\n**RAAS +21.8%** Was trading at $5.91 in the mid-day report. No news for the cloud-based communications company from China. Interesting that with a super bullish day, the second most active option are puts. Will they print tomorrow?\n\n**KPLT +15.8%** Was trading at $5.43 in the mid-day report. No news. Very popular stocks across social media right now. \n\n**NXE +10.3%** No news. Apparently uranium demand has been rising for months, according to u/Epraksemet_Nalej**.** Always interesting when a stock has elevated option activity, but one option hardly stands out from the rest. \n\n**MMAT +16%** In the mid-day report, MMAT was trading at $5.18. No news. \n\n**GSAT +11.1%** Was trading at $2.27 in the earlier report.  GSAT filed an 8-K update describing receipt of \"an additional advance payment of $37.5 million from a customer...\". The company will use the funds to repay some debt. Saw some saying \"Is this coming from Apple?\" Most likely no, as Apple isn't a customer of theirs. The Apple news was tied to the iPhone having Qualcomm chips. QCOM is a GSAT customer. \n\n**MILE +6.2%** Traded at $4.41 in the early report. I hate the amount of mail this company sends me. I don't want your pay-per-mile auto insurance, thx.  Big sweeps for ATM calls. \n\n**DNN +8.5%** Was trading at $1.36 in the early report. Again, apparently uranium is entering a super cycle. Multiple large (2,000+) orders for options at the $2 strike in both October and January 2023.\n\n**INFI +6.4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $3.80.  Announced they will participate in Wells Fargo's Healthcare Conference and H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference, both virtually. Notable that the most activity is for October calls. \n\n**SWN +4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $4.88. Completed acquisition of Indigo Natural Resources and updated 2021 free cash flow guidance. \n\n**PROG +7.4%** Traded at $1.02 in the early report. No news that I could find. Large sweeps for LEAPS. \n\n**HIPO -14.7%.** Traded at $4.38 in the early report. Has fallen 60% since it's SPAC-based IPO in January. Today marks the day private investment in public equity investors are able to unload their shares as per the merger agreement. Still a lot of call traders. \n\n**YVR +12%** Traded at $2.12 in the early report. Has given back 4.8% AH. Signed an agreement to acquire iNDIEFLIX, an \"edutainment\" company. \n\n**CRVS +16.7%** No news that I could find. Half of the unusual volume came from 5,000 bear call spreads with September options - sell the $2.50 call, buy the $5 call for upside protection. \n\n**WTRH -7.25%** Traded at $1.33 in the early report.  Supposedly one of the most shorted penny stocks, but these rumors are unsubstantiated. Perhaps someone can dig up the ortex numbers. \n\n**UEC +10.94%** Traded at $2.78 in the early report. Uranium stocks getting a lot of love today. Through UEC's finviz page I did find an interesting write up about uranium stocks that cited GLJ Research raised its price target on uranium mining company Cameco. The analyst for GLJ sees massive upside for uranium spot prices. Hmm if all of these uranium stocks hopped one one analysts recommendation, will the gains hold/continue or revert back a little bit? Worthwhile to note that the article I pulled this information from was published by notorious hedge fund The Motley Fool, who very well could be short uranium. \n\n**HMY -4.34%** Traded at $3.47 in the early report.  Released earnings either yesterday or the day before, I can't tell (conflicting sources). Two orders each for 1,750 Jan $4 calls under the \"Stock Contingent\" condition. \n\n**ADTX -1.64%** Back on the list after a brief absence. No news. \n\n**ALZN +5.68%** Traded at $3.32 in the early report. No news that I could find. Single order for 1,061 September $5 calls. \n\n**AMPE +6.13%** No news driving option/price movement that I could find. \n\n**CBIO -1.45%** Finally some different stocks other than the March bear call spreads as the most active. No news.  \n\n**WWR +1.29%** No news, and I don't think I've ever heard of this company before. They hold interests in a graphite project in Alabama. Formerly known as Uranium Resources, Inc, so potential Uranium sympathy play? Most popular options are pretty far out, could be a big short hedging their position. \n\n**CRTD -0.59% (+2% AH).** No news that I could find. \n\n**JG +15.12%** I couldn't find a direct reason for JG's big gain today. First time hearing about this Chinese mobile developer service provider. Always interesting when there's elevated option activity but not a single one stands out. \n\n**REPH -0.81%** Traded at $2.55 in the early report.  Apr ratio spreads continue to be the most active. \n\nIf anyone has any questions about anything, by all means, don't hesitate to reach out either here or by DM. I float the DM option out there because you might think something is too embarrassing to ask about, or you're new or whatever, but please just ask someone. Knowledge is the best weapon. \n\n*To reiterate - I DON'T PICK THESE STOCKS. They qualify by having elevated (at least 1.4x) option activity compared to normal. I'll be more than happy to check a stock's option activity for you, but save the \"wHaT aBoUt mY sToNk iTs gOiNg mOoN!\" type comments.* \n\nShout out to \"random ticker comment with no context\" gang!\n\nboom",

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/labor-day-weekend-and-more-bullish)\n\n**TLDR:** stock market news sentiment remains significantly bullish for yet another week in a row, driven by optimistic monthly reports released for the month of August and continued upward trends from the SP500 and global cryptocurrency market.\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nAs we commence our first week of Autumn 2021, stock market news remains just as bullish as it was to end the summer. News coverage this week was relatively unchanged in terms of sentiment compared to last week. Overall, the average finance article written this week scored a 0.35 in terms of sentiment (meaning that just over 1-in-3 sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically) and a 0.63 in terms of time-sense expressed (meaning that almost 2-in-3 sentences published this week were written in future tense). Here\u2019s a look at the major news events driving the continued all-time high bullish sentiment this past week:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Stocks: The major U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range all week, but the S&amp;P 500 managed to post a modest gain for the second week in a row.1 The NASDAQ outperformed its peers for the second consecutive week while the Dow fell slightly. Despite sustaining a mid-month decline, the S&amp;P 500 recovered to record its seventh positive month in a row, posting a return of about 3% in August. The index reached 12 record closing highs in the month versus 7 in July.\n\n\u20bf Cryptos: Much of this week\u2019s news optimism can be attributed to the continued meteoric rise in cryptocurrency prices. Global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew 11.5% this week to $2.4T dollars to cap off the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume. The majority of crypto-related headlines this week came on the back of Ethereum ($ETH) which rose more than 20% to $3,935.17 per coin this week at the time of this writing; other big crypto movers this week include Solana ($SOL) and Bitcoin ($BTC) as it eyes its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d since May 2020.\n\n\ud83e\udd85 Economy: While news optimism remains relatively high overall, time-sense fell slightly this week as a slew of monthly economic reports were released for the month of August. A private report showed that the U.S. economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in manufacturing activity in August. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index rose 0.4% to 59.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity. We also saw August\u2019s monthly job report this week. The economy generated 235,000 new jobs last month, far short of economists\u2019 expectations and trailing gains of nearly 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July.\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\nEach week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here: [most mentioned tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d976bee-76fb-40f8-b7b7-1a97515e6ff3_1230x753.png)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple ($AAPL): For the second consecutive week, $AAPL was mentioned more in news coverage than any other ticker in finance articles scraped this week. A mainstay of our weekly most-mentioned list, Apple Inc. churns news headlines, whether or not there\u2019s actually significant news to report about the company or its stock. Following the 10-year anniversary of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as Apple CEO last week \u2014 as part of which he received $750M in $AAPL share value under the terms of his contract \u2014 headlines this week centered around an open letter written to Cook by Apple employees presenting a litany of grievances including concerns about privacy and diversity within the company. Apple also saw headlines from outside the workplace this week, as regulators from around the world mount pressure on the company\u2019s current App Store policy, accusing Apple of exerting too much control (ex. a 30% commission on in-app purchases) on developers who use it to sell products.\n\n\u201cWhat is Apple Thinking?\u201d | The New York Times\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Automatic Data Processing Inc. ($ADP): The ticker with the biggest increase in news headlines this week compared to last week was $ADP. The stock fell a slight -0.86% last week and has now dropped nearly 3% over the past month to $207.38 per share as the company plans to go ex-dividend on September 9th. This means investors who purchase and settle shares of $ADP before this upcoming Thursday will be eligible to receive the company\u2019s $0.93 dividend payment per share, which will be paid out on October 1st. Automatic Data Processing\u2019s previous dividend payment consumed approximately 61% of the company\u2019s free cash flow last year, and while this is in the normal range for most dividend-paying organizations, analysts seem to agree that the decision bodes well for the company\u2019s long-term strategy by freeing up some space on their margins during a relatively lean period in its history as a business. Overall news sentiment for $ADP scored a +41.05% on a scale from -100% to +100%, signaling relatively bullish sentiment to boot over the past week.\n\n\u201cAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.

Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\nEach week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. Here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in this past week\u2019s news: [most optimistic and pessimistic tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ce2ff0-9cf0-4d9e-b630-893857f80eee_2181x1305.png)\n\n# Sentiment: Most Optimistic\ud83d\ude00 and Pessimistic\ud83d\ude12 Tickers\n\n\ud83d\udcf6 Motorola Solutions Inc. ($MSI): This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Motorola Solutions Inc. (optimism score: 58.9%). $MSI stock rose a mere 0.76% on the week to build on 46.7% growth so far in 2021. Motorola Solutions \u2014 which succeeded Motorola, Inc., following the spinoff of the mobile phone division into Motorola Mobility in 2011 \u2014 has been spoken of with relatively good cheer compared to industry competitors like Qualcomm ($QCOM) and Verizon ($VZ). Much of the optimism has come as a revelation following the company\u2019s Q2 earnings released nearly a month ago on August 5th, in which the company revealed stratospheric annual earnings per share growth of 41% compound. While some may call it an old-fashioned investment in today\u2019s age of \u201ctech-stock blue sky investing\u201d, it\u2019s hard to argue with bonafide profitability like this if you\u2019re investing for the long-term. This week\u2019s most optimistic $MSI article:\n\n\u201cHere's Why I Think Motorola Solutions Is An Interesting Stock\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n\ud83d\udc15 Shiba Inu Coin ($SHIB): This week\u2019s most pessimistic (and reactive) ticker in news coverage was Shiba Inu Coin (pessimism score: 29.3%). Even though we saw relatively low amounts of pessimism in this week\u2019s news coverage across the board, $SHIB saw more pessimism expressed in articles this week than any other ticker, as the fringe cryptocurrency reached its lowest price of the past month on Tuesday (a whopping $0.000006735 per coin \u2014 yes, that\u2019s five zeroes after the decimal) as its developers announced that they\u2019d be removing a portion of the existing $SHIB supply from circulation. Though $SHIB price rose considerably heading into the weekend and continues to trend upwards at the time of this writing, it\u2019s still down 11% in value over the past month. Keep in mind that the coin \u2014 which was created in April as a blatant meme and borderline Ponzi scheme in response to the meteoric rise in the price of Dogecoin early this year \u2014 has grown 45x in value since its inception four months ago. In other words: a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu Coin back in April is now worth somewhere around $42,000.

($FE): The stock with the most speculative (ie. future-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was FirstEnergy (speculation score: 95.4%). $FE stock 2.86% this week to $39.59 to cap a 34.16% run in share price year-to-date as the energy utility company has benefited from improving electricity demand in recent months. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. retail electricity sales are likely to inch up 2.7% in 2021 after sliding 3.9% in 2020. Given the growth in demand, coupled with FirstEnergy\u2019s 96.5% earnings growth this year and given that its stock is still trading 52.8% below its estimated fair value (according to Simply Wall St.), analysts speculate that its stock is set to remain a handsome mid- to long-term investment. Analysts also cite $FE\u2019s 14% return on equity (ROE) as a reassuring sign that the company is growing in value and effectively managing investors\u2019 money.

Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in each of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last: [image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ffb0c2-1e95-4b38-b913-cf5a9e81061e_2038x769.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcbd Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week after $AMD stock broke resistance above $109 per share early in the week; analysts at Benzinga say the stock has now settled into its second bullish pattern of the past month. On Wednesday, it was reported the U.S. Department of Energy was nearing a deal worth $500 million to purchase a supercomputer made with AMD and NVIDIA Corp.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Coinbase Inc. ($COIN) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week despite the stock rallying 8.62% to $278.44 per share. This increase in pessimism can be widely attributed to a handful of contrarian, negative articles published by the likes of the Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha arguing that the underlying volatility of digital assets makes Coinbase an inherently risky stock to invest in.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. ($HPE) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last as the stock remained relatively flat over the trading period, rising just 0.06% to $15.67 per share. Much of the speculation surrounding the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report released early in the week, in which the company\u2019s continued supply chain issues showed through. Analysts wonder if HP\u2019s component supply concerns will continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Moderna Inc. ($MRNA) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed after increasing in stock price by more than 13% to $416.70 per share on strong trading volume and new research released this week suggesting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 shot may offer longer-lasting protection that Pfizer\u2019s amid growing conversation about the importance (or lack thereof) of booster shots.\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis past week brought a close to the month of August and commenced the unofficial start of Fall 2021. In terms of market action, August was the 7th consecutive month of stock market growth, and the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trade volume. This past week was no exception to the tremendous momentum in both realms, and news sentiment reflected this: stock market news articles published this week saw more optimism expressed on average than any other week this year except for one (the first week of August, the height of Q2 earnings).\n\nLooking ahead into September and October, the extreme optimism is showing no signs of slowing down as Wall Street expectations for the next stock market earnings season continue to rise. Over July and August, forecasts for third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8%, according to FactSet. That\u2019s the fourth-largest such increase during the first two months of a quarter since 2009.\n\nWhile market bulls are currently reveling in the continued outperforms of stocks, market bears may be quick to point out that we are growing more and more due for some sort of correction. The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered a 5% pullback since October 2020. The last time the index experienced such a long period without a big drop was from June 2016 to early February 2018. With that in mind, we will continue to watch the progression of international economic factors like the COVID-19 Delta variant and the transition to Taliban rule in Afghanistan for any inkling of adverse impact on the U.S. stock market. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; good luck this week everyone, and thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",
