I was up 10% at one point on some positions. I got burnt the most on Paycom as I bought it at 336 a share for 3 shares before the bigs earnings drop, and now the coronavirus hit it even more. Most of these companies I only have 10 to 20 shares in though, so I'm thinking I can hold through this. However, I'm facing 20% losses with FIVE, PAYC, and FB. I've also debated getting into \"safer stocks like KO, MKC, HD, MCD, K, general mills, etc, but they dropped too, and have considerably lower growth. What would you all do keep these companies or sell with the market going the way it is?",
