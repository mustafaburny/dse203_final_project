        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Issa Falcon](https://preview.redd.it/tpzydidd7b971.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a24de00dd4c4fce80aa9b87e2bd37fea63c6724)\n\nHello I am an Ivy League Econ major who does not know how to talk to attractive women. As I type these hallowed words, I am wearing Sony XM-4s and bumping my 7 TeraByte folder of Playboi Carti leaks. Please see below my thoughts on the cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike, which trades on the Nasdaq as $CRWD.\n\nThe Kaseya ransomware attack this weekend affected 17 countries and 200 businesses. Cyberattacks are growing more and more frequent. Surely you've seen the new reports. Cyberattacks are also growing more and more sophisticated, so much so that they can even infiltrate American government agencies. The $750B the Pentagon gets every year wasn't enough to prevent that. \n\nThe consequences include breaches of sensitive user data, compromised trade secrets, corporate espionage, operational shut downs, and millions lost to paying ransoms. So, clearly, preventing these attacks is in the best interest of everyone from CEOs to Presidents to Winnie the Pooh looking ass dictators. Clearly they need to spend more. Cybersecurity products and services are going from \"nice to have\" to \"gotta get it\" status real fucking quick. \n\n**Business Model**\n\nCrowdStrike is the first of its kind among cybersecurity companies. Incumbents like Palo Alto Networks, Symantec, and even FireEye (FireEye has a lot of respect in the public sector) are all Dotcom era dinosaurs. That's because CrowdStrike is a cloud-native SaaS that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent attacks on endpoints and workloads on or off the network. That enough buzzwords for you? Forrester, Gartner, MIT, and Google (an early investor) and many other reputable sources have called CrowdStrike leader in endpoint protection.\n\n**The Bull Case**\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global [cyber security services market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cyber-security-service-market?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ICT_13-Apr-21&amp;utm_term=cyber-security-service-market&amp;utm_content=rd)\u00a0size is expected\u00a0to reach USD 192.70 billion by 2028. \n\nI say the true opportunity is even bigger, because they haven't factored in all out cyberwar between America and the evil trinity of Russia/Iran/China. State-backed cyberattacks are nothing new. Remember North Korea and Sony back when the JamesFranco-SethRogen masterpiece *The Interview* came out?  Or remember when [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/) reported that foreign hackers were trying to compromise the 2020 elections? Remember when [China agreed to invest $400B](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/27/world/middleeast/china-iran-deal.html) in Iran's tech sector?\n\nWant more proof? Just look at the [FBI's webpage](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber/news) for cyberattack press releases, there's a fuckton. [Recent research](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252499042/Nation-state-cyber-attacks-double-in-three-years) estimates that state-backed cyberattacks have doubled in the last three years.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. Geopolitical tensions continue will of course continue to heat up. This is because the human race is just a bunch of glorified, nuclear-powered apes. We will see stronger legislation mandating that businesses armor the fuck up. We will see outsized and reactionary government spending on cybersecurity. We will also likely see tax-payer funded incentives and subsidies directed toward cybsersecurity firms. \n\n**Management**\n\nWhen I worked in venture capital for a summer, I realized just how important the management team is to potential investors. And CrowdStrike lives up to all expectations in this area.\n\nGeorge Kurtz, the CEO and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike has a track record of CyberSecurity success. His startup Foundstone was acquired by McAfee in 2004, after which he worked his way up the ranks to become the CTO of McAfee. Clearly, this guy knows what the fuck he's doing. He's no sleazy salesman, he's a princely technocrat.\n\nThe Chief Strategy Officer used to be the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. I'd bet my house that this white male has many white male friends in high places. Friends who'd gladly toss him a contract or two.\n\nThe rest of the C-Suite are all cyber veterans, even the CFO. It's a who's who of hacker nerds who saw the light.\n\n**Financials**\n\nWho the fuck cares. \n\nOkay fine, I care a little. \n\nHere's an overview of Q1FY22 results: Revenue increased 70% YoY, which reflects 82% growth in subscription customers. They have a net loss of $85M only because they are investing aggressively in growth, R&amp;D. And at the end of the day they have $1.7B cash on hand to weather any shitstorms.\n\nThe customer relationships are deep and broad. Recurring revenue is over $1B. Furthermore, existing customers end up buying more and more products from CrowdStrike as time goes on. 64% of customers have now adopted four or more CrowdStrike products into their subscription. And it's not like companies who need to cut costs are going to get rid of their cybersecurity provider.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhy buy a shitass SPAC for upside? $CRWD is a litass fucking company with the world at its feet.\n\n**TLDR:** Lick lick lick my balls\n\nSources: [Most recent 10-Q](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/aad1ceb9-8336-4b26-9729-b6c1484ffc54), [Company website](https://www.crowdstrike.com), Cybersecurity news reports on Financial Times, my friends in tech and the public sector, *Mindfuck* by Christopher Wylie, *1984* by Georgei Orwellovski, *The Communist Manifesto* by Karl Marx, and -- most important of all -- the tingling in my balls\n\nPosition: Shares for now because all my liquid savings are going toward rent, but I've got a sweetass summer internship and I promise to YOLO my next paycheck into this. Buy calls, shits finna rip Tuesday.\n\n[I only wish I'd bought more](https://preview.redd.it/0v9d19giva971.jpg?width=827&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a11021f2072a291cad5d491ce9b1e15592aab7)",

Our valuation model shows that profit margins are the second most important driver of company valuations today, behind only equity duration,\" said [David Kostin](https://news.yahoo.com/stock-market-faces-two-big-headwinds-goldman-sachs-183809756.html), Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist, in a new research note to clients.\u00a0\n\nKostin outlined 32 companies spanning the health care, industrial, materials, staples and information technologies sectors that have above average net profit margins and are likely to expand them further in 2021 (see below). The median return on these stocks year-to-date has tallied 14%.\u00a0\n\n[ Some companies have outsized potential to expand profit margins this year, says Goldman Sachs. ](https://preview.redd.it/07xk6nh60ua71.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fab78e909f3124688a84696179acb6a10305bc78)\n\nSome of the top-performing stocks include Old Dominion Freight Line, NortonLifeLock, Applied Materials, Seagate Technologies and Freeport-McMoran. All of these names are seen increasing their earnings in excess of 30% this year, compared to 19% for the S&amp;P 500 (excluding financials and utilities).\u00a0\n\nAnd all of them have outperformed the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date gain of 16%. Other stocks such as Netflix and Newmont Corporation have lagged the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date performance, but could be poised to return to favor among investors amid the prospect for each company's profit margins this year (see above chart).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"S&amp;P 500 margins notched a record high of 11.9% in 1Q 2021, though investors remain focused on the forward margin outlook given rising input costs,\" Kostin explains.\u00a0\n\nStrategists are banking on more than the 32 companies outlined by Goldman to expand profit margins this year. The only question is will companies sustain those gains into 2022 given uncertainties around inflation and taxes.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is seen rising 11.2% over the next 12 months, according to analysis from FactSet. At the sector level, energy and materials are expected to show the largest gains in valuation (17.1% and 15.9%, respectively).\u00a0\n\n[***Brian Sozzi***](https://www.yahoo.com/author/brian-sozzi/) ***is an editor-at-large and*** [***anchor at Yahoo Finance***](https://finance.yahoo.com/videos/)***.
