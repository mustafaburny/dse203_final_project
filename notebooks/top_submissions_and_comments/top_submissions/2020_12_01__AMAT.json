        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|Stock Price|IV (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPY - SPDR S&amp;P 500|325B|$369.00|16%|\n|PEP - Pepsico Inc.|200B|$145.04|18%|\n|VZ - Verizon Communications|243B|$58.84|18%|\n|COST - Costco Wholesale Corp|161B|$364.69|20%|\n|PG - Procter &amp;

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663.

With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 4th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68-8FE3FRSw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.6.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCODbMH2beY))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$MTSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$DL** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$APDN** \n&gt; * **$CAMP** \n&gt; * **$SCHL** \n&gt; * **$QTT** \n&gt; * **$SCSC** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$RFIL** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$NAV**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663.

With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 11th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOBjxtu9Ago))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.13.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHqwuwWaaI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$MTSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$DL** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$APDN** \n&gt; * **$CAMP** \n&gt; * **$SCHL** \n&gt; * **$QTT** \n&gt; * **$SCSC** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$RFIL** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$NAV**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\nIf you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the \"next earnings date\" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|Stock Price|IV (%)|Next Earnings Date|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VZ - Verizon Communications Inc|250B|$60.38|16%|N/A|\n|SPY - SSgA Active Trust - SSGA SPDR S&amp;P 500|320B|$366.09|17%|N/A|\n|PG - Procter &amp;

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 4th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68-8FE3FRSw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.6.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCODbMH2beY))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$MTSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$DL** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$APDN** \n&gt; * **$CAMP** \n&gt; * **$SCHL** \n&gt; * **$QTT** \n&gt; * **$SCSC** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$RFIL** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$NAV**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 11th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOBjxtu9Ago))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.13.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHqwuwWaaI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$MTSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$DL** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$APDN** \n&gt; * **$CAMP** \n&gt; * **$SCHL** \n&gt; * **$QTT** \n&gt; * **$SCSC** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$RFIL** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$NAV**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "*#Clown Market DD:*# Buckle up buckaroos I'm gonna show you how to wine and dine on tendies at Wendys this very Wednesday. Neither Bull, nor Bear, I am full-on Clown and this is my native market. Given the recent Clownish trends, which unequivocally guarantee future results (*cf.* \"New Paradigm\" inflection point of [Figure A](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=9035), the contents of Airbnb's S-1 disclosure statement (available [here](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-306257/)) and other SEC filings (available [here](https://sec.report/CIK/0001559720)) are completely irrelevant, like seatbelts on a seadoo. \n\n**TLDR;** Imagine an amount of money you are willing to lose and then double it. Buy ABNB at Fidelity on IPO day, shares on Wednesday afternoon, and calls the following week.\n\nNow before you parade down the street blasting your kazoo, let's go over WHY to buy. UBER IPO'd last year at $41. This was a typical case of insider investors realizing their shares of a shitty, unprofitable company were better off in the hands of retail mothershmuckers. UBER has become even less profitable in the interim, so naturally the stock price has risen to $54. Now some of you bigbrains might be furrowing your fiveheads--ABNB has a clear path to profitability and has indeed [turned a profit](https://www.cnet.com/news/airbnb-first-profit-home-rental-travel-startups/) on multiple occasions. My elf ears hear you ask:\n\n&gt;\"Under Clownmarket rules doesn't this mean ABNB will trade flat like a boomer bond?\" \n\n\"Nein!\" is my reply. Fear not, for ABNB posted a [$322m loss](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/12/21134477/airbnb-loss-profit-ipo-safety-tech-marketing) last year. Although it's not as sexy as [TSLA's $862m loss](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272130/net-loss-of-tesla/) in the same year, we can hope ABNB's costs of expanding into China will swell like an ass-eater's lymph nodes. The analysts certainly think so. Cordwell has a price target of [$75 a share](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ABNB/price-target/) following the likely $45-$50 IPO target.\n\nAlthough Airbnb is clearly just Uber for your mattress, some skeptics demand more metrics. Compare Booking.com (BKNG) which IPO'd at $483.99 in 1999 and dropped to $7.88 by 2001. Could this happen to ABNB? Absolutely not. Why? Because I got bedbugs once at a booking.com dive with fake pics, and I didn't even call their customer service to get my eleven dollars back. Contrast that with when I got kicked out of an Airbnb in Bali six years ago, I got on the phone with a **specialist** who **investigated** my **case** and gave me a bunch of store credit for shit I didn't even ask for. Add in the fact that BKNG now trades at $2125 and you've got yourself a real *fuck it why not* scenario.  \n\nAnd finally, *Google Trends* [shows \"airbnb\" is half as hype as \"tesla\"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=airbnb,tesla) which logically puts ABNB at 50% of TSLA's $558b valuation, =$279b, which would put ABNB's share price at $465.\n\nPut the kazoos away boys, this 10-bagger calls for a fanfaronade of vuvuzelas!",

S&amp;P\u2019s clients will be able to work with the index provider to create customized indices and other benchmarking tools on cryptocurrencies, S&amp;P and Lukka said in a joint statement.  S&amp;P and Lukka hope more reliable pricing data will make it easier for investors to access the new asset class, and reduce some of the risks of the very volatile and speculative market, they said.\n\n&gt; \u201cWith digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,\u201d said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The move by one of the world\u2019s most well-known index providers could help cryptocurrencies become more mainstream investments. It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, boosted by increased demand from investors who say the virtual currency is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin was trading at $19,300 in latest trading on Thursday, having soared around 170% this year. Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but have started attracting more interest from large financial companies over the last few years.\n\n&gt; Large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan\u2019s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, while major exchanges have started offering bitcoin derivatives. The emergence of more mainstream market infrastructure has made the asset class more accessible for institutional investors, with hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller saying they include bitcoin in their broad investment strategies.",

The absolute *worst* thing that can happen is that your shares get swapped to Hong Kong's stock exchange. The article explained that Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, and Schwab, for example, already offer retail traders like us access to HK's exchange.\n\nGranted that NIO and XPEV are not on the Hong Kong exchange yet. But they have three years to comply with the US rule. That's plenty of time to secure a spot on the Hong Kong exchange. And Hong Kong would *love* to have them. This move could also benefit the companies themselves, as it makes them available to both American *and* Chinese investors:\n\n&gt;A Hong Kong listing means a company\u2019s stock can be traded during the Asian day and is likely to broaden its investor base.

I know it takes several days to get verified and actually start investing. \n\nAlso which companies are good for beginners like me? My peers say a bunch of different companies but I\u2019m not sure which ones to look into but I always hear Tesla being mentioned. \n\nOverall I\u2019m still a bit confused and I\u2019d really appreciate any info.

Why is it a range?)\n\nSo if I were to buy this contract, it would be an option to sell x100 shares of MSTR at 310 up until 1/15/21, and it would cost $3,665 (the median of the spread?)?\n\nIs that accurate so far?\n\nIf so, let\u2019s say on 1/15/21 that MSTR is at 300.  A difference of $10 x 100 shares for $1000 is far less than the $3,665 I mentioned above though, so a net loss.\n\nIn fact, by my math MSTR would have to drop to 273 to break even. (Is that right, or am I mistaken on the premium?)\n\nLastly..exercise vs. sell: I assume the vast majority of the time I would want to sell the contract rather than exercise.  \n\nSell: what kind of basis would the contract sell for?  Is there a good way to estimate before entering into a contract?\n\nExercise: if you don\u2019t own shares of a put contract, how would you exercise it?

        "selftext": "I just had a rather frustrating call with TDA. I've been tinkering with options for a little under a year now. I started on fidelity selling CC's against a large position I owned. I also opened an account at TDA that was intended for more active options trading when that CC finally hit at Fidelity, since Fidelity's website is kinda wonky for options trading.\n\nWhen I opened the account at TDA, I selected options access, margin, futures, forex, margin, advanced features, etc. After opening the account, I saw that literally none of those were on the account (!). I called them, and they stated that they were approved and would show up the next day. Some did, some didn't. Options *looked* like it was.\n\nI've been daytrading stocks in the account in the interim. Not too bad either - doubled the account. Well, fast forward to this morning. I tried purchasing a 2022 LEAP with the intention of doing PMCCs, and I got an error that \"it would create an illegal position\" error (!!).\n\nSo, I get on the phone with TDA and they tell me that I was never approved for options (!!!). I explain the history. They say they don't see it (!!!!). They also say that during the application, the request for additional account features was never filled out (!!!!!), which is BS because I literally picked through it with a fine tooth comb.\n\nOk, fine. So I re-apply. This time, they only give me L1 options, and some L2. No ability to do spreads.\n\nAnd I'm locked there for another 90 days. After 3 attempts to enable options at my desired level now - at creation, after creation, and now this, I give TF up. I told the rep that I'm probably going to close the account since I have L3 options at fidelity, spreads were part of my strategy, and they gave me some spiel about \"well its for your own safety, we are much more strict than fidelity, we want you to have more experience, we aren't trying to win your business.\" (!!!!!!!)\n\nAt that line, I said \"well done then.\" and hung up.\n\nI'll pull my cash back out and either move back to Fidelity (though I hate their website for options trading, and I don't have a machine where I can run active trader pro). I've also heard a lot of love towards tastyworks, but the commissions see really high. I wanted to avoid RH because of really bad experiences there as an early user. I've also heard some love towards webull.\n\nI get there's an obligation to \"protect me from myself\" but GD this is frustrating when I already have that level of access elsewhere, and was told by their support that I was approved. It's even more frustrating when it feels like support is trying to gaslight you, and then waves you off like you aren't important when you point it out.",

I\u2019ve paid myself a \u2018reasonable salary\u2019 this year. I have my Roth IRA in Fidelity, and I made the maximum contribution in early January. My personal ST gains from stock this year is around $200K (2000% YTD). I just realized that I will exceed the income contribution limit for Roth IRA. I spoke to Fidelity about this issue and they have given me two options: either withdraw the contribution and get penalized plus taxes at ordinary or do a conversion to traditional and then back to Roth IRA plus file Form 8606 every year.\n\nAs of right now, my Roth IRA has a 95% YTD return. Although I understand that this return may not be consistent and be lucky, and that I may have to rebalance as I get older, I still want to be able to aggressive and choose my own positions. Playing around with the compound interest calculator: maximum annual contribution, 15-20% average yield, and a 30 year period, this is a no brainer on after-tax savings. \n\nI specifically want a after-tax option to invest. Is the best way to continue funding traditional Roth and then convert every year or to open a Roth 401K employer side and fund it ($19K contribution limit?)?

My plan is investing ~$600 every month for the next 5 years and I need to cash out after that.

I use Fidelity platform for investing. \n\nSo I ended up with the next \n50% VOO\n30% QQQ\n5% ARKK\n5% ARKG\n5% ICLN\n5% QCLN\nAnd something else.\n\nVOO and QQQ seems like overlapping. Had a hard time deciding between VTI and VOO.\n\nWhat do you think about that? How aggressive is this? Should I go more aggressive?

        "selftext": "Between a recent inheritance, and cash I've been stockpiling in a savings account, I have \\~$325k cash collecting dust. I need your help! lol. I'm 40, no kids, no financial obligations. This money  is growing rapidly based on my income, at the rate of $5-10k/month. I need to put this money to work, and would really appreciate input from you all - especially people who've been in a similar situation where they've come into a large sum unexpectedly and didn't have prior experience with money on that scale. For context, I'm self-employed, and I've been maxing out my retirement contributions annually (in terms of the maximum I can contribute to have a tax advantage). I've even had crazy luck with my retirement account, it's up \\~25% on the year. I earn roughly $200k/yr, and COVID has not, and will not impact business (it's growing). I've put together roughly \\~450k in net worth in the past three years, starting at ground zero, so in relative terms all of this wealth is new. Other than my mortgage I'm debt free - my mortgage is 2.99 % fixed for 30 years, so paying this down doesn't seem like the right move, at least not right now.\n\nSome questions:\n\n* has anyone navigated this type of situation recently?\n* does anyone have experience having their savings/retirement actively managed? Fidelity offers this for a reasonable monthly fee\n* can I trust financial advisors? any 'tells' I can watch out for?\n* are there any mistakes / pitfalls you guys have made that you could help me avoid?\n* should I wait until after the transition of power before making any moves? politics aside, these are dicey times and whatever is going to happen will transpire by the end of next month\n* can anyone recommend effective means of giving? I'd like to take a slice of ROI and get that to people who need it. I read that 1 in 5 kids here is hungry, and that's criminal\n* Whether that's cash or gold bricks, I'm going to make a 'doomsday fund' to keep at home - I'm not a prepper, but banks have failed, once in my lifetime - can someone give some advice on this? Was thinking \\~10k in cash/gold\n\nMy goals:\n\n* would prefer this to be relatively hands off - get some safety nets in place (stop loss etc), stick to relatively boring equities, etc etc. my income is such I don't have to get aggressive here\n* early retirement - I'd love to scale back to a 3 day work ASAP, and I'm not materialistic - there will be no Mercedes in the driveway, no vacations in St. Tropez, it's just not my style\n* real estate - I'd like to expand into rental properties, I'm in the St. Pete FL area and there's no shortage of people looking to rent\n\nANY advice you all could share would truly be appreciated. Criticism/suggestion regarding my current thoughts and plans is also welcomed. I've done really well recently, but it's amateur hour and I'm aware of this. PLEASE share any mistakes major mistakes you've made in similar situations - IMO the best thing I can do is avoid common pitfalls, but I'm looking to do more than drop this into gov't bonds.\n\nThank you!",
