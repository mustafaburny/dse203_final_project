        "selftext": "Apparently 70% of crypto movements have been \"wash trading\".  \nsource: [https://www.cber-forum.org/cryptowashtrading](https://www.cber-forum.org/cryptowashtrading)\n\nWhat is Wash trading?\n\nA crypto currency/coin is just an crypto secured code. Does nothing. Just cryptographed code.  \nSo you see the listed market price for a coin?\n\nBasically you can make them go up or down with bidding a higher price then the listed price and executing the trade. (establishing a new market price)\n\nSo someone launches a coin, then they open two or several accounts. And they simply buy the coin, by moving money from one account to the other. Pushing up the listed market price... So it was worth 0$ then now they've moved it up as much as they could with all the money they had.  \nObviously, if the market price gets high enough they can no longer afford to move the price up past $100 if they can only move $100 back and forth between two accounts, buying and selling it.\n\nSomeone else see the market price and says wowwww the price is going up I better buy. Then they simply sell them coins at the price. It gains momentum when people keep buying into it then when the price is high enough and they see not much more people are buying into it, they simply selll allllllll the coins they have stored pushing the price down to 0 to capture all of pending bid prices. And leaving people who bought these \"coins\" with a code with a listed market value of 0.  \nThis is essentially how \"rug pulls\" work. (i.e. the Squid Game token going to 0 and countless others)\n\nBut is bitcoin/ethereum etc. operating the same way????  \nHere is a live trading dashboard of bitcoin: [https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC\\_USDT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT)  \nSee how trades are being executed multiple times a second, setting the listed price. I believe it is the same but on a much wider scale.\n\nLook here, at one point, bitcoin crashed to 8k from 65k, because one of their traders \"made a mistake\". source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-briefly-crashed-87-8-143639198.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-briefly-crashed-87-8-143639198.html)\n\nMore evidence of wash trading of bitcoin here, notice how bitcoin/ethereum listed price move in lockstep despite being \"completely different coins with completely different real world applications\" ? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41\\_uZD9miZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41_uZD9miZw)\n\nThey need you to buy into it for a reason. Hence, the heavily promoted lies, and aggressive marketing. Of course, they seem to need you to buy but never sell.\n\nWhen the price of bitcoin/ethereum tanked hard, a lot of these exchanges literally shutdown, there by locking people out of their accounts, preventing these people from selling and effectively stealing people's money... They've (coin base, kraken, kukoo etc.) have done this numerous times this year.\n\nSo I ask, if you're \"investing\" in this heavily marketed, energy draining, digital code, with no real world benefit to the economy are you really just playing the game - buy in and dump on others before the people with large amounts of money can dump on you or is there some kind of real economic driver driving up the price of these coins?",

So theoretically, you don\u2019t need to touch your principal amount, which becomes a safety net.\n* The 50\u201330\u201320 rule states states that of your income, 50% should be spent on your needs, 30% - on your wants, and 20% - on your savings.\n* Your investments in equity should be equal to 100% minus your age - because these markets are always growing long term, and it would allow you to get the maximum value of your savings with proper investments.",

Visa authorized an increase in theirs last week, with Mastercard doing the same yesterday. Mastercard has also approved a new $8B share repurchase program.\n\n**Visa and Amazon Dispute**\n\nFor Amazon in the U.K, Visa cards only account for 7% of transactions, the smallest share of all card purchases. Amazon U.K primarily uses Mastercard for payments. For Amazon in the US, Visa is the dominant card.\n\nThey have specifically targeted the country that would impact them the least. Visa has also faced much more impactful restrictions from companies such as Walmart and Kroger and they ended up settling those disputes privately. It's clearly just a negotiation tactic from Amazon.\n\n**Interest Rate Risk**\n\nThese companies derive revenue from client services, data processing, cross-border transactions, and value-added services, such as licensing fees. Meaning they have less exposure to interest-rate risk as they neither earn revenue from or bear any risk tied to the interest or fees paid by cardholders.",

        "selftext": "TSX-V: GRID\n\nTantalus Systems develops and delivers purpose-built smart grid solutions for public power and electric cooperative utilities. They address the growing $4.7 billion market opportunity in public power and electric cooperative utilities. Tantalus supports over 200 utility across North America and the Caribbean basin with a 99% retention rate. \n\ntheir goal is to gitize the distribution grid, currently power grids have one way power flow with no intelligence at the end. Tantalus\u2019 solution is an integrated smart grid with multi directional power flow and digital connections to intelligent endpoints. They aim to improve the efficiency, reliability and sustainability of utilities and the communities they serve. transforming the energy infrastructure is a multi decade market opportunity for Tantalus. \n\nWhen they get hired by a public utility for example, the first thing they do is build out a proprietary internet of things (IoT) communication networks specifically for the utility. Then they can connect that utility to a variety of different devices with a distributed edge computing platform. The devices they connect to include electric meters, load control switches that turn on and off A/C, distribution automation equipment, and also street lighting infrastructure. They use the data from the devices they connect to to help the utility gain understandings in their grid, where they need to invest in infrastructure, and how to prepare for events like extreme weather. \n\nThey\u2019ve posted 18 consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA with a 7 year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8%. They posted a negative quarterly EBITDA for the first time in 4 years in Q3 after the costs associated with going public. They finished the quarter with a strong balance sheet, holding US$14.6 million in cash and US$32.9 million in assets.\n\nI think this company is in a good place, they solve a really common problem, as was evident in the US this year when a big cold front hit the south cause major outages and shutting down electrical grids. They recently went public and raised a ton of cash which will be huge in scaling their business.

        "selftext": "TSX-V: LORD OTCQB: LRDJF FSE: BVU3\n\nSt. James Gold Corp. is a gold focused mining company, they\u2019re well funded, have huge land assets, and exploration on their mineral properties has been really positive. They trade at CAD$1.5 with a market cap of $33 million, share price has decreased this last month and I think it\u2019s a big dip for a company with huge upside. Their flagship property is the Florin Gold project in the Yukon with an inferred resource of 2.47 million ounces of gold.\n\nRecently they completed their 2021 drill exploration program on the Florin Gold Project in the Yukon Territory. They also had a successful capital raise for $10 million giving them a sizeable war chest o complete exploration and begin drilling. They also listed on the FSE and OTCQB markets and began exploration activities on their Newfoundland claims. \n\nThey had to upsize their latest private placement because of investor demand in the company, with 22% held by insiders I think it shows their confidence in their property in the Yukon and the really promising Newfoundland claims. The capital raise gave them enough cash to bring the Florin Gold project to production and finance their exploration on their Newfoundland claims without needing to dilute shareholders with another capital raise anytime soon. \n\nThey\u2019re conducting a prospecting drive that should help St. James understand the mechanisms that concentrate higher grades of mineralization around their Florin Gold project. On top of that they have another option where to acquire 85% interest in the historical Tintina gold belt in the Yukon, an area covering almost 22,000 acres.\n\nSt. James has a lot of potential in Newfoundland, they have the option to acquire 100% interest in 29 different claims covering 1,791 acres in north-central Newfoundland. They also own another option to acquire 100% interest in 28 claims covering 1,730 acres, further south in central Newfoundland.\n\nReally like this company, the whole mining industry is really undervalued and hasn\u2019t been getting a lot of attention from investors. I see them trading at a discount to their actual value just because they haven\u2019t had a ton of investor exposure but this is a solid company with really promising properties and tons more claims to expand their gold resource.\n\nNot investment advice, always do your own research.",

A few months ago I bought $V LEAPs because it already looked at a discount and I committed to a long term rebound... boy was I wrong (so far)! My LEAPs are now down ~65% and I'm looking for a way to recoup a bit of unrealized losses. I plan on holding these LEAPs a bit so thought I'd try my hand at some PMCCs since I've not done that before! I've sold calls before on positions of 100 shares but never on a LEAP.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) is it alright to sell a call that's of lesser strike price than my LEAP? I'd guess yes it's fine, but idk if that would cause some weird issue.\n\n2) if exercised, will the brokerage (in my case Fidelity)  automatically then use the LEAP as collateral or would I need to manually do that and be at a margin call until I do so? \n\nThanks, these are probably terrible questions and I've watched plenty of YouTube videos from TastyTrade and InTheMoney and other decent sources on this, I've read about it extensively, I'm just a bit of an overworrier and want to double verify and cover my bases.\n\nThanks!",

In June, CEO Adam Miron, who co-founded cannabis giant Hexo before joining Brane as chairman of its board of directors in 2019, told the Ottawa Business Journal that the \u201ctime is right\u201d to take the company public as it pursues its goal of becoming a qualified custodian of crypto. At the time, he expected the company to debut on the TSX-V this fall, which leads me to believe we will see them go public very soon.\n\nBrane serves to protect and store cryptocurrency assets such as bitcoin in an effort to keep them secure from hackers. They have developed patented technology that is among the few in the sector certified to ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and NIST CSF tier 4 standards \u2013 the highest practical levels of assurance for information security. They have an agreement with Computershare Trust Company, one of the most trusted corporate trust companies, to provide secure offline cold storage for Brane's clients. Computershare has CAD $18.2 billion in assets under administration and serves some of the biggest corporations in North America.\n\n\"Brane's cryptocurrency custody technology is built for financial institutions, and that's why we provide the highest standards of security and redundancy for our clients,\" said Dave Revell, Brane board member and former Global Chief Information Officer at CIBC.\n\nThe only other qualified custodian for digital tokens Canadians can turn to is Gemini, a New York-based cryptocurrency exchange, however, trusting a foreign entity to store investments poses a security risk of its own. Hackers have compromised many cryptocurrency exchanges; 76,000 investors lost money in the collapse of the Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX in 2019.\n\nDMG Blockchain strategically invested $3.0m in Brane back in June (8.0 million units of Brane at a unit price of $0.375 per unit). \u201cBrane Vault is the best user experience I\u2019ve seen for a multiple signature wallet, coupled with security best practices, and a technology approach that is native bitcoin to the core.\" Stated Adrian Glover, DMG\u2019s CTO.\n\nThey also have been certified operationally carbon neutral by Carbonzero. This certification confirms Brane's purchase of carbon offsets for its 2020 operations, which will support the Ontario Biodiversity Afforestation Project in Northern Ontario. Carbonzero has been a North American industry leader in greenhouse gas measurement, reduction, and offsetting solutions for more than 15 years - working with leading Canadian and international brands to measure their corporate emissions and set bold and ambitious GHG emissions reduction strategies.\n\n\"As a crypto custody provider, Brane's business is built on trust, sustainability, and safeguarding the interests of our clients and the public,\" said Patrick McLaughlin, Brane's Founder. \"Our carbon neutral certification in partnership with Carbonzero is a key step in providing environmentally responsible custody solutions to the cryptocurrency market, and provides Brane with valuable baseline data to offset and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nVery much looking forward to this company going public.\n\nAlways do your own research, this is not investing advice!",

        "selftext": "Billionaire investor: Democrats' plan to tax stock buybacks is 'literally insane'  https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/investing/charlie-munger-buybacks-tax/index.html\n\nTLDR: Washington now wants to tax buybacks. \n\nThis might be the dumbest idea I have ever heard. It will cause a chilling effect on stock buybacks, which will in turn hurt investors. My fear is that in an effort to \u201ctax the rich\u201d Washington will crush those trying to build wealth. As we have seen through covid, trickle up economics does not work and is indeed catastrophic. What history does show however is that trickle down economics does work, to a degree. I understand that it\u2019s popular right now to chide trickle down economics, but the reality is, it works. It\u2019s real. When the rich do well, we all do well. When the poor do well, we get inflation. Obviously I am grossly over simplifying the issues and being a bit hyperbolic but my Point is this\u2014policies designed the make the rich pay their fair share will inevitable and intrinsically harm those working filling entry to build wealth. Taxing buybacks could potentially topple the stock market. So where are us young responsible folks supposed to invest our savings? Home prices and real estate are through the roof thanks to shorty lending policies; the stock market is teetering on the edge with all of these insane new policies but nothing to actually reign in the bad actors; and everyone is telling us that v-currency is bad . . . So where do us responsible young folks invest? How do we save for our futures? Can\u2019t even put money in a bank right now bc of inflation.

        "selftext": "To preface this, I'm only advising this for young investors, 18-25.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of reddit is quick to recommend you throw all of your money into an ETF, but I disagree. In my opinion, ETFs are more for preserving wealth. Individual stocks is where you gain that wealth. When you're at a young age, your risk tolerance should be way higher than when you're in your 40s. I'm not saying gamble your money on a high-risk penny stock, but you should be putting most of your portfolio in individual stocks. Find a few sectors you like, and find companies within those sectors that have historically performed well and have positive earnings growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will take 5 sectors and compare popular stocks within those sectors against the 1-year performance of the S&amp;P500 \n\nEnergy: \n\nXOM - 52%\n\nCVX - 28%\n\nCOP - 72%\n\nMRO - 151%\n\nSU - 45%\n\nTotal 1yr performance : 69%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndustrials:\n\nLPX - 94%\n\nSEB - 17%\n\nOC - 20%\n\nBLDR - 104%\n\nNLSN - 15%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 51%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancial:\n\nMA - (-5%)\n\nSOFI - 57%\n\nAXP - 27%\n\nPYPL - (12%)\n\nV - (5%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 12%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShipping:\n\nZIM - 376%\n\nSBLK - 157%\n\nGOGL - 125%\n\nTGH - 87%\n\nSTNG - 12%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 151%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnology:\n\nNVDA - 139%\n\nNFLX - 24%\n\nAMD - 63%\n\nNET - 124%\n\nINTC - (3%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 70%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Total 1yr performance of all these stocks combined: 71%**\n\n**Total 1yr performance of the S&amp;P500: 25%**\n\nPicking individual stocks nearly tripled the performance of the S&amp;P500 over the course of a year. While you did take on more risk, this should be considered encouraged at a younger age. As you get older you should gradually move portions of your portfolio over to more blue chips and ETFs. Anyways, I constantly see people saying only to put stocks into ETFs, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts.",

        "selftext": "**Not financial advice.**\n\n**Purpose**: To discuss with random people my process of timing the market, and to point out any other signals that I might be missing.\n\n**Why people think you cannot time the market:**\n\n* *Daily weekly and monthly (Short Term) changes in price are hypothesized to be random:*[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random\\_walk\\_hypothesis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis)*Visual youtube description:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4uFZBPr6b4*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4uFZBPr6b4) *(Another analogy is predicting the weather with imperfect data)*\n* *You cannot time the market on a yearly trend if you do not have price targets about what you want to buy and sell.*\n* *You cannot time the market if you are impulsive. If you set your targets, you need to respect them, despite your emotions.*\n* *You cannot time the market if you do not know the characteristics of the asset over correction, or full bear market scenarios. (Does the asset respect the 10, 50, 100, or 200 day Simple Moving Average.)*\n\n\\*\\*Summary of the above:\\*\\*Even if you are correct, short term movements may still be random, and so your price targets will need to account for that by being conservative. That is to say, if you think the price could reach $6000, then you should \u201csettle\u201d for, say, 30% less depending on the asset held.\n\nSo now I\u2019ve established that I am only timing on yearly trends, let\u2019s take a look at an example. Taking the most recent downturn in the markets we had 3 factors working against us:\n\n* *Tax loss harvesting.*\n* *Omicron*\n* *Tapering*\n\nA **tax loss harvesting** phenomena happens every year, but **is not going to result in a downturn every year**, and as such I believe it to be minor influence on price action.\n\n**Omicron**. Everyone is debating right now the full impact. All we knew was there were a lot of mutations on the protein spike. Delta had 18 mutations, while Omicron was reported to have 43.Given that Delta was able to infect \\~15% vaccinated individuals we can assume the same or worse for Omicron given vaccines are monoclonal. **The biggest factor is how policy makers react**. If lockdowns are even considered, we can expect a 2020-esque downturn. (*You had to piece all this together within 5 days of the news coming out by the way.*)\n\nThe last bit of news was **tapering**. You would need to know a couple things here:\n\n1. First you need to know the [risk curve of asset classes.](https://quaystreet.com/-/media/quaystreet/images/content/articles-pages/risk-profile/riskreturnchart.gif)\n2. Second, you would need to know **how yields on bonds affect the right side of the risk curve** negatively, (cr\\*pto, vc, and small caps.) This is a decent predictor that things will be pretty bad for any \u201crisky\u201d asset.It was my assumption that taken together all 3, we have a decent chance that we would see a modest correction at best, to 2020 style correction at worst if policy makers try to lockdown again.\n\nIn summary. Putting this all together took a lot of time, every day, an hour at minimum and **unless you\u2019re thinking about it all and know how everything works, you would not have gotten out in time.**\n\nLastly, if you did short, buy puts, or hold cash, is there anything you saw not listed that moved you to do so? If you did, what was it?\n\nAnd for fun, predict the correction. I\u2019ll start with it\u2019s now entirely dependent on policy makers. I won\u2019t be buying back in until I see the stocks I am looking at move above the 10d SMA.\n\nHow about yourselves?",

(if even a fraction is found at either its a big success).\n\nPage 5 also states: The Best estimates reported represent that ***there is a 50% probability that the actual resource volume will be in excess of the amounts reported.***\n\nPage 5 also states: There is greater than 50% chance that if a discovery is made, it will be commercialised.

I think the vast majority of major discoveries have already been made.\n\nWe are in a very unique position with this play, and an amazing balance of risk vs reward. To top it off, millions of dollars have been spent here to obtain and certify the data on the prospective resources. (nothing is guaranteed, ofcourse - but i definitely want to stick around and be apart of it). You've got to risk it for the biscuit.\n\n*\"Invictus prospective resource has been independently certified by both Getech and NSAI - its not just large, its elephant scale. So for those not familiar with the terminology elephant scale is resources of 1 billion barrells of oil equivalent or more. So 9TCF is about double the size of the Pluto Gas Fields in WA (Western  Australia) - and (to put this in perspective) Waitsia in WA which has been the largest onshore gas discovery in Austraila for 40 years is just under 1TCF. Not only is there a lot of gas but potentially a lot of liquid associated with it aswell - so condensate which is a form of oil.\"*\n\n# Preliminary Seismic Results  (NOV 2021)\n\n[https://hotcopper.com.au/documentembed?id=uOMxKKzFkiWRTLKhOROKAxjvTDYL4wi%2ByhP%2Fv%2F5v5bFiGug%3D](https://hotcopper.com.au/documentembed?id=uOMxKKzFkiWRTLKhOROKAxjvTDYL4wi%2ByhP%2Fv%2F5v5bFiGug%3D)\n\nThere are quite a few youtube interviews / videos / podcasts with the company if you would like to get a better understanding.

Background**\n\nFor those of you that are not aware of this company, simply put they are a small biotech based out of Maryland. Prior to March of 2020 they developed experimental vaccines for Ebola, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other emerging infectious diseases. Please note 'influenza' is where they had been working heavily prior to the covid-19 outbreak. In fact they had been working on Nanoflu (in a nut shell is a more effective flu shot) which has shown to provide very effective immune responses. When the world shut down and we got hit with the rona they were in a good position to pivot and begin working on a vaccine to save the world. You might wonder what is taking them so long? Simply put, being a very small company with limited capital and resources they couldn't compete with Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, or Moderna who just so happen to be dominating the current market. However, the snails pace development allowed them create a safer and more effective vaccine versus the mRNA competition. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How does the Novavax vaccine work?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Novavax COVID-19 vaccine contains a protein (made using moth cells) plus an adjuvant (made from tree bark). An adjuvant is an ingredient added to boost a person's immune response, creating higher levels of antibodies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Novavax vaccine uses a telltale piece of the coronavirus: the notorious spike protein. All alone, the spike protein is harmless and can't cause COVID-19. When your immune system encounters the lonely spike protein, it produces antibodies against it. This gives you protection against future COVID-19 infection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Unlike mRNA vaccines, the spike protein is already premade in the Novavax vaccine. It's a shortcut,\" explains Dr. Florescu. \"All the synthesis happens outside the body and we just give the end product: the spike protein.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike other COVID-19 vaccines, Novavax does not cause COVID-19 infection. It can't get you sick. This vaccine doesn't contain either live or inactivated virus.\n\nHow did they get the spike protein?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Novavax method uses moth cells to make spike proteins: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResearchers select the desired genes that create certain SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein). \n\nResearchers put the genes into a baculovirus, an insect virus.\n\nThe baculovirus infects moth cells and replicates inside them.\n\nThese moth cells create lots of spike proteins.\n\nResearchers extract and purify the spike proteins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The Novavax vaccine has no genetic material, only proteins,\" says Dr. Florescu. \"The vaccine technology is more traditional, and it's very similar to a protein-based influenza vaccine.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInfluenza vaccines have also used this moth cell factory method.\n\nWhat does the adjuvant (soapbark tree extract) do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdjuvants increase the immune response to a vaccine. In this vaccine, soapbark tree extract adjuvant makes achieving immunity possible with a smaller dose of the spike protein.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMatrix-M is the adjuvant used by Novavax. It is based on a saponin extracted from the soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria). The soapbark extract encourages immune cells to activate, generating a more potent immune response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSaponins are found naturally in various plant species like beans and green peas. They're used in agriculture, animal feeds, veterinary vaccines and human food. Saponins can boost immune responses to proteins. Using the Matrix-M adjuvant, a smaller dose of spike protein achieves the desired immune response. \n\nsource: [https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/moths-and-tree-bark-how-the-novavax-vaccine-works](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/moths-and-tree-bark-how-the-novavax-vaccine-works)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So just how effective was their vaccine in trials?**\n\nNovavax is another highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. Infectious diseases expert Diana Florescu, MD, led the phase 3 clinical trial of the Novavax vaccine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). \"It's rewarding to help the development of a new vaccine,\" she says. \"The research group was excited to bring this study to our community to help curb the pandemic.\"\n\n**Results of the clinical trial**\n\n93% effective against predominantly circulating variants: Against the alpha (B.1.1.7) and beta (B.1.351) variants, plus other variants of concern/variants of interest, Novavax had 93% efficacy. The Novavax vaccine had 100% efficacy against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.\n\nVery good protection against mild disease: Novavax's overall vaccine efficacy was 90.4%. All cases in the vaccine group were mild.\n\nFull protection against severe disease: The Novavax vaccine had 100% efficacy against moderate and severe disease.\n\n**Side effects**\n\nCommon side effects were injection site pain and tenderness, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. These typically lasted less than three days.\n\n**Who was in the clinical trial?**\n\nOver 29,000 people participated in the trial. UNMC was one of 113 sites in the United States. \"We're grateful to all participants for their help,\" says Dr. Florescu. \"Major medical breakthroughs could not happen without the generosity of the trial participants.\"\n\n\"People were so enthusiastic to participate,\" says Dr. Florescu. \"One family included every family member in the trial. Grandparents, parents and children \u2013 all three generations \u2013 took part in it.\" Thirteen percent were older than 65, a high-risk age group for severe COVID-19.\n\n**The trial also included people from multiple backgrounds:**\n\n20% Latino/Latina\n\n12% African American\n\n7% Native American\n\n5% Asian American\n\nsource: [https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/novavax-vaccine-results-how-effective-is-it-against-variants](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/novavax-vaccine-results-how-effective-is-it-against-variants)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Market Opportunities**\n\nNovavax is targeting distribution to lower/middle income nations first. Why? Because their vaccine is extremely cheap to make unlike the mRNA vaccines and they are actually looking to stop the spread. Plus they know the mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) vaccines are not working. The world population is 7.9 billion people and right now only 42.7% are fully vaccinated with a vaccine that doesn't even work and can potentially cause severe side effects. That leaves about 4.5 billion people who have not received a vaccine. And don't forget that boosters are being pushed now. So in theory at minimum that is 3 doses per person approximately 13.5 billion doses (for those that have not been vaccinated). Now of course it's safe to assume a good percent won't receive any vaccine ever and Pfizer/Moderna will still receive a big chunk, but even a small 20% cut could lead to billions in profit for NVAX. And if those that have been vaccinated opt for the NVAX booster that's an additional 3.4 billion people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow will this small biotech manufacture enough doses? Well they are ramping up and have the capacity at minimum to produce 200 million doses per month. The manufacturing capacity in place is as follows (these numbers add up to well over 4 bil per year and reflect max capacity):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSerum Institute of India (SII) - 2 billion doses annually\n\nNovavax CZ - 1 billion doses annually\n\nFujifilm Diosynth US - 300 million annually \n\nTakeda Pharmaceutical - 250 million annually\n\nSK Bioscience - 150 million annually\n\nFujifilm Diosynth UK - 180 million annually\n\nBiofabri - 100 million annually\n\nMabion - 120 million annually\n\nNational Research Council - 24 million annually\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe US provided NVAX with $1.6 billion in exchange for 100 million doses in 2020 as part of Operation Warp Speed which puts a price tag of $16 per dose. I am thinking that this is on the higher end and the rest of the world would probably bring an average price to around $10 (my guess ). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo at a minimum of 200 million per month at $10 that's $24 billion in revenue which should at least double the current market cap of 12.2 billion bringing the share price to around $324. As of right now there are multiple price targets hovering around the $305 mark from actual analysts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf they are manufacturing and selling 4.1 billion doses annually (as indicated above) we could see revenue in the $41 billion area. That would bring it to a share price of around $544. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNaturally, I'm bullish as fuck on this company and I think we will soon see half the market cap of Moderna who NVAX was initially running toe to toe with in producing the vaccine. At a market cap of $61 billion the share price would be around $809.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's be honest, the covid shit isn't going away and I would be willing to bet that it will become a seasonal thing similarly to the flu. Fortunately, Novavax has had success coupling their covid-19 vaccine with Nanoflu. This would be the ultimate kill 2 birds with one stone cocktail that most people would prefer to take and could be a catalyst for the stock price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. The Conspiracy Theory**\n\nSo you might be wondering why the fuck you've never heard of this company if their vaccine's so great? The truth is that Pfizer has done everything that they can to keep NVAX out of the media - similar to getting shadowbanned on social media. He who controls the media controls the narrative and right now Pfizer is pushing their shitty vaccine and more boosters that are now 'safe' for kids. I don't believe any of that bullshit. Personally my wife took the Johnson &amp; Johnson (not mRNA) vaccine and then caught covid a few weeks later. She still experienced all the symptoms - fatigue, fever, chills, loss of taste/smell, etc. I had not been vaccinated and she spread it to me and I experienced the same shit. My sister took the Pfizer vaccine and caught the rona a week later and was extremely sick for about a week. Lastly, a colleague of mine who took the Moderna vaccine experienced extreme reactions to both shots, still got covid, and has now been diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis. What the fuck, these shitty mRNA vaccines aren't working and Pfizer won't admit to it. Instead they come out with a new pill to help you recover once you have covid. That makes zero sense because IF their vaccine was effective there would be no need for a covid pill which comes with severe side effects. This is the equivalent of going into the condom manufacturing business and then your customers are complaining because they're getting everyone pregnant because your condoms don't work and so the solution is to provide plan-b? Personally I'd prefer to risk it and just raw dog it, but that's me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoving on to how Pfizer is fucking with Novavax. For those of you not aware Pfizer worked closely with BioNTech developing the vaccine. On October 19th an article was released by Politico ([https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/19/novavax-vaccine-rush-process-global-campaign-516298](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/19/novavax-vaccine-rush-process-global-campaign-516298)) simply bashing the company and their manufacturing failures, which Novavax positively responded to the very next day ([https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Reconfirms-Confidence-in-Regulatory-Filing-Timelines-and-Manufacturing-Quality](https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Reconfirms-Confidence-in-Regulatory-Filing-Timelines-and-Manufacturing-Quality)). Coincidentally this article road on the coat tails of the purchase of Politico by Axel Springer ([https://www.axelspringer.com/en/ax-press-release/axel-springer-completes-acquisition-of-politico](https://www.axelspringer.com/en/ax-press-release/axel-springer-completes-acquisition-of-politico)) which just so happened to be finalized that exact same day. Politico is purchased by Axel Springer and then a couple hours later the article is released shitting on Novavax. And since then, they have released additional slander that has negatively impacted the stock price of Novavax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you connect the dots you will see that the CEO of Axel Springer (German company) has had strong ties to BioNTech (German biotech) since the very beginning of their vaccine development. The red flag is that the article released on Oct 19 in addition to others dating to present day are being published as Novavax begins submitting for approval to the World Health Organization (WHO), European Union (EU), UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, India for the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Oddly enough, the articles all have 'anonymous' sources without a single credible source being named. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$1 billion is a drop in the bucket to bash a company when you have a market cap of $306 billion and endless control over the media and governments around the world. Every single time Novavax releases positive news, within a few days an article is released bashing them OR Pfizer happens to release some positive news about their covid related products. What they don't want you to know is that they put in a request to not release any of their covid related data to the public for the next 55 years. What they don't want you to know is that some of their data was skewed in their trials to receive an expedited approval. What they don't want you to know is that Scott Gottlieb is a former FDA commissioner in charge of regulating Pfizer is also on the board of directors of Pfizer, Stephen Hahn is a former FDA commissioner in charge of regulating Moderna is the current Chief Medical Officer of Flagship Pioneering (the venture capital firm behind Moderna), and James C. Smith who is the CEO of Reuters and is on the Board of Directors for Pfizer. This is a major red flag to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd where the fuck do all these 'Main Stream' media outlets like CNN, CBS, CNBC, Reuters, USA Today, The New York Times, Business Week, etc. receive their advertising money from? Fucking Pfizer. Just check out this short clip...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC1h6l-eXJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC1h6l-eXJw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Summary**\n\nAfter endless slander in the news and repeated short attacks (more than likely by hedgies with money provided by Pfizer) the Novavax share price has taken a serious hit and is very undervalued. Novavax has a solution that will actually work, has no severe side effects, and soon the world will know about it. As of writing this Australia expects to have a final decision on NVAX ([https://twitter.com/TillaInvest/status/1466575400591507456?s=20](https://twitter.com/TillaInvest/status/1466575400591507456?s=20)) in the coming days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy position is a total of 1396 shares that cost me $220,318.10. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for some serious movement to the upside over the next 88 days. Do your DD and make the right choice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: If you find any holes in any of this, fill them in like my wife's BF does to her.",

Background**\n\nFor  those of you that are not aware of this company, simply put they are a  small biotech based out of Maryland. Prior to March of 2020 they  developed experimental vaccines for Ebola, influenza, respiratory  syncytial virus, and other emerging infectious diseases. Please note  'influenza' is where they had been working heavily prior to the covid-19  outbreak. In fact they had been working on Nanoflu (in a nut shell is a  more effective flu shot) which has shown to provide very effective  immune responses. When the world shut down and we got hit with the rona  they were in a good position to pivot and begin working on a vaccine to  save the world. You might wonder what is taking them so long? Simply  put, being a very small company with limited capital and resources they  couldn't compete with Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, or Moderna who just  so happen to be dominating the current market. However, the snails pace  development allowed them create a safer and more effective vaccine  versus the mRNA competition.\n\n**How does the Novavax vaccine work?**\n\nThe  Novavax COVID-19 vaccine contains a protein (made using moth cells)  plus an adjuvant (made from tree bark). An adjuvant is an ingredient  added to boost a person's immune response, creating higher levels of  antibodies.\n\nThe  Novavax vaccine uses a telltale piece of the coronavirus: the notorious  spike protein. All alone, the spike protein is harmless and can't cause  COVID-19. When your immune system encounters the lonely spike protein,  it produces antibodies against it. This gives you protection against  future COVID-19 infection.\n\n\"Unlike  mRNA vaccines, the spike protein is already premade in the Novavax  vaccine. It's a shortcut,\" explains Dr. Florescu. \n\nLike  other COVID-19 vaccines, Novavax does not cause COVID-19 infection. It  can't get you sick. This vaccine doesn't contain either live or  inactivated virus.\n\nHow did they get the spike protein?\n\nThe Novavax method uses moth cells to make spike proteins:\n\nResearchers select the desired genes that create certain SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein).\n\nResearchers put the genes into a baculovirus, an insect virus.\n\nThe baculovirus infects moth cells and replicates inside them.\n\nThese moth cells create lots of spike proteins.\n\nResearchers extract and purify the spike proteins.\n\n\"The  Novavax vaccine has no genetic material, only proteins,\" says Dr.  Florescu. \"The vaccine technology is more traditional, and it's very  similar to a protein-based influenza vaccine.\"\n\nInfluenza vaccines have also used this moth cell factory method.\n\nWhat does the adjuvant (soapbark tree extract) do?\n\nAdjuvants  increase the immune response to a vaccine. In this vaccine, soapbark  tree extract adjuvant makes achieving immunity possible with a smaller  dose of the spike protein.\n\nMatrix-M  is the adjuvant used by Novavax. It is based on a saponin extracted  from the soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria). The soapbark extract  encourages immune cells to activate, generating a more potent immune  response.\n\nSaponins  are found naturally in various plant species like beans and green peas.  They're used in agriculture, animal feeds, veterinary vaccines and  human food. Saponins can boost immune responses to proteins. Using the  Matrix-M adjuvant, a smaller dose of spike protein achieves the desired  immune response.\n\nsource: [https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/moths-and-tree-bark-how-the-novavax-vaccine-works](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/moths-and-tree-bark-how-the-novavax-vaccine-works)\n\n**So just how effective was their vaccine in trials?**\n\nNovavax  is another highly effective COVID-19 vaccine.

These typically lasted less than three days.\n\nWho was in the clinical trial?\n\nOver  29,000 people participated in the trial. UNMC was one of 113 sites in  the United States. \"We're grateful to all participants for their help,\"  says Dr. Florescu. \"Major medical breakthroughs could not happen without  the generosity of the trial participants.\"\n\n\"People  were so enthusiastic to participate,\" says Dr. Florescu. \"One family  included every family member in the trial. Grandparents, parents and  children \u2013 all three generations \u2013 took part in it.\" Thirteen percent  were older than 65, a high-risk age group for severe COVID-19.\n\nThe trial also included people from multiple backgrounds:\n\n20% Latino/Latina\n\n12% African American\n\n7% Native American\n\n5% Asian American\n\nsource: [https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/novavax-vaccine-results-how-effective-is-it-against-variants](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/novavax-vaccine-results-how-effective-is-it-against-variants)\n\n**2.

        "selftext": "Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I\u00b4ll try to do that and post it here. That\u00b4s my first analysis for V. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I\u00b4ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Visa\u00b4s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for V\u00b4s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in V. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\n\nFirst let\u00b4s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **39%** of their sales comes from **Data Processing Revenues**. Another **35%** comes from **Service** **Revenues**. **International Transaction Revenues** makes up for **20%** and the remaining **5%** are **Other Revenues.**\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 6,9%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for V\u00b4s stock of **$222 per share**. But because we have to account for **V\u00b4s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$220 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith V\u00b4s price being at **$193** **per share** right now, it\u00b4s kind of undervalued. That\u00b4s why I think buying *heavily* might be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see V\u00b4s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$498 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. \n\n**What I\u00b4ll do.** I believe V is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That\u00b4s why I will start buying heavily every chance I get.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.",

        "selftext": "***Due Dilligence post on  what i  believe to  be an  amazing 'once in a lifetime' opportunity***\n\nLast untested large frontier rift basins in onshore Africa $IVZ $IVCTF Invictus Energy Ltd (ASX: IVZ) (OTC: IVCTF)\n\nLatest 3rd December 2021 Mini Documentary on the company: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZsX0EzLH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZsX0EzLH0)\n\nSimilar to the popular 88E Energy, and nearby ReconAfrica.\n\nThe extensive exploration undertaken by Mobil in the 90's made evident the significant size and technical merits of the Cabora Bassa project. (***9.25 TCF + 294 million barrels of conventional gas / condensate)***\n\n**Company Directors:**\n\nIVZ Country Manager (Brent Barber) done the Seismic on this land back in the day for Exxxon Mobil and kept his eyes on it until now.\n\nDr Stuart Lake (IVZ Non-Executive Chairman) has a stirling reputation in the industry and has made over 300 oil and gas discoveries in 11 countries with a track record of 90% success rate.\n\nAll directors are heavily invested: [https://www.invictusenergy.com/corporate/board-management/](https://www.invictusenergy.com/corporate/board-management/)  \n\n\n**IVZ already released a prospective resource report in 2019.** [The report can be seen](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02119028-6A935205?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4) [here](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02119028-6A935205?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)\n\nThere is also a research report by Envoi UK available here: [http://envoi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/P255Invictus(Zimbabwe-SG4571)EnvoIProjectIntroduction.pdf](http://envoi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/P255Invictus(Zimbabwe-SG4571)EnvoIProjectIntroduction.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Total prospective resource of 9.25 TCF + 294 million barrels of conventional gas / condensate***\n\n*(1) Mzarabani Prospect estimated to contain 8.2 TCF + 250 Million barrels of gas*\n\n*(2) Msasa Prospect estimated to contain 1.05 TCF + 44 million barrels of gas*\n\nSo there is more than 1 play here with potential at both. This study was determined by Getech Group, over a 12 month study of Cabora Bassa Project. (if even a fraction is found at either its a big success).\n\nPage 5 also states: The Best estimates reported represent that ***there is a 50% probability that the actual resource volume will be in excess of the amounts reported.***\n\nPage 5 also states: There is greater than 50% chance that if a discovery is made, it will be commercialised. The company has already signed Gas sale MOUs.\n\n**If successful, IVZ will potentially be a multi billion dollar company (a bare minimum of 10 bags+ OVERNIGHT).**\n\n**Currently the company only has a market cap of AU$80M , so its still early days.**\n\n**The drilling campaign is scheduled for \\~April 2022**\n\n**The company has just completed a new 2D Seismic with Polaris** (the same company ReconAfrica used, whom found success)\n\nI wouldn't want to miss out on the opportunity IVZ presents.\n\nHow many elephant sized resources are left that have yet to be drilled? I think the vast majority of major discoveries have already been made.\n\nWe are in a very unique position with this play, and an amazing balance of risk vs reward. To top it off, millions of dollars have been spent here to obtain and certify the data on the prospective resources. (nothing is guaranteed, ofcourse - but i definitely want to stick around and be apart of it). You've got to risk it for the biscuit. \n\n *\"Invictus prospective resource has been independently certified by both Getech and NSAI - its not just large, its elephant scale. So for those not familiar with the terminology elephant scale is resources of 1 billion barrells of oil equivalent or more. So 9TCF is about double the size of the Pluto Gas Fields in WA (Western  Australia) - and (to put this in perspective) Waitsia in WA which has been the largest onshore gas discovery in Austraila for 40 years is just under 1TCF. Not only is there a lot of gas but potentially a lot of liquid associated with it aswell - so condensate which is a form of oil.\"*  \n \n\n# Preliminary Seismic Results  (NOV 2021)\n\n[https://hotcopper.com.au/documentembed?id=uOMxKKzFkiWRTLKhOROKAxjvTDYL4wi%2ByhP%2Fv%2F5v5bFiGug%3D](https://hotcopper.com.au/documentembed?id=uOMxKKzFkiWRTLKhOROKAxjvTDYL4wi%2ByhP%2Fv%2F5v5bFiGug%3D)\n\nThere are quite a few youtube interviews / videos / podcasts with the company if you would like to get a better understanding. Even a small segment on AlJazeera in 2020.\n\nLatest 3rd December 2021 Mini Documentary on the company: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZsX0EzLH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZsX0EzLH0)\n\n**Disclosure:** I am balls deep invested, and i truly believe there will be a rally pre-drill with the opportunity to freecarry into the drilling campaign with the potential to 10-20x",
