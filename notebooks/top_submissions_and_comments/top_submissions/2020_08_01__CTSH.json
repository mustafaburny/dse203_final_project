        "selftext": "Listen up fellas. \n\nTelehealth has tremendous potential moving forwards, we all know that. Additionally, the world is becoming increasingly cognizant of mental health and the importance of maintaining it. \n\nOTRK combines telehealth with mental health. I would describe what they do but the Motley Fool probably does it better than me:\n\n \"The artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform targets and engages with those coping with chronic conditions whose lives can improve with behavioral change. The company then delivers its insights to patients either in-person or via telehealth connection with a healthcare professional.\n\nLike Livongo, Ontrak partners with employers and healthcare plans to find, treat, and support those with behavioral health conditions, eventually delivering medical expense savings upwards of 50%.\"\n\nA lot of people have been comparing OTRK to LVGO over the last few weeks. For those who don't know, LVGO is a &gt;12B market cap stock who deals with telehealth for diabetes. They grew heavily in 2019 and 2020, with revenue going from $40M to $91 M in Q2 2020. They are now positive cash flow, whereas they were bigly in the red a year ago. From this growth their stock has seen over a 400% increase in value.  \n\nGuess which company has similar financial to the old LVGO. OTRK made 17 M in revenue (+124% YoY) in Q2 2020, but is debt ridden and has negative cash flow. They shot up almost 100% on the earnings beat to $60 and now have a market cap of $1B. This seems like a fair valuation, as they're following the footsteps of LVGO but still need a few more years to get there, right? WRONG\n\nIn the OTRK earnings call, their CEO Terren Peizer gave guidance for 90 MILLION total revenue in 2020. They're at less 30 Million after two quarters. That's some rapid fucking growth. The CEO seems a little sketchy. He did some work in 1983 as a highly yield bond salesman and he ratted on one of his buddies to the SEC in exchange for immunity. I don't trust the guy and you shouldn't either. \n\nBut, their CEO is pumping the shit out of this company, and who the hell is going to tell him he's wrong until their next earnings report when we actually get to see what they've been up to. Their $1B market cap should probably be $3B by the next earnings call if people buy into his projections. That's a stock price of $60-$180.\n\nThis company is possibly a scam, so be wary, but this shit could pump to the moon. \n\nDISCLAIMER: These options have relatively low volume and large bid/asks. Don't try and make hella trades with this shit. Get into a position you like and hold it for a few weeks. \n\nTLDR: Buy OTM options on OTRK dated no later than November.",

        "selftext": "**Overview**\n\nIn order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, governments in [188 different countries](https://www.brookings.edu/research/school-closures-government-responses-and-learning-inequality-around-the-world-during-covid-19/) have implemented school closures. For the United States specifically, every state and territory ordered or recommended school closures\u2014affecting upwards of 55 million students across the country. Wary of the achievement gap that could spur from prolonged closures, the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) has recently released [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools-faq.html) for reopening schools. Moreover, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York [recently announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/nyregion/cuomo-schools-reopening.html) that schools can decide to open so long as they are in a region where the average rate of positive coronavirus tests is below 5 percent over a two-week period.\u00a0\n\n**Efficacy of School Reopening: Lessons from Other Nations**\n\nExtended school closures impact students in a variety of ways: it fosters learning loss, weakens social and emotional skills, entrenches abuse in unstable homes, and can lead to a decline in nutritional health. Cognizant of the importance of in-person instruction, multiple countries have already set guidelines to reopen their schools:\n\n*Denmark*\n\n* In Denmark, students were to stay 2 meters apart wherever possible, were grouped into \u201cbubbles\u201d of 12, and were required to wash their hands every two hours but not to wear masks.\u00a0\n\n*Germany*\n\n* In Germany, their government cut class sizes in half, had one-way hallways, staggered breaks, masks for teachers and free twice-weekly Covid-19 tests for students and teachers.\n\n*Taiwan*\n\n* In Taiwan, students returned to school and were required to go through temperature checks at school entries and to wear face masks. Additionally, Taiwan left school reopening to a more localized decision to account for differing infection rates in the country.\n\nIn each of these nations, case and mortality counts continued to decline after reopening schools\u2014a positive indication that school reopenings have been effectively implemented with a variety of guidelines.\n\n**Concerns With School Reopening**\n\nAlthough some governments were able to successfully reopen schools, other governments were not as successful. In Jerusalem, over 100 students and 15 staff members were infected after an outbreak occurred at a high school. To alleviate the spread of COVID-19 in schools, the CDC recommends more research on mitigation strategies (i.e. face masks, the use of cohorting, social distancing).\n\nThe Council of Chief State School Officers estimated that schools would need between $158.1 billion and $244.6 billion in additional funding to open safely.\u00a0\n\nOn top of the estimated [158.1 billion to 244.6 billion dollars](https://ccsso.org/blog/ccsso-submits-cost-estimate-safely-reopening-public-schools-after-covid) school are estimated to need to open safely, considering that the United States has recently surpassed five million virus cases, school reopenings could pose a harm to children\u2014especially considering that the response to COVID-19 has not been as effective as other nations that have reopened schools.\n\n**Financial Impacts**\n\n*Stocks*\n\nOnline educational institutions and virtual schools have seen increases in enrollment as a result of extended school closures. Publicly traded company K12\u2014which currently owns 40% of the market\u2014saw [stocks rise 21%.](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-03-05-public-markets-watch-for-coronavirus-impact-on-edtech-stocks) Chegg, a popular service for study materials and tutors, has seen stocks rise [87% in the last year.](https://investorplace.com/2020/07/5-online-education-stocks-that-can-expand-your-horizons/)\n\n*Costs to School Districts*\n\nThe pandemic will cost states [$555 billion over fiscal years 2020 to 2022.](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/states-continue-to-face-large-shortfalls-due-to-covid-19-effects) Seeing as school districts rely on state funding and local tax revenue that is likely to be cut because of rampant unemployment, it is likely that districts will have to resort to laying off employees or lessening the quality of education. This occurred during the Great Recession when the Clark County School District in Nevada [laid off upwards of 500 employees in a single year.](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2011/01/13/16landscape.h30.html)\n\nLet us know what you think!",

        "selftext": " \n\n **Tinley Beverage Company ($TNYBF $TNY)** makes award winning cannabis beverages in California. The flavors are designed to replicate alcoholic drinks like Fireball, Margarita, Moscow Mule, Malibu Coconut Rum, Amaretto, Kahlua. They also offer non-alcoholic ready to drink cocktails under the Beckett's brand names, available at Bevmo, and soon to begin trials at warehouse stores like Sam's or Costco.\n\nThey built a new plant with a high-tech bottling line, which recently received its license, and will soon be commissioned into use. In addition to making their own drinks, they are expected to announce copacking deals to make cannabis drinks for their clients. Former NBA player Baron Davis is on board as an advisor, he helped grow and sell Vitaminwater. Here are some of their key upcoming events anticipated by long-term shareholders. Particularly of interest are the copacking deals to manufacture beverages for other cannabis companies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q2 Financials (Ending June 30th) will be out in just a few short weeks.** To give you an idea what this might look like: As of June 24th, \"the Company has fully exhausted its inventory of Tinley\u2122 \u201927 multi-serve products, which were produced at the Company\u2019s recently-decommissioned Phase 2 facility. The Company\u2019s inventory of carbonated, ready-to-drink products is nearly depleted\". \"The Company expects to generate initial co-packing revenue in Q2 from pre-production packaging services\". These numbers will be interesting nonetheless. As a comparison, at March 31st, the Company had $174,000 in revenues for the first 3 months of the year, and $277,807 in finished goods. The releases subsequent have laid it out black and white, this product has been SOLD. When it hits the financials is another question, but it is coming. There will obviously be a period of time throughout Q3 that some product would not be widely available until the most recent production at Long Beach.\n\n**The Company's Long Beach Facility is fully licensed (and producing)!** As of July 2, \"the initial run of Tinley\u2019s\u2122 \u201927 products will include the Company\u2019s new Tinley\u2019s\u2122 \u201927 Arabica Cask.\" There had been some speculation as to whether this would happen \"mid-July\". As stated, \"the Company expects the first bottling run to take place in the facility by mid-July.\" Since this time, pictures with multi-serve beverages, mainly the Cinnamon Cask, have come to light. Remember that the Coconut Cask is the Company's number 1 seller. Reading between the lines, one can infer that even though the Cinnamon pictures came out a few days ago, the Coconut Cask was most surely produced before then. Production would have been occurring over the past few weeks as a result. As of July 29 interview with Jeff Maser and Money Works Magazine, production was in the works at that very moment in time, and had been for some time already.  Single serves will be completed after the multi. The team is working to get California stocked.\n\n**A massive consumer trend in non-alcoholic beverages has emerged while many of us have been shareholders, right under our noses.** Further to the Money Works Magazine interview, one development that has taken hold over the last year or two is that a massive, massive, consumer trend has emerged in non-alcoholic beverages. This has occurred during the time many of you have been shareholders. The massive demand for this emerging trend is prudent to capture; it had an estimated market share of $18 Billion last year alone, growing in the triple digits in certain markets around the world. The company has diversified its risk by focusing attention to it, and used their know-how and resources to capitalize on this astronomical growth. Remember, the Company's principals are the best of the best in the beverage space (their bio's are at the bottom of this post). They're making strategic decisions on behalf of shareholders, allocating time and efforts where money is to be made. Bear in mind that although infused beverages are the Company's bread and butter (Tinley's), regulations have made its rollout much slower than that of Beckett's (non-infused line). Beckett's can be rolled out very easily (using the same great taste and formulations already developed), while regulators take their time to make many facets of the business easier (or more difficult?). Revenue recognition is also much, much faster with Beckett's. Banking regulations unfortunately make revenue recognition much slower with Tinley's. Some have pointed out that Jeff has only mentioned Beckett's lately. In Canada, there is an extremely fine line when talking about the two business lines. The regulations do not allow for a cross marketing of the two. You either talk about Tinley's, or you talk about Beckett's, not both. Be cognizant of this.\n\n**The Company has at least 4 commitments from supermarkets/chains for Beckett's.** The June monthly CSE report (form 7) stated, the company is \"working to obtain additional grocery, liquor store and other retail placements for its beverages\". The July report had a slight change of wording: the Company is \"working to begin trials at the previously-disclosed grocery and warehouse chains, as well as obtain additional grocery, liquor store ecommerce and other retail placements for its non-infused beverages\". This indicates they are one step closer to a rollout. Jeff indicated in the most recent interview with Money Works Magazine that they \"ramped up production;\" producing more Beckett's last week for these demos.\n\n**Closing of the current Private Placement will happen today.** Since its announcement several weeks ago, the share price has held steady, but the most important development here - nearly 5 million shares have been purchased, in the open market, over this time. (Most likely bought off of those selling to buy in on the private placement). That is one incredibly large position that was taken over the past month. The placement took a bit of time due to some last minute due diligence by one of the houses taking interest, which is not unusual in the industry.\n\n**Celebrity endorsements are coming.** There have been some questions coming up as to why this has not happened yet. It has always been important to ensure the Company had ample inventory, and distribution in place prior to announcing these. It is **absolutely imperative** to have this in place before letting celebrities endorse and tell their followers. There have been many examples of celebrities doing such with other products, only to have inventory and website issues unable to handle the newfound demand. With beverages, you only get 1 shot to win over the consumer. Get it right, the first time. With Long Beach up and running, it is safe to say the Company is one step closer to releasing this news. The Company is \"working to finalize initiatives with prominent figures **(with an S)** in sports and entertainment for marketing of Tinley products and co-packing clients\u2019 products.\"\n\n**Copacking. There has been \"a ton of interest\".** The May 27th release is most important here: Mr. \\[Baron\\] Davis is currently working on marketing initiatives and development of new products for the Company\u2019s own products and its expected co-packing clients\u2019 products. We also know that the copackers are \"well known\". There is some major money to be had here...\"Well Known\" being the key words \ud83d\udcf7;) With the July 2nd licensing news, \"the Company is now in a position to consummate agreements in its pipeline of prospective co-packing clients, and it will update the market as such agreements come to fruition.\"\n\n**Canada will be announced \"shortly\"** regarding Beckett's, and Tinley's. When this happens, remember that Canada is a very, very large piece of real estate. The product will hit, but it's rollout and availability won't happen in a single day. It will take some time. You may see it in Toronto right away for example, but may take some time to reach its way to Vancouver. The logistics are quite immense.\n\nAs shareholders, to truly be a part of the company's success, it is absolutely imperative to share the story with friends, family, business owners, neighbours. Let's hit the ground running.\n\nTo summarize, In no particular order, be sure to watch out for the following:\n\n\\- Q2 financials\n\n\\- fully commissioned production facility announcement\n\n\\- copacking arrangements\n\n\\- Beckett's chains announcements\n\n\\- territorial expansion (Canada etc)\n\n\\- marketing and celebrity endorsements\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Company and its main principals, feel free to read below (I absolutely encourage those who do know to have a re-read),  it will give you an idea of just how connected the Company is in the beverage space, or if you have any doubt. I hope this has been a great help for those who may have been in the dark on a few of the Company's developments.\n\nCheers!\n\n**Richard Gillis, President, Western USA**\n\n\u2022 Previously President, Youngs Market Company \u2013 US$3 billion in annual sales; 2nd largest beverage alcohol distributor in Western USA\n\n\u2022 EVP/General Manager of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Southwest USA\n\n\u2022 30 years in various senior positions in the beverage and CPG industries\n\n**Jeffrey Maser, Founder, CEO of Becketts (non-infused) Canada**\n\n\u2022 Previously in beverage branding and product strategy at the Watt Design Group, a subsidiary of Cott Corporation during period when Cott was the largest beverage company in the world after Coca Cola and Pepsi\n\n\u2022 10 years in venture capital, merchant and investment banking with a focus on emerging industries\n\n**Ted Zittell, Director &amp; Brand Manager**\n\n\u2022 Previously President of Cott\u2019s Retail Brands International, where he led the creation and launch of premium retailer brand and marketing programs worldwide\n\n\u2022 Senior partner at The Watt Design Group for 17 years (including during period of ownership by Cott Corp.)\n\n\u2022 Senior consultant for McMillan Doolittle LLP, a leading Chicago-based retail and consumer experience agency\n\n\u2022 Advisor for US private equity and investment funds in the food and beverage sectors\n\n\u2022 Recent executive-level engagements include work for Walmart, Kroger, CVS Pharmacy, P&amp;G, Nestl\u00e9, Loblaws, Sainsbury's and Tesco\n\n**Mark Benadiba, Advisory Board**\n\n\u2022 Previously CEO, Cott Canada and EVP Operations, USA\n\n\u2022 Board of Directors, Cott Corporation (2008-2017)\n\n**Andrew Stodart, Advisory Board &amp; Tinley Canada Lead**\n\n\u2022 Launched Crystal Head Vodka and brought from concept to nationwide North American distribution in 18 months\n\n\u2022 Oversaw the launch of Dan Aykroyd Wines at Diamond Estates Wines and Spirits\n\n\u2022 International brand manager for Black Velvet Whisky (Constellation Brands); built from a declining brand into the 3rd-largest selling brand in its category\n\n\u2022 Various roles at Patron Tequila and Everfresh Juice\n\n**Baron Davis, Advisory Board**\n\n\u2022 Two-time NBA All Star; played for the Charlotte Hornets, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks\n\n\u2022 Early Vitaminwater\u00ae investor\n\n\u2022 Entrepreneur and Investor in Film and Music Production, Publications, Merchandise and Retail, Beverage, Finance, Real Estate, and Technology\n\n**Curt Marvis, Director**\n\n\u2022 MTV Lifetime Achievement Award recipient\n\n\u2022 Previously President, Digital Media, Lionsgate Entertainment (NYSE:LGF.A)\n\n\u2022 Founder and CEO, QYOU Television (TSXV:QYOU), an LA &amp; Toronto based, millennial-focused television &amp; media company distributed in 35 countries\n\n**Douglas Fulton, Director**\n\n\u2022 LA-Based, European Emmy Award-winning television executive\n\n\u2022 Co-Founder of LA Christine, a line of premium skincare products\n\n**Ben Knight, Advisory Board**\n\n\u2022 Founder of CMX Distribution and 420 Central Brand Stores in California\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Corporate Presentation:** [https://drinktinley.com/wp-content/uploads/Tinley-Corporate-Presentation-Q2-2020-1.pdf](https://drinktinley.com/wp-content/uploads/Tinley-Corporate-Presentation-Q2-2020-1.pdf)",

        "selftext": "I am seeing a shit load of new treads discussing the following-\n\n1. Fastly vs NET\n2. Hold Fastly or let go?\n3. What does Fastly do? \n\nSo I will clear up a few myths just in case. \n\nFastly is a CDN provider, which allows their clients to host their website on Fastly's servers. Fastly's business model is catered towards large enterprises that are looking at fastest (thus the name!) cold start time, i.e. time it takes to load a webpage on mobile/PC. Here are a few of their clients-\n\n1. **Clients doing very well during Covid**\n\n* Reddit\n* Shopify\n* Wayfair\n* Pinterest\n* Twitter\n* Stripe\n* Overstock\n* Shazam\n* Wealthfront\n* Etsy\n* Tiktok\n\n2. **Clients doing not so well during Covid**\n\n* Airbnb\n* Jetblue\n* Trip Advisor\n* Alaska Air\n* Kayak\n* Yelp\n* Kayak,\n* and many more....\n\nNotice first that their clients that are booming right now are very likely to continue booming for the next year or so. Once we are done with Covid (that is if), revenues will switch to clients in hospitality business, which typically have a strong business during normal times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFastly's USP is fastest cold start time, i.e., it is the best CDN in the market which allows the visitors on their client's website to load the webpage/apps faster than anyone else in the market right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is this USP so important**\\--well there are a few reasons why Fastly will continue to have higher growth rate.  I have noted a few down below-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Apple rolls out 5g iPhone later this year. They will require webpages to load faster. Fastly is the best CDN there is to handle that request. This does not mean that Akamai or NET are sitting out catching honeybee, but really means that Fastly is positioned to serve that switch to 5g better than NET or Akamai IMO.\n2. Fastly's business model is unique. It charges their customers based on the bytes loaded, which translates to the amount of time people spend on their customers' website. Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). Notice that this is a different business model than NET. NET offers a free subscription to begin with and has lower CDN hosting rate for those willing to host on their servers. Therefore, organizations which do not feel that speed is of concern to them as much, prefer to use NET. On the flip side, Fastly has a niche set of customers who value speed, because user experience on their website is of utmost importance to them. Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.\n3. YoY growth based on investor's copy was 62%, which is great if you ask me. As long as it is staying above 50, my money is parked there.\n4. Bergman and Josh raised guidance for this year, during a time when a lot of CFOs are holing on giving guidance. Also of importance is that these folks in the C suite like to give a conservative guidance and beat it. In other words, promise less and deliver more. This leaves no question that next earnings should be a beat but do not take my word on it because who knows what happens tomorrow.\n\n**Influence of Tiktok on Fastly's revenue**\n\nCertainly one of the most important question that needs to be addressed because Tiktok constitutes 12% of the revenues. With the stock dropping like a rock after ER and then earnier today after Donny decided to ban it after 45 days, looks like a lot of the uncertainty is already baked into the price at this moment. Those who were uncertain unboarded the train today. That point is the exhaustion point where bulls come in and drive the stock higher (e.g., Chegg today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally feel that Tiktok MSFT should be a done deal and they are waiting to announce this sometime this month. I am neither an insider nor do I happen to know the actually outcome. However, I do follow hedge fund option sentiment and I have noticed bullish calls inflow for MSFT this past couple days. While I am a peasant who is not connected to anyone involved with the deal, I am sure some of these whales are aware of the decision, which is part of the reason for that bullish call inflow for MSFT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Should you dump FSLY or not?**\n\nEntirely up to you but I see a lot of growth in this company. Fundamentally, nothing has changed in how they operate. The company gave an upward guidance and that drives the stock in forward direction. Some sellers left the ship because a lot of RH investors have not seen losses in their life or some are not even aware of the potential of this company, except it became a meme stock lately and FOMO drove a lot of noobs in FSLY train.\n\nIt is always better to curtail losses. If you trust that they will continue to bring in revenues, I would dollar cost average on every dip. This ensures your average cost of the share is reduced significantly with any dip. Most fund managers actually add stocks to their funds when the stock is sitting at 30 day MA. Fastly had such a quick run up that the 30 day MA kept moving. All of that being said, I think it may rest for some time before beginning the next leg up. That could be a week, 2 weeks, or a month but you will have to be patient if you do not want to loose money. However, never panik sell on a red day because that is literally the day people like me buy from people who are selling. \n\nWould Monday bring a ray of light and we open green-\n\nNo one knows what happens but I would continue to DCA on every 5% drop. I remember when Square dropped a couple years ago, I kept DCAing and here I am sitting on gains. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped convince some of you.",

Do chip in your thoughts about it!\n\nAAPL - 5.57%\nMSFT - 10.44%\nAMZN - 9.52%\nFB - 9.17%\nGOOG - 6.91%\nNVDA - 10.3%\nADBE - 13.54%\nASML - 9.07%\nTSM - 7.48%\nV - 9.35%\nMA - 8.64%\n\nI think majority of the stock selections are pretty mainstream, picked to mimic QQQ. I personally added TSM and ASML as I\u2019m a strong believer in semiconductors going forward.\n\nWhat differentiates the portfolio above and QQQ is the weights itself. Instead of adjusting it based on market cap, I\u2019ve decided to optimise the weights above with a sole focus - to maximise Sortino Ratio.\n\nBacktested portfolio since Sept 2012 vs QQQ:\nCAGR - 36.71% vs 20.06%\nStDev - 16.97% vs 14.97%\nBest Year - 57.78% vs 38.96%\nWorst Year - 5.52% vs -3.63%\nSortino Ratio - 4.17 vs 2.28\n\nBy analysing the numbers above, it\u2019s basically a less diverse portfolio with 11 holdings, higher StdDev but significantly higher returns, and a much more efficient fund. Even the worst year for it is still a positive return. \n\nYes I\u2019m aware that my findings are based on historical prices and it doesn\u2019t guarantee future returns",

        "selftext": "Since everyone has been talking about investing in SQ, I thought maybe we could start an open discussion about the risks of Square the business, whether or not we can continue to expect a skyrocketing share price in the years to come.\n\nI'll point out some things I'm iffy about, would like to get feedback on what you all think. Maybe there's things I'm not aware of.\n\n* Competitors. Square has a good product in an explosive growth industry, but I see their products easily replicable by Apple, Google, and PayPal. Should their business prove to have high demand and margins, there's no doubt FAANG giants will follow. Square has a head start, but do they have a competitive advantage? They have lots of commercial business data atm, but I'm doubtful of the value of that in today's market (more on that in my next point). They're beginning to collect consumer data, but imagine how much more data Visa and Mastercard has over them on that. Their technology is easily replicable by other big companies with enough resources to execute.\n* The limitations of the loan business. One of Square's most promising competitive advantages is that they provide loans to small businesses that show promising growth and room for expansion based on their revenue and profit which is logged into the Square system. There is an undeniable market of unserved small business owners that greatly benefit from this feature, but it's doubtful that this would unleash profits that wouldn't hit a low ceiling most of the time. For example, a hair salon can only purchase so many new salon chairs before they run out of customers to serve within that vicinity. Square could strike gold with a really profitable revolutionary small business, but I don't see why those businesses wouldn't be funded by VC's first before coming to Square. Even if they came to Square first, those businesses are one in a million. I do see Square making profits here, but not profits that would take them out of a niche player role.\n* The limitations of commercial business data. With current data limitations, it's impossible for Square's current technology to be an efficient evaluator of which businesses can achieve explosive growth and which ones will never escape low margins. There are too many non-numerical variables in determining a profitable business. Data technology and AI is not there yet.\n* Personal finance inertia. For Square to disrupt the banking industry, they need some clear advantage over banks. Why should we do the extra work of switching over if we are at an established bank? I'm not saying Square wouldn't be a better option than a traditional bank, but it takes a lot to turn the tide in an industry as conservative as the banking industry.\n\nFeel free to refute any of these concerns, maybe there's something really compelling to Square that I'm not seeing. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know.",

        "selftext": "So we've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$AAPL, $MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.\n\nThe tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.\n\nBullish    means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current     close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$ILMN** \\- Bullish probability of 88.43%. I know this dropped hard today but the tool is bullish on it. If it starts to go back, it will be a good setup. If it continue going down, don't get in. **Risky setup, careful!**\n\n**$NVAX** \\- Bullish probability of 77.14%. I like that it dropped today. Either get in if it touches the support at $160 and bounces back or get in on a pull back at the moving averages ([https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png](https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png))\n\n**$LULU** \\- Bullish probability of 74.80%. Seems like a good setup, especially with a small pullback ([https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png](https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png))\n\n**$FSLY** \\- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This dropped right at its 50 MA. A good setup as long as the price stays above 50MA ([https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png](https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png)). Exit otherwise.\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$BAC** \\-  Bearish probability of 86.76%. I like it for a bearish setup if it can below the support of $25.2 ([https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png)).\n\n**$ZNGA** \\-  Bearish probability of 83.96%. This is at a very strong support level at $9.9. **Do not get in unless it breaks the support** ([https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png)).\n\n**$GILD** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.68%. Might go up a bit before going down further. Healthcare stocks are risky though so be careful.\n\n**$WDC** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.66%. Only a good setup if price stays below the support level of $37.8 ([https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png](https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png))\n\n \n\n**Note:**  A lot of time has gone into these tools and it takes time to write  these alerts, look at    charts, and post them here. Would love for you  guys to **try out our** [discord](https://discord.gg/X2hHeJ) **channel** where I post alerts from various tools, not just the options one. Please hit me up if you want to link, it's free to join.\n\n**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.**",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, here's a trade I made on NFLX that I wanted to share with you guys. I wasn't able to post it then because I was banned: \n\nI sold a 1x3 ratio put spread 510/485p for a 4.80 credit (7/16 12 PM PST) and exited for a 16.80 net credit. Collateral: \\~17k.\n\n# Strategy:\n\nThe idea behind my strategy was that since NFLX ran pretty hard into earnings and had an impulsive selloff on 7/13, there was room for it to move to the downside if earnings didn't meet expectations. I wanted to make a long play to the downside, but I didn't want to pay to do it, AND if I was wrong, I still wanted to make some money. I chose the 485 as my short strike because it was a little bit below the 20 period moving average; I saw that it has been far above it for multiple days and had a lot of reactions on it. If NFLX were to move to the downside, I was pretty confident that it would move down to the 20 MA, or if it gapped down past it, it would at least try and test it again.\n\n# Managing the trade:\n\nMy exit strategy for if I was wrong was to roll the puts down and out as far as I can and keep the long put. I knew I was wrong if I saw that NFLX could not capture the 20 MA. I exited my position early for this trade for a few reasons: I saw that it was consolidating and could make a big move to the downside or upside soon, because it is monthly OPEX (potential for more volatility), have work to do and didn't want to have to be tied to my trading app, and because this was more leverage than I was comfortable with for my account size. Normally I have multiple units for trades (so like a 2x6, or 3x9) and take profits along the way.\n\nOrder: [https://imgur.com/a/Mh0iyhT](https://imgur.com/a/Mh0iyhT)\n\nDaily chart: [https://imgur.com/a/0TCtB0v](https://imgur.com/a/0TCtB0v)\n\nToday's 5 minute chart: [https://imgur.com/a/pkkc9FH](https://imgur.com/a/pkkc9FH)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this was interesting!",

I just have higher materialistic goals then her. \n\nI am working for 1 year now and i am partner in a small chancellery.\n\nTotal income after taxes wife (21k \u20ac) me (50k): 61k/y or 5k/m\nCost of living per month: 1.4k \n\nWe are both very ecenomical and are sitting a house at the beach till the summer of 2023 which allows us to only pay 300\u20ac/m of rent.\n\nMy goal is to be financialy free (1.5m in stocks + maybe 2-3 flats for renting to tourists) at the age of 50 with a payed off house. We want to build the house in 2022 so we can move in in 2023. \n\nOur house will cost us aproximatly 800k-900k. Its expensive here at the beach but we want the quality of life not to go down.\n\nI dont care about prestige. I will drive used cars worth 5k forever. If i have to show off in front of clients i rent a car or use the car of one of my partners and pay them something.\n\nIn 2019 we both finished the law exams and started working in august 2023.\n\nWe started with 10k cash 1 year ago. Started investing in Dec 2019.\n\nPortfolio:\n\n20k Cash\n\n40k stocks\n\nMSFT 12k (up 10%)\n\nAmzn 9k (up 72%)\n\nGoogl 6k (up 3%)\n\nMA 6k (up 13%)\n\nJPM 2k (down 5%)\n\nINTC 5k (down 17%)\n\nOPTION A: \nWe have the chance to buy a 71sqm flat 100m from the beach for 250k. Its build in 1970 and we need to invest 50k to make it a modern and flooded with light. \n\nMy father is an architect. He can help us for free. The price is ok'ish in this overheated market.\n\nOur plan is to use the flat as a vacation rental. This would pay for mortgage and all expenses and leave ~ 100 \u20ac/m of free cash flow. We can rent it for 150\u20ac/d in the summertime. I expect 160 booked days per year.\n\nPos: \n-we  create a steady small income stream\n- after 20 years we payed off the mortgage and have a nice asset\n- we use debt to create wealth which ensures we dont suffer under a possible hyperinflation in our allocation phase before we invest our money into our own house\n\nCons:\n- additional effort for renting the flat  via airbnb\n- i would have to sell all my stocks right now\n- risk of things like roof damage and other unforseen things\n- all savings are bound in the flat\n- maybe not enough savings until we plan to buy our own property in 2022\n- my own inexperience concerning this matter\n\nOPTION B:\n\nWe dont buy the flat and keep investing 1k/ month in etfs waiting for a nice entry points like in march and save up via this way until we buy our property.\n\nI am interested in your comments! \nSry for my bad english skills. \n\nHave a nice saturday",

        "selftext": "Hello! Would really appreciate if I could get your feedback on my current portfolio / any advice on how to improve :)\n\nA bit of background on myself: I am 29 years old from Singapore and had put in about half my savings into 'safe' Singapore stocks pre-COVID (mainly local banks and the STI ETF) because my friends / family recommended that I do this (instead of leaving my money in the bank) years back when I was just starting out and had absolutely 0 knowledge about investing. I am currently down about US$11k but plan to keep the $ in for long term anyway.\n\nOnly at the height of COVID, some time in March, did I turn my attention to overseas exchanges (big regret starting so late). Since then I have pumped in about US$85k and to date I am up around US$14k overall. I mainly started with small positions to test the waters but added to my positions / bought new stocks over the last 4 months.\n\nThis is my current portfolio w rough stock weightage:\n\nSE 21% FVRR 13% PINS 8% NIO 7% TCEHY 7% AMZN 4% NFLX 4% BABA 3% GOOGL 3% FB 2% PDD 2% JD 2% ATVI 2% DIS 2% WDAY 2% MA 2% XOM 2% BP 2% V 1% MCD 1% AIR 1% KO 1% HLT 1% MAR 1% CINE 1% CCL 1% NCLH 1% DAL 1% PLAY 1% UAA 1%\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n* I know I have far too many stocks and am spread WAY too thin... have been wanting to trim and consolidate for a while. Admittedly I didn't really know what I was doing at the beginning and just bought small positions in many stocks :'(\n* I got greedy and bought some really bad stocks during the early June offline rally (i.e. airlines, cruises and PLAY) and I am kicking myself now. But hoping not to sell off any at a loss if possible to hold longer and wait for spikes\n* I am extremely bullish on tech, esp e-comm (clearly), mainly because I have been working in this industry and closely following big tech since I graduated from uni. Witnessed and experienced first-hand the rapid growth of e-comm in Southeast Asia and am very aware of the untapped potential. Unfortunately I had neither the foresight nor the gall to buy these stocks earlier\u2026\n* All the money I have invested has been accrued from years of working, saving, and being stingy lol + profits from a small e-comm side business I run -- none from my parents!",

        "selftext": "This was posted on one of the Facebook Groups.  I figured I would copy it and share it here.  I have not seen this ticker mentioned on this board before.  Low Flow stock, but does not appear to be any active pump and dump going on.  Seems like this may be starting on an uptrend to fill some gaps.  \n\n\"NeuroMetrix, Inc., (NURO) is a healthcare company that develops and  markets products for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of  peripheral nerve and spinal cord disorders. One of their more  interesting products is Quell, a wearable device for relief of chronic  intractable pain, such as nerve pain due to diabetes and lower back  problems.   The company offers its products to consumers, retail  merchandisers, direct response TV promoters, health care professionals,  managed care organizations, endocrinologists, podiatrists, physicians,  neurologists, and physical medicine and rehabilitation centers, as well  as primary care, internal medicine, orthopedic, hand, and neurosurgeons.   While operating out of out of Woburn, MA. NeuroMetrix has a presence  in Europe, Japan, China, the Middle East, and Mexico. The company has a  strategic collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. NeuroMetrix, Inc. was  founded in 1996.\n\nWhy do I like this play?  Well, there is no  pending catalyst.  Truthfully, the company has had some problems in the  past few years, but a reverse split and a few other moves have the stock  price moving in a favorable direction.  So, yes - - this is more of a  chart play...and I do love the chart. \n\nNeuroMetrix gained 4.65%  in the last trading day (Friday, 7th Aug 2020), rising from $2.15 to  $2.25 , and has now gained 3 days in a row. This is a LOW FLOW stock  (3.75m), so it can really move if volume takes over.  For example,  during daily trading it  fluctuated 7.08% from a day low at $2.12 to a  day high of $2.27.  The price has risen in 6 of the last 10 days and is  up by 14.21% over the past 2 weeks. Volume has increased in the last day  along with the price, which is a positive technical sign, and, in  total, 186 thousand more shares were traded than the day before. In  total, 722 thousand shares were bought and sold for approximately $1.62  million.\n\nIt will be exciting to see whether it manages to continue gaining or take a minor break for the next few days\n\n But looking more at the chart, one reason it has risen is the lack of  strong resistance. On a 4 HR chart the 9MA has crossed the 100 MA and  the stock began trading in confirmation this past week.  NURO blew past  resistence levels around 2.16.  The next resistence levels are low  $2.40s and high $2.50s.  After that, there is a big gap to fill before  getting to $3.35 and $6.20.   I am a big fan of \u201cU-Shaped\u201d charts that  fill gaps and I suspect that NURO is on that path. \"\n\nI am going to get in on this.  I like the upside potential. Anyone have any experience with this ticker or thoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5v6xtg43vzf51.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd7f12136a445f8ef81827dab041d39fbe508627",
