Their particular submission per the wording of the 510k rule is that they are saying that the device has not been changed or modified to the extent that its safety or effectiveness has been compromised. Nanox is not saying that the product is the same as other products, but that it was not changed in such a way to make it a fundamentally new product that would require a lengthy approval process!\n\nNANOX's filing for FDA clearance was submitted and finally accepted by the Third Party Program of FDA.

Also see the status of patents granted and SEC filing regarding the final submission to the FDA of the required data posted in the top of this thread (trying to minimize links for Reddit). Application made as early as 2013.\n\nNext, Citron posted a photo of what they call NNOX\u2019s \u201cR&amp;D\u201d lab. The photo they used is actually a manufacturing clean room for the MeMs X-ray chip at the University of Tokyo.

Data used for the FDA was gathered at this site, Halper notes. With respect to customer orders, the analyst says he's \"very comfortable\" with the clients that were disclosed in the company's filings. He continues to expect Nano-X Imaging to install 15,000 digital X-ray units by 2024 and for peak revenue to reach $900M by 2026.

The latest update on this is that the article is written and just awaiting approval from SA. \n\nThe company itself will be coming out with a rebuttal after running it by PR, legal, their clients and partners, etc. They started unlocking several videos to the public that debunk the report.\n\nThe company is presenting at Oppenheimer\u2019s Virtual Fall Healthcare Life Sciences &amp; MedTech Summit, which goes from Sept 21-23. Their particular presentation is scheduled for Tuesday, September 22at 9:10am ET.\n\nFDA approval expected in Q1.

The next day, citron and friends took short positions and drove the low float stock down. The day after that, the released their short report first thing in the morning. It is low float and there is a huge short interest. It is currently at $28. Cantor, Jeffries, and oppenheimer all provided targets in the $60s-$70s. There should be a major squeeze. My own target is a double to a triple in the next 2-3 weeks. 10x if you have balls of steel and hold till FDA approval.\n\nDYODD!",

        "selftext": "What is volatility? How is it computed?\n-&gt; Real life examples\n\nVolatility is a key factor to take into account when building a portfolio in order to qualify if an asset is more or less risky.\nVolatility appears in Modern Portfolio Theory and has gained a wide acceptance across the financial industry.\n\nWhat is volatility?\n\nVolatility refers to the amount of uncertainty related to the size of changes in price.\nIt is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, in particular an asset is called volatile when there are big swings in price in either directions.\n\nVolatility is relevant because:\n\nThe wider the swings in an investment's price, the harder emotionally it is to not worry\nIt can define position sizing in a portfolio\nPrice volatility presents opportunities to buy assets cheaply and sell when overpriced\n\nMATHEMATICAL DEFINITION (see figure attached)\n\nThe volatility is just the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of a quantity, the returns. It reflects the average amount a stock's price has differed from the mean over a period of time.\n\nVolatility is without a unit and is expressed as a percentage. While variance captures the dispersion of returns around the mean of an asset in general, volatility is a measure of that variance bounded by a specific period of time.\n\nWe can report daily volatility, weekly, monthly, or annualized volatility\n\nVOLATILITY IN REAL LIFE\n\nI computed the annualized volatility of different U.S. stocks using data from Yahoo Finance (see figure attached)\n\nThe annualized volatility of these stocks is in the range of 20-40% with an outlier: Netflix (NFLX) at 52%. Also, UPS and IBM have the lowest volatility of the group.\n\nIf we plot the prices of NFLX and IBM as a function of time we see a lot more variations on NFLX than on IBM (see figure attached)\n\nThe overall performance of Netflix is very good, so volatility is not a bad thing. However holding this stock would have been quite emotional, especially in the past 2-3 years.\n\nVolatility is not only useful to characterize stocks, it is also used for everything that has a price. Let's look at the annualized volatility of different assets (see figure attached)\n\n\nTo summarize:\n- Volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty related to the size of changes in price\n- Volatility is often associated with risk: the higher the volatility, the riskier the asset\n- The higher the volatility the harder emotionally it is to not worry\n\nFull article: https://thenextwave.blog/volatility/",

        "selftext": "(no promotional content, no affiliate links)\n\nHi,\n\nexactly four years ago, I started copying eToro investors / traders that I selected using the broker's built-in search engine (profitable in last two years, already being copied by others), followed by manual filtering, to take into account fluctuations in yearly returns, composition of their portfolios etc. With that, I got a list of 10 people whom I started to copy on a demo account:\n\n[https://www.investing-scientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/etoro\\_1.jpg](https://www.investing-scientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/etoro_1.jpg)\n\nIn the screenshot you can see that in case of the first two of them the amount invested was $10,000, while for the rest it was just $100. This is because I started copying the first two a couple of weeks earlier; eventually I changed this into $100 the same day I made the screenshot and this is when my calculations start - so this thing is irrelevant,  I just cannot travel in time to make another screenshot.\n\nWhat I did after that?\n\nWell, within the next six weeks my profits oscillated between -$11 and +$9.50 (the biggest profit was on Nov 9, a day after US presidential elections). I found this \"boring\" and discontinued experimenting with copy trading.\n\nToday I looked back at those ten traders. Here is what I found. Firstly, seven of them are not with eToro anymore; investorNo1, Simple-Stock-Mkt, tradingrelax, 4exPirate, primit, Gallojack, xjurokx. The other three traders are:\n\n* toppertrader: not being copied by anyone and for a good reason: his loss this year alone is 61.16%!\n* Jean-marcLenfant: copied by only 67 people; his loss this year is -1.09% but in general he is quite successful, with yearly profits ranging from 3.57% to 7.32%.\n* Girem2: he has no copiers, his profit this year is 41.45% but in 2018 he experienced a loss of 83.15%!\n\nMy observations and thoughts are as follows:\n\n1. Seven out of ten traders are not with eToro anymore, which makes me wonder why. I have no proof but my guess is they simply performed poorly, lost their copiers and closed their accounts. This is already alarming but what if they opened another account? Or, even worse, multiple accounts? They could be investing small money and try different risky approaches, hoping that at least one account will turn out profitable in the long turn, attracting potential copiers. (I'm not claiming that those 7 particular traders did this, it's just my general suspicion regarding some of eToro traders)\n2. I'm unable to calculate what would be my profit if I never stopped copying them, because I cannot check at what day and with what profit those seven traders left eToro. I'm guessing this would be an immense loss. On the other hand, considering the three traders who are still with eToro, I would **lose more than a quarter** of my assets!\n\nWhat now?\n\nI must be a quite adventurous person or at least an incorrigible optimist, because a month ago (exactly on Aug 26th) I started copying three traders with real money.

My trades are based on technical analysis using machine learning to understand patterns and trends in the markets. I prefer to keep a diverse portfolio to spread risk while achieving great returns.\"\n* she [gave an interview for Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-12/six-things-you-re-doing-wrong-when-buying-stocks-on-your-own) a couple of weeks ago\n* own experience: I just happened to run across her second worst month ever on eToro; my loss is **-6.27%** at the time of writing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OlivierDanvel](https://www.etoro.com/portfolio/olivierdanvel) (Olivier Jean Andre Danvel)\n\n* he is a Forex trader, making typically 21 trades per week; his favorite currency pairs are EURCHF (12% of trades), CADCHF and GBPUSD; the trades, however, typically make up below 5% of his portfolio (at least whenever I'm checking it), making most of my funds unused\n* active since January 2017: surprisingly enough, he has every single month profitable, though monthly profits are in the range of 0.03% to 3.34% only\n* has 8977 copiers and more than $5M of copy assets under management\n* **strategy (his own words)**: \"I monitor currency pairs all day to find the best entry. There is some management/scaling position for perfect entry. The risk control is a big part of my strategy,\" (quite vague, to be honest)\n* own experience: my current profit is **0.26%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[rayvahey](https://www.etoro.com/portfolio/rayvahey) (Raymond Noel Vahey)\n\n* commodities compose 76% of his portfolio and his favorite assets are Gold and Oil (at the moment, Gold makes up half of invested amount)\n* active since July 2016, with the following  yearly profits, starting from 2016: 6.56%, 10.05%, 13.09%, 32.26% and -2.03% (the current year)\n* has 1493 copiers and $1M-$2M of copy assets under management\n* **strategy (his own words)**: \"My system is based on patterns, and a variety of technical analysis tools and some fundamental analysis. I primarily trade in commodities. \" (quite vague as well)\n* own experience: my profit with rayvahey is **2.56%**\n\nWhat was my strategy to hand-pick these particular traders? First I did some basic scanning using eToro's built-in search engine. The most important filter was that the trader was profitable within the last two years: unfortunately, eToro does not allow to reach details of earlier performance automatically. To know how the trader performed before 2019, I had to look at stats in the profile of each of them. I was also taking into account how often they trade (to avoid those who do only a couple of trades yearly), whether they were trading recently and whether they write posts regularly in their feed. With this, I got a list of fifteen candidates to copy:\n\n* olivierdanvel\n* marianopardo\n* rubymza\n* rayvahey\n* martidg97\n* overit\n* misterg23\n* knw500\n* jianswang\n* reinhardtcoetzee\n* miyoshi\n* alderique\n* jarodd76\n* benson9904\n* big-profits\n\nAs you already know, I finally chose three of them. Rubymza seemed to be the most trustworthy stock trader, based on profits, posts feed and regular trading, among other things.  Regarding OlivierDanvel, his uniqueness is the ability to record continuous profits with the Forex market. Finally, with rayvahey I wanted to increase my exposure to the commodities market.\n\nWish me good luck!\n\n*Michael*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.\n\nYou might find those copy-trading related readings interesting:\n\n* https://www.etoro.com/copytrader/\n* https://www.investopedia.com/etoro-review-5072808\n* https://socialtradingvlog.com/\n* https://stockupwithjoe.com/etoro-copy-trader/\n* https://blockonomi.com/etoro-copy-trading-guide/\n* https://www.quora.com/Does-copying-best-traders-concept-of-etoro-really-work\n* https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-get-rich-by-copying-the-trades-of-top-traders-in-eToro-Zulu-trade/answer/Lutz-Enke\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclosures**:\n\n* What you see here is my personal opinion, my own investments and should not be treated as investing advice\n* I\u2019m an amateur investor",

Also, look who posted this publicly available scan, John Nosta: [https://twitter.com/JohnNosta/status/1305563182333820932?s=20](https://twitter.com/JohnNosta/status/1305563182333820932?s=20).\n\nHere are his comments on the company: [https://twitter.com/JohnNosta/status/1306705844223070219](https://twitter.com/JohnNosta/status/1306705844223070219)\n\nNext, Citron says they spent only 6-13M in R&amp;D **but CONVENIENTLY leave out that the tech was developed by SONY who spent $1.1 BILLION on development** and it was then acquired by NNOX who developed it for the x-ray, ctscan applications **for an additional 8 years**.\n\nNext, Citron says that their filing of a 510k means their product is not novel, which is entirely misleading. Their particular submission per the wording of the 510k rule is that they are saying that the device has not been changed or modified to the extent that its safety or effectiveness has been compromised. Nanox is not saying that the product is the same as other products, but that it was not changed in such a way to make it a fundamentally new product that would require a lengthy approval process!\n\nNANOX's filing for FDA clearance was submitted and finally accepted by the Third Party Program of FDA. They don't accept the filing if they don't satisfy the requirements they demanded. The approvals are announced EVERY 5TH DAY OF THE MONTH for the approvals during the previous month according to the FDA 501K rule. Also see the status of patents granted and SEC filing regarding the final submission to the FDA of the required data posted in the top of this thread (trying to minimize links for Reddit). Application made as early as 2013.\n\nNext, Citron posted a photo of what they call NNOX\u2019s \u201cR&amp;D\u201d lab. The photo they used is actually a manufacturing clean room for the MeMs X-ray chip at the University of Tokyo. Since they are manufacturing isn\u2019t that past the R&amp;D phase? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hp6zo0blyio51.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cc278c97458dce4750c4358a1556fd01d44e7a4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short report unfounded, says Cantor Fitzgerald, 70 USD target** Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper tells investors in a research note. On concerns over published data, the analyst points out that Nano-X's prototype device has been in place at Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem, a \"large and well-known\" hospital in Israel. Data used for the FDA was gathered at this site, Halper notes. With respect to customer orders, the analyst says he's \"very comfortable\" with the clients that were disclosed in the company's filings. He continues to expect Nano-X Imaging to install 15,000 digital X-ray units by 2024 and for peak revenue to reach $900M by 2026. Halper reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares with a $70 price target\n\nWatch this webcast with Cantor: [https://www.webcaster4.com/Player/Index?webcastId=37467&amp;g=8ccb0e8a-f6e5-430e-8dd9-12eac96863c9&amp;uid=6084268&amp;sid=](https://www.webcaster4.com/Player/Index?webcastId=37467&amp;g=8ccb0e8a-f6e5-430e-8dd9-12eac96863c9&amp;uid=6084268&amp;sid=)\n\nThere's another on their website with Jeffries if you're not too lazy in investors/event section of Nanox's website. Jeffries also gave them target of $66 IIRC\n\nThese are some of their partners, backers, advisors and investors:\n\n1. GE\n2. Siemens\n3. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation\n4. Fujifilm\n5. Sony\n6.

The latest update on this is that the article is written and just awaiting approval from SA. \n\nThe company itself will be coming out with a rebuttal after running it by PR, legal, their clients and partners, etc. They started unlocking several videos to the public that debunk the report.\n\nThe company is presenting at Oppenheimer\u2019s Virtual Fall Healthcare Life Sciences &amp; MedTech Summit, which goes from Sept 21-23. Their particular presentation is scheduled for Tuesday, September 22at 9:10am ET.\n\nFDA approval expected in Q1. That said, there is a small possibility that FDA approval will come on the 5th of any of the coming months. Again \" The approvals are announced EVERY 5TH DAY OF THE MONTH for the approvals during the previous month according to the FDA 501K rule\"\n\nThe stock is down 60%. It was at $66. The next day, citron and friends took short positions and drove the low float stock down. The day after that, the released their short report first thing in the morning. It is low float and there is a huge short interest. It is currently at $28. Cantor, Jeffries, and oppenheimer all provided targets in the $60s-$70s. There should be a major squeeze. My own target is a double to a triple in the next 2-3 weeks. 10x if you have balls of steel and hold till FDA approval.\n\nDYODD!",
