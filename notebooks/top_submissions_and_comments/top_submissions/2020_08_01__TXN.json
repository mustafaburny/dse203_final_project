You could've exited anytime on Friday for a profit except the last 15 mins of trading.  AAPL stock split enthusiasm and tiktok buyout rumors by MSFT(now canned) drove it past 325 eclipsing the stimulus paycheck pause\n\nLooking into next week, again for the SPY we need to think in terms of Geopolitik Say AMZN struck a deal in South Asia and MENA regions, they're set to dominate the ecommerce market there, oh just one problem. all the goods from vietnam / US can't get there because the South China Sea is being blockaded. Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages. Whoops won't matter if they are banned in Asia due to US loosing allies over there. Tiktok case is the reverse example of this.\n\nWho makes the most money ultimately comes down to who have MORE GUNS(and wins wars),  we will see how this play out over the next few months along with the rona pandemic. It's been this way for thousands of years ever since Roman times. This view is also echoed by the world's biggest Hedge Funds.\n\n***\"Ray Dalio's, chairman of Bridgewater capital(160B AUM) 2nd article on Geopolitics\"***\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio/)\n\n&gt;Governance between countries is very different from governance within countries.  That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.  Operating internationally is like operating in a jungle in which there is survival of the fittest and most anything goes.  That is what makes having a strong military so important.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where the US Is in Its Big Cycle The stats seem to suggest that the US is roughly 75% through that cycle, +/- 10%.

        "selftext": "I tried posting in the quarterly thread but didn\u2019t get any attention. \n\nLooking for a little discussion/direction. I have a business minor, a good understanding of personal finance, am quite experienced in funding my own retirement accounts and understanding their tax implications. However, I\u2019ve just never bothered to take the time to get into really buckling down for the stock market. I\u2019m in my 20s and mostly started picking my stock game up during March - I\u2019ve bought stuff in the past, particularly penny stocks while taking finance classes in college. Here\u2019s what I have representing approx $4k in value, why I bought it, and what I might plan to do with it - percentages are rounded:\n\n\n**PCG (10.2%)**\n\nI first bought this back in 2017 during what I thought was the big dip. Then there was a second wildfire caused by them and it slide further and further until I averaged my cost down near its low around $6. I currently have that many shares on a sell order for when it hits $10 but sometimes I feel like just dumping it altogether and moving the money on to something more useful to invest in.\n\n\n**AAL (4.3%)**\n\nI got this near one of its lows close to $13. This was more or less of a gamble since I saw that there was some room for medium term gains as long as they don\u2019t bk. I work in the industry and have a strong sense of its direction so I\u2019ll keep this for now until I sense things going a different direction (I don\u2019t work for AAL in any capacity)\n\n**BOXL (3.2%)**\n\nThis is just a Covid gamble. I feel dumb for getting sucked into it but it\u2019s only a little bit of money lost if it never goes anywhere.\n\n**NET (14.7%)**\n\nJust a company I\u2019ve know for a long time. There\u2019s a lot of emotion behind this one, but its objective metrics are strong anyway so I plan on continuing to find my position on this one if things continue going well.\n\n**KO (29.7%)**\n\nI first bought into Coke in 2018 as a long-term value sink and its ability to retain value while growing at a rate better than a HYSA has been just fine with me. I plan to continue adding to this.\n\n\n**TXN (32.9%)**\n\nA company with a strong history and strong fundamentals. One of my recent additions as a long-term value sink. I plan to continue adding to this.\n\n**VNQ (4.2%)**\n\nVery recently bought into this. I want to be exposed to the real estate market as well med-long term without buying an actual building so I figured a respected real estate etf made sense. I\u2019m wondering if going for a muni bond based etf would make more sense though. This is my \u201cnon-stock\u201d holdings that should take priority as I get older. \n\n\nRecent Specs:\n\nI've only specced on a couple of things so far, but so far so good. I've made roughly 20% in YTD gain yield off of some small working buying and selling SPCE and WFC.",

        "selftext": "Probably an embarrassing thing to admit, but I \\*do\\* have memories of a calculator when I was growing up.  In high school, we needed to have a graphing calculator and it wasn't long before we realized we could load (basic) games on it and waste time rather than paying attention in class.  The calculator of choice, of course, was by Texas Instruments (Ticker: TXN). My first was a hand-me-down TI-82, and I later upgraded to the luxurious (in those days) TI-89 when I went off to college.  It played even better games ...\n\nWhile I associate Texas Instruments with their calculators, that portion of their business is relatively small - buried in their \"Other\" product categories.  TXN is a semiconductor design and manufacturing company.  Semiconductors accounted for about 69% of their profit in 2019, embedded processors about 22% and \"other\" about 9%.  \n\nThis week, we look at a bullish play in TXN:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[6 Month Chart of TXN](https://preview.redd.it/nojewtfknme51.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8838c9965873f9e8d7fe9d89c276d5f45788ae5)\n\n* Want shares for the long term? Sell a cash secured put: August 21st 120 put for 1.22 \n* Want a trade? Sell a put spread: Sell the August 21st 120 put and buy the 115 call for 0.60 net credit \n* Prices are at the midpoint as of 7/31/2020\n* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.\n\nWall Street expected 0.88 in earnings recently and TXN came in at 1.48.  TXN then sold off...  A reminder that post earnings performance is never 'obvious'!  With TXN down, one can sell a put and take ownership of shares \"on sale\" if it continues to fall for the next three weeks.  \n\nTXN pays a solid dividend of $3.60 on an annual basis, up from 1.40 in 2015.  I expect it will continue to increase over time.  If we are assigned at 120, we'll receive a 3% yield on our shares.  This coupled with selling covered calls on the position could net a nice return while waiting for the shares to rebound.\n\nIf we aren't assigned, we'll receive a bit over a 1% return on our risk (1.22/118.78).  Total risk is defined as TXN going bankrupt and its shares becoming worthless ($0). With portfolio margin, there is a buying power impact of about $1115.  \n\nFor the put spreads, we are risking $440 to make $60.  If it expires worthless our return on risk will therefore be 13.6%.  \n\n**Why else do we like this trade?**\n\nIV has come down since earnings, but it has remained well above historical volatility.  If you review IV and HV for even longer, you'll see that the IV is actually near the pre-COVID high end of the range as well.\n\nEarnings are behind us and the dividend was just paid, so there are no near term events in the underlying.\n\n**What can go wrong?**\n\nThe market or the stock could tank.  The stock is pricing in a $6.88 move by expiration, which if it is to the downside, would be Above our short strike.  Still, this is an Estimate and the stock could drop much more.  We'll lose money below 118.78 at expiration for the short put or below 119.40 on the put spread.\n\nThe market overall could drop due to COVID-19 or one of many other macro events.  As always, we place trades within our risk guidelines knowing that almost anything can happen.\n\n**Side note -** \n\nI realize this trade idea is a bit similar to last week's although very different names and some different reasoning (Side Side note - last week's trade can already be closed for half the profit) .  I like the vol profile more on this and while I don't share all my trades, this one offered some additional concepts.\n\nQuestions/Comments?",
