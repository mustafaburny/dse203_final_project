I had a very simple strategy where I would buy a stock sometime before the date of earnings (to be calibrated also) and either sell it if it rises or hold on until it recovers (if it ever does). I looked at historic movements to spot stocks with highest potential to do +/-5% move, and filter to keep those with minimum recovery periods. Recovery is basically when the stock price meets the price before the earnings release.\n\nI compiled all this into this dashboard where you can look at these numbers by symbol here: [earnings-watcher.tech](https://earnings-watcher.tech/)\n\nHere are some symbols with lowest/highest recovery periods:\n\n**$MMI, $AMPH, $EVH, $SNPS**: around *1 day*\n\n**$NEOG, $BNGO, $MAGS:** around *40 days*\n\n**$ENG, $KODKL**: around *100 days*\n\nHappy to hear your thoughts and discuss the code if interested.
