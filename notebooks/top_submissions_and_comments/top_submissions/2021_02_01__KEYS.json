Wednesday we'll have them covered in piss and shit as we walk away with the keys to their summer vacation home.

Until we stop using phones, computers, anything with a PCB in it, that industry will grow.\n\nAnyone have good long plays in there? I think the top companies would be chip makers, chemical companies, and then the real secret area, all the companies that make automation for the semiconductor process (Applied Materials, TEL, LAM Research, etc). I'm also interested in analytical chemistry related companies. That science will be critical in developing better chips. The chip makers are really limited by chemical cleanliness.

        "selftext": "Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!\n\nTo start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their \"overweight\" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.\n\nThe goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.\n\nI'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating\n\n1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)\n\nI believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio\n\nNow we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)\n\n2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)\n\n Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.\n\n3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)\n\nNow we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative\n\n4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)\n\nThat list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.\n\n5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.\n\nOh and positions: 20 VOO, 62 QQQ, 28 LIT, and 54 PLTR. If you made it to the end of this post, thank you!",

It is incredibly difficult to find long entries at current price levels, not to mention social media is trying to get EVERY  stock below a buck over one dollar. Tread lightly out there, as I still feel a correction coming on. My first three pics are small cap companies, BUT they are between $8-$12 which is above r/pennystocks definition of a penny stock. I would rather give you a setup I believe in then shove a cheap stock down your throat. Hoping my OTC plays recently (VEPR and ENZC) have benefitted you greatly.   \n\n\n***$COTY:***\n\nShares of  Coty Inc.  (COTY) rose 2.9% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the beauty products company reported fiscal second-quarter adjusted profit that declined less than expected, while sales fell a bit shy. The net loss for the quarter to  Dec. 31  widened to  $275.4 million , or  36 cents  a share, from from  $21.1 million , or  3 cents  a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share fell to  17 cents  from  27 cents , but was above the FactSet consensus of  7 cents . Revenue declined 15.9% to  $1.415 billion , just below the FactSet consensus of  $1.433 billion , as sales in the  Americas  and EMEA ( Europe ,  Middle East  and  Africa ) regions missed expectations while  Asia Pacific  beat. The company said despite continued disruptions to sales and short-term orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it will start raising commercial investments ahead of fiscal 2022, while the company raised its full-year cost cutting target to  $300 million . The stock has soared 78.4% over the past three months through Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 10.3%.\n\nLackluster earnings BUT the chart speaks for itself. Will be looking for an entry after the stock falls back down to previous resistance turned support, which tends to happen on a lot of these flags. Stock is still trading well under pre-pandemic levels.\n\n*Processing img lf6y7m3p6gg61...*\n\n***$LLIT: (Update)***\n\nLLIT merging with Newegg, presented us with a dip into the 20ma for an entry in the 6.20's, and has since been silently chugging in the background.

        "selftext": "Hello fellow retards\n\nI know these are difficult times for this sub and it\u2019s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.\n\nInstead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.\n\nThe following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn\u2019t my native language. I will try my best.\n\n**Palantir as a Company \u2013 the beginnings**\n\nPLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this \u2013 Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government\u2026.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.\n\nYou retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji\u2019s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the DD\n\nFirst of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **1. The Management**\n\nBefore I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won\u2019t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**\n\nBefore we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don\u2019t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don\u2019t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers\u2019 base isn\u2019t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That\u2019s the reason why their products aren\u2019t so tangible for many people.\n\nPLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn\u2019t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called \u201cGraham\u201d and \u201cFoundry\u201d You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:\n\nFirst example is Syria with Graham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the \u201crest of the world\u201d for you. But this wasn\u2019t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information\u2019s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.\n\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)\n\nActually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.\n\nIn their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way\n\n\u201cGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.\u201d\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)\n\nThe second example is about \u201cFoundry\u201d and it\u2019s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)\n\n\u201cAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.\u201d\n\nBoth of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the \u201cmachine\u201d with data.\n\nThe key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**\n\nPeter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)\n\nBut this didn\u2019t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like \u201elook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions\u201c. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn\u2019t get the contracts. This was also the \u201eswamp \u201etrump was talking about.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html)\n\nA fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.\n\n*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*\n\n[https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software)\n\nEven with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn\u2019t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.\n\n[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)\n\n[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)\n\nHow it\u2019s ended? Well Peter\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and \u201ebest practices \u201ein the government\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/)\n\nPLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **4. Valuation problems**\n\nI could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it\u2019s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It\u2019s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn\u2019t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.\n\nNow back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.\n\nPLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)\n\nMorgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.\n\nThese guys are very focused on numbers and I know it\u2019s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can\u2019t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.\n\nThis ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)\n\nHow is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don\u2019t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don\u2019t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don\u2019t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That\u2019s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn\u2019t happened yet. That\u2019s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.\n\nGuys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn\u2019t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.\n\nLook at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I\u2019m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash\u2026\n\nOn page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.\n\nPLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it\u2019s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don\u2019t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **5. Risks for PLTR**\n\nDespite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: \u201cWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\u201d The S1 Form didn\u2019t aged well. Actually I don\u2019t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.\n\nAs PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn\u2019t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.\n\nI think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.\n\nThere are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can\u2019t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It\u2019s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.\n\nThe risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren\u2019t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn\u2019t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)\n\nBut even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000\u00a7. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**\n\nIf you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let\u2019s connect the dots and bring this information to a point\n\n1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!\n2. Military expenditures rising worldwide\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2\n\n[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)\n\nWith Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.\n\n3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don\u2019t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don\u2019t work with it but big Institutions does.\n\nHere is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:\n\n\u201cThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public \u2014 fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars \u2014 will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.\u201d\n\n4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don\u2019t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.\n\nFacebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn\u2019t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.\n\nA remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don\u2019t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before\u2026.\n\nPLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.\n\n5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It\u2019s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I\u2019m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don\u2019t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.\n\nI have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.\n\nIf all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..\n\n**What\u2019s next?**\n\nNow we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.\n\nFor the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.\n\nThe second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don\u2019t got the GM deal? The stock tanked \u2013 for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.\n\nBut in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don\u2019t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.\n\nI would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3\u00df. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don\u2019t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid \u2013 long term.\n\nWhat does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don\u2019t do any market activity based on my DD. I\u2019m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.\n\nMy hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized \u201cthe pumpers\u201d. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don\u2019t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.\n\nI\u2019m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!\n\nLeave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!",

The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 \ufffc (PSX).\n\nThe SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.\n\nThe mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nGary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.\n\nBlack has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company\u2019s lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.\n\nIn recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire\u2019s holding in Goldman Sachs Group \ufffc (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase \ufffc (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo \ufffc (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie \ufffc (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb \ufffc (BMY).\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nI think if Buffett select, it could be stable dividend payers such as xom, cvx and hd.

        "selftext": "This is my first DD post on any company, be gentle.\n\nDisclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I\u2019m not a professional, I\u2019m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy\u2019s.\n\nSources used: RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.\n\n\u200b\n\nSummary\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.\n\nRKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future\nRKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.\nThe RKT \u201cecosystem\u201d provides a \u201cfull cycle\u201d solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it\u2019s an app, it\u2019s online, it\u2019s doable from home and it\u2019s not complicated. There\u2019s an inherent advantage in what they\u2019re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that\u2019s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there\u2019s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.\nRKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.\nRKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).\nRKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they\u2019re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That\u2019s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.\nRKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That\u2019s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.\nKey Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company\n\nThe average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.\n\nThis estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. What\u2019s key here is, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.\n\nLet\u2019s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think it\u2019s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it\u2019s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.\n\nKey Point - Catalysts\n\nThis thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I\u2019m buying shares, I\u2019m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don\u2019t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.\n\nSupporting information and background follows.\n\nThe Business\n\nRKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:\n\nHome Financing\n\nRocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent \u201cpublic facing\u201d part of the Rocket ecosystem.\nAmrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as \u201csupporting infrastructure\u201d to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.\nAmrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The \u201cbusiness end\u201d in my simple understanding of the world.\nNexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.\nLendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada\nEdison Financial - Basically the \u201cfront end\u201d of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.\nHome Sale and Search\n\nRocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.\nFor Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it\u2019s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.\nAuto &amp; Personal Financing\n\nRocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.\nRocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.\nMedia\n\nCore Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.\nLower My Bills - this company is basically a \u201cportal\u201d business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.\nServices &amp; Technology Development\n\nRock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.\nRock Central - I will generalize this as \u201cbusiness support\u201d. HR, administration, etc.\nRocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.\nRecent Acquisitions\n\nRKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they\u2019re the ones leading that charge.\n\nManagement\n\nI do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune\u2019s \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d list for 17 consecutive years.\n\nFinancials and Growth\n\nWhen it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don\u2019t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here\u2019s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:\n\n$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.\n\nFrom that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.\n\nNet income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.\n\nClosed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.\n\nNet rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).\n\nRKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. That\u2019s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.\n\nRKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.\n\nQuick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They\u2019ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don\u2019t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.\n\nOk so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I\u2019m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It\u2019s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:\n\nhttps://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr\n\nI don\u2019t believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it\u2019s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.\n\nProduct Channels\n\nRKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don\u2019t lie:\n\nDirect-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)\nPartner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)\nAdjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)\nThe partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.\n\nCurrent Market and outlook\n\nRight now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)\n\nI cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.\n\nHere\u2019s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.\n\nPositions: RKT shares. Cost basis of $21.14.",

        "selftext": "By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n\n\nHere\u2019s some DD for anybody who doesn\u2019t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n\n\neBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That\u2019s just a given. \n\n\nI am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. \n\n\nLots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I\u2019m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn\u2019t why I\u2019m going fucking hard in the calls. Here\u2019s the real cherry on top:\n\neBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it\u2019s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n\n\nWell guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn\u2019t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. \n\nThis is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it\u2019s time we do the same.\n\n\nOh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok\u00e9mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It\u2019s 2021.\n\n\neBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I\u2019ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. \n\n\nTLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this?  When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers.  For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well.   The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.  \n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit.  When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of  payment for your transaction.  The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal? \n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above,  Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments.  To quote,  PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there.  PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all.  PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues.  It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

        "selftext": "1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN",

        "selftext": "Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and it\u2019s only gonna get better as it has for me. Here\u2019s a little of my own DD.\n\nThere is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:\nPoint of sales (POS) terminals\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) payments\nE-commerce solutions\n  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.\nA leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL\u2019s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that\u2019s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. \n\nAs I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square\u2019s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. \n\nThe difference between Zelle and PYPL\u2019s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn\u2019t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved\nin Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it\u2019s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isn\u2019t at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9. Don\u2019t miss this undervalued STRONG company.",

        "selftext": "Thought I'd provide a simple explanation of what Payoneer actually does. Say a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. An individual consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments. \n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer. \n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.",

        "selftext": "I just wanted to provide an update to my initial DD on Payoneer located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ldsbq1/payoneer_ftoc_updated_dd_for_valuation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Specifically, I received some very nice customer feedback from a fellow redditer. I also summarize my thoughts after visiting r/Payoneer. Finally, I offer some thoughts on valuation and why its not as straightforward as just applying a multiple to revenue .\n\n1. **User feedback.** I would very much like to thank [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/), who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer.\\* \n\n* Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles/red tape.\n* A lot of freelancers on [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/)  use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/) can't wire money to.\n* Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n* Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. *However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account.* While Payoneer likes the reputation of being \"a U.S bank account\" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. \n* As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives the users the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. \n* From [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/): \u201cOverall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both from the U.S and abroad.\u201d \n\n2. **Customer service.** After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have a few initial impressions. \n\n* While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer\u2019s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue.  \n* The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer\u2019s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.)\n\n3. **Valuation.** A number of people are comparing Payoneer\u2019s multiple to those of PayPal and Shopify. While these are the right comps, Payoneer's multiple will be determined by its customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (While technically FinTech companies are valued on revenue or earnings/EBITDA its CLTV which will determine the valuation multiple.) There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.\n\nAdditionally, many are looking at Payoneer\u2019s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added service to its customer base initially attracted by low service fees. Once agin, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation\n\nTLDR: Based on first hand feedback, Payoneer proves a very needed service. While the Wirecard scandal and fallout seem to be transitory, Payoneer\u2019s customer service needs to continue to improve. Fortunately, like cable, FinTech customers seem willing to tolerate a certain degree of frustration.  \n\nI definitely believe Payoneer has potential as a long-term buy and hold and is also a likely take-out candidate. While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or \u201cexpanding\u201d in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. \n\n**Disclosure &amp; Disclaimer**\n\nI am not a financial advisor. Please do your own due diligence.\n\nI have the following positions:\n\n1. 1,000 FTOC common shares\n2. 10 February/August Covered      Calls @ $12.50 (short)/$17.50 (long). I intend to write monthly calls      against the long option, which is known as a diagonal spread or poor man's      covered call (PMCC). If anyone has insight into the attractiveness of the      warrants, I would appreciate his/her perspective.",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** $SQ is currently trading at \\~$228. They report their earnings on 02/23 and they're going to crush it! I personally think it's pretty cheap and it'll definitely have a run up. $SQ has two Lines of Businesses: Seller and CashApp. The Seller segment includes Square's managed payment services, software solutions, hardware, and financial services offered to sellers. The Seller segment generated $409.3 million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up 12.5% compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\\*T\\*C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.\n\nHere are my bull points:\n\n**Seller Segment:**\n\n* Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of\n   * Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.\n   * Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.\n* More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -&gt; more people shopping outside -&gt; more small businesses profiting -&gt; more $\n* Most states (including businesses) are open ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)).\n* 2nd round of PPP: Credit lenders approved $5 billion loans in 1 week starting 2nd week of January 2021([https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/)). Small businesses aren't going anywhere and are here to stay.\n\n**CashApp Segment:**\n\n[$SQ vs. $PYPL vs. B\\*T\\*C Relative Pricing Chart](https://preview.redd.it/dktqnolq5df61.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973334c125737ffdef02ed247bdadc27eb5fe56f)\n\n1. There was a very strong correlation between B\\*T\\*C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\\*T\\*C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant. **Not priced in!**\n2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ([https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ)). **Not priced in!**\n3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp. **Not priced in!**\n4. B\\*T\\*C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%. **Not priced in!**\n\n **Other Bullish Points:**\n\n* 1% of $SQ's asset is in B\\*T\\*C. B\\*T\\*C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\\*T\\*C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter. **Probably priced in.**\n* CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:\n\n[App store](https://preview.redd.it/zcuqy9iuddf61.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=983ac6fd8bf65f114c7a2f38849708f7186aef07)\n\n**Bearish Points:**\n\n* The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling\n* $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* EMT\n* B\\*T\\*C doesn't crash before earnings\n\nTake advantage of the low pricing right now to get in and using ER as hedge if you're planning to sell before expiry.",

For example, PayPal totally does not operate in Pakistan, but Payoneer does. Growth in US, Europe is stagnating while emerging markets have potential for triple digit growth.(Payoneer did in fact experience up to 900% growth in Philippines, Vietnam, etc.)\n\nWhat Payoneer lacks now is media coverage, and brand awareness. The average person doesn\u2019t hear about Payoneer because it is B2B, only businesses and sellers use it behind the scenes.\n\nMildly Optimistic case: \n\n- Betsy Cohen (or someone else like Cathie Wood) ups the game and promotes Payoneer for the great company it really is. (Currently the PR promotion and media coverage is really non-existent, to be honest Betsy Cohen is not good at this compared to Chamath.)\n\n\n- Payoneer captures 5% of PayPal\u2019s equivalent market share and hence market cap. PayPal has $300B market cap so that would make Payoneer a $15B company (which is roughly 2-3X its current market cap).\nThat would equate to a solid stock price of $20-$40.\n\nModerate Bull case:\n- Payoneer expands to B2C and directly competes with PayPal head on, capturing 10% of PayPal\u2019s market share. That would make Payoneer a $30B company at around 5X its current market cap, ie $60-$70 stock price.\n\nNote that the above cases does not even require Payoneer beating PayPal, it just requires Payoneer to be worth 5%-10% of PayPal.\n\nBear case (quite unlikely imo):\n\n-Payoneer does not get the media coverage it deserves. No one, even institutions, knows about Payoneer hence low volume in stock trading.\n\n- PayPal totally dominates &gt;95% of the market, does not allow Payoneer to grow to 5-10% of PayPal\u2019s size\n\nPayoneer remains at 2% of PayPal\u2019s size. (This is definitely already achieved based on Payoneer\u2019s revenue of $0.5B vs PayPal\u2019s $18B.) Then, Payoneer is a $6B company which corresponds to $13-14 stock price.\n\n\nReference article (old but still relevant): https://www.paymentsjournal.com/executive-spotlight-series-with-scott-galit-from-payoneer/\n\nHighlights:\n\nHow does Payoneer stand out from other fintech companies?\n\nPayoneer is really a pretty unique FinTech company.\n\n\u2022B2B Focus \u2013 we focus exclusively on business payments. While B2B payments has much larger volume than consumer payments, it has attracted just a fraction of the attention and the investment of B2C\n\n\u2022Global \u2013 we\u2019re a truly global provider and company. We support customers that come from over 200 countries and enable them to transact through us in more than 150 currencies, and settle through more than 170 local clearing systems.

We\u2019re also really strong in emerging markets, with a lot of momentum in SE Asia, India, Latin America and Eastern Europe.\n\n\u2022Scale \u2013 we\u2019re a profitable, well-funded company of more than 600 employees that moves many billions of dollars annually, works with large companies like Amazon, Google and Airbnb, and generates more than $100 million in revenues annually. We have bank relationships and partners all over the world, and have built a robust and redundant global payment infrastructure that ensures our clients get a strong, secure, scalable infrastructure partner they can count on.\n\n\u2022Brand \u2013 our brand has become meaningful, and represents economic empowerment for businesses and professionals all over the world, especially in developing markets.

        "selftext": "Im here to tell you to add $TSNP to your watchlist, do your own DD and take on a position soon if you like what you see. I have searched countless days/hours on this stock and can\u2019t believe my eyes. This company use to be a flooring company and was bought out by HUMBL PAY, a new mobile app similar to PayPal and square, app is launching any day this month.\nThe difference of this app and PayPal/square is this company will be worldwide and target the countries PayPal doesn\u2019t operate in. It\u2019s not just a digital payment method, it\u2019s a digital currency exchange from country to country. If you have family in Mexico, you can send USD and it be converted directly into pesos. They will launch in 40+ countries this month alone.\n\nAnother big part of their business model is Hmbl Financial, this portion of the app is directed towards blockchain and crypto capabilities. The CEO Brian Foote has mastered the blockchain industry and plans to utilize it like no other. He\u2019s a very motivated CEO eager to change the world and very open about it. One of the things I admire about him and the company is PR, they hold investor calls once every other month and have been smashing their timelines. Working 20 hours a day his app is launching 4 months ahead of schedule.\n\nThe third portion of the app, yes another addition...\nIs Humbl Marketplace. A very similar concept of Shopify and Etsy. They will have endless merchants on their market place and you can be one too, they make it so you can launch a business on their platform within a day, and with the crypto and currency exchange within its own app, it\u2019ll be easier than every to buy/sell globally.\n\nRemember, TSNP has ZERO of anything to do with HUMBL beside the fact that humbl bought them out, humbl wanted to shortcut its way to the market and get a ticker already listed. This is 1,000% a different company so don\u2019t judge the balance sheet off of that.\nThe ticker will be changed to $HMBL any day this month and that alone will wake people up that this company is transforming. Humbl hits 3 markets within one app and one day will be globally. The three markets have been proven to be successful and all within one app sounds astounding. Market place/digital currency, crypto buying and selling/world currency exchange. All with lower fees that any competitors.\n\nI rest my case, GLTA.\nBe HMBL.",

Everything you read is highly questionable and accuracy of information is not guaranteed. No financial advice here. I have a significant long position in PSTH. The merger target and date could be incorrect. I\u2019m talking up my book. This is not a research report, just speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis: There is two parts to this speculation**\n\nA. PSTH will merge with Stripe. (For these see A-Exhibits)\n\nB. The announcement will come on Feb 17th. (For these see B-Exhibits)\n\n**What is Stripe?** A payment processing company that competes with Square and PayPal. In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company ra ised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $36 billion. It is currently being valued at $70 billion or more. Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. I\u2019m very familiar with the Irish, and the duo are extremely smart and have European way of thinking and mannerisms. \n\n**Background:** I presented the speculative evidence for Stripe being the target in A-Exhibits and timing in B-exhibits. A lot of these are scraped from various people who have done lots of digging. A speculative trade like this has high risk but also high reward. Nailing the timing on this would be tickets to retirement for some. So SPACs move massively on any news of discussion with a good target. Stripe is in my opinion as sweet honey. I highly doubt that Ackman and all those big investors like Guggenheim would invest in a SPAC without having a solid short list. I think their short list had Bloomberg and Stripe on it. They flirted with AirBnB and Coinbase just to see their chances. If any of those happened or a new sweet target emerged then they would do a quick second SPAC. They used PSTH to grab attention of other companies and see what they can attract for their future SPACs. Kind of like what Chamat did. I speculate that Stripe was their target and Stripe was just spending time getting ready for the Feb 17th announcement. All this is speculation. I also have read speculations about StarLink and Plaid and those really didn\u2019t hold any water. Collison brothers\u2019 way of running their companies has been very European like. Very cooperative and trusting of the process. They didn\u2019t mind giving a big chunk of their company to Y-combinator. They didn\u2019t mind hiring agitators. They just seem to operate like they live in Ireland and everyone is trustable. They are not used to dealing with NYC sharks. They are easy prey for a top predator like AckFuckingMan.  \n\n**Exhibit A-1: Stripe has been going on a hiring spree. 973 job postings vs last year 260** \n\n[https://stripe.com/jobs/search](https://stripe.com/jobs/search)\n\nBelow is how their site looks now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u404o2ce0ah61.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f2b63deb8432098c9ffd7c6f8d5a631276354f\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is how their postings looked in April of 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwqdv8mf0ah61.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622ccdaf94f6b5781f2e2e78be103256bf005c79\n\nHiring needs money!

Bill mentions \u201cManagement\u201d, \u201cInfrastructure\u201d, and \u201csystems\u201d. So that ties into exhibit A-1.

Jackie was the head of capital for square and stepped down. She has also been liking tweets from Ackman. \n\n**Exhibit A-10: Peter Collison interacted with posts about SPAC on Twitter.** \n\nThose were on Jan 8th. They have been deleted since. I could be wrong about this exhibit.\n\n=====================================================================\n\n**Exhibit B-1: Bill Ackman earnings call: Ackman gave a 2021 Q1 target**\n\n[https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA\\~\\~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad](https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA~~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad)\n\nMin 42:30\n\n*\u201cIn terms of timing, what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us, we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter. Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won\u2019t meet our expected timeframe\u201d-* \n\n**Exhibit B-2: The two meetings are right one after another. Seems to be coordinated.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img dqict6sq0ah61...*\n\n**Exhibit B-3: Note the bump in price and volume earlier this week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kc91bnr0ah61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bf1186fb68589b1a38dbccbb91f46d7a0b537dd\n\nThis points to some insiders getting ready for the announcement. \n\n**Exhibit B-4: IV on the call options suggest big imminent news**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/160of5js0ah61.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94de0ac8eac7bbd6b0f281321ee5fb4f432ad818\n\nThis was captured before news of 13G filed on Friday. \n\n**Exhibit B-5: Twitter activity**\n\nOn Feb 8th Bill tweeted a Rap Song about SPACs: [https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096)\n\nBill is not too active on twitter, nor is John Collison.\n\nPatrick and John Collison both had a notable reduction in twitter activity in first week of Feb and all of a sudden they came alive on Feb 8th. This is the day that PSTH shares jumped \\~6% on no news. Insiders buying? There was a lot of unexplained excitement on that day both in twitter behaviour of parties involved and price of PSTH. \n\n**Exhibit B-6: 13G filing by PSH**\n\nNews of raising more money coming out just now! See 13G filled on **2/12/21** after hours. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm) \n\nI think there is a lot of confusion about this. People are saying that it is PSH increasing the PIPE, and this is pointing to a bigger deal. I think this is false. I think for that you need an S-3 filing. This is obviously above my paygrade and we need a securities lawyer to decipher this for us. What is noteworthy is that this simple news made **the stock move 10% and warrants move 25%.** So you see any small hints of positive news make this baby move massively.  \n\n**=================================================================================**\n\n**Notable Institutional Investors:**\n\nPERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.  200,000,100 $5,544,002,772\n\nGUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC    22,000,000 $499,180,000\n\nBAUPOST GROUP LLC     12,707,924 $352,264,000\n\nCITADEL ADVISORS LLC     2,167,041 $49,170,000\n\nPEAK6 INVESTMENTS LLC **(CALL)**    577,400 $16,006,000 **(New Position)**\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC    299,498 $8,302,000 **(New Position)**\n\nIt is speculated by redditors that the prominent wealthy investor that Bill Ackman was talking about is either Warren B, Bill G, or the Warlton family.

        "selftext": "eBay is going to roll on their earnings.\n\nBy roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n\n\nHere\u2019s some DD for anybody who doesn\u2019t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n\n\neBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That\u2019s just a given. \n\n\nI am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. \n\n\nLots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I\u2019m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn\u2019t why I\u2019m going fucking hard in the calls. Here\u2019s the real cherry on top:\n\neBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it\u2019s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n\n\nWell guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn\u2019t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. \n\nThis is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it\u2019s time we do the same.\n\n\nOh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok\u00e9mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It\u2019s 2021.\n\n\neBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a dumb and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I\u2019ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. \n\n\nTLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL",

In addition to owning nearly a third of the video game/social media/entertainment goliath, it also claims a board seat. Tencent has recently become involved in investing in startups of its own, and Prosus has direct access to sit in on those meetings, and get in on every potential deal on its own.\n\nAs of today, Tencent is worth just over $900B. At 31% ownership, this should give Prosus a valuation of $279B, off this one investment alone. And yet the company trades at a valuation under $200B. Prosus has specifically stated it has no intention of selling off its stake in Tencent, but it could do so and immediately have more cash on hand than its entire valuation. None of this even accounts for every other investment they have.\n\nManagement is acutely aware of the discrepancy between its valuation and actual AUM, and is working to get better correlation. It has approved a $5B stock buyback program, and is committed to taking further steps as necessary yo reach a proper valuation.\n\nIn short, Prosus is steeply discounted when you add up all of its total assets, and represents a fantastic buy opportunity. I've been in them since about fall of last year, and have been happy with CEO Bob Van Dijk's candid language and dedication to shareholders. Good luck to any potential investors.\n\nPosition: 1200 shares at $22.23",

If I was in the US I would put it all in ARK ETFs, because I really admire the investment strategy and obviously the ARK ETFs have done incredibly well recently. However, you can\u2019t invest in any ARK funds from the UK. My intention at the moment then is to build a portfolio based on the ARK ETF holdings, primarily from the genomics and next gen internet funds but not exclusively. My thinking behind this is that my own independent research is never going to match up to that of these guys (and other large institutions); I was thinking then of looking through the ark holdings for the different funds and spreading my investments across a number of their holdings, such as Exact Sciences, Shopify, PayPal,Teledoc etc etc. To me this seems like a pretty sound strategy but I have a couple of concerns:\n\n1. A lot of these ark holdings have had some really good runs recently, and so there\u2019s obviously the concern of buying at the top.\n2. Sufficient diversification\n\nIf anyone got any thoughts on this idea I\u2019d really like to hear them. Cheers.",

        "selftext": "Feb.15 is Presidents\u2019 Day and market is closed. With the second quarter of 2021 coming and policies of the new administration becoming clearer, I am looking to allocate my extra cash into a few sectors that I believe will have potentials but are either absent or underrepresented in my portfolio. I don\u2019t talk about popular sectors such as Fintech, online retail, renewable energy, IT and cloud computing, medical and healthcare, online streaming, electric cars e.t.c. simply because I already have picked my stocks and/or ETFs from these places.\n\n======\n\n1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, BNY, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN\n\nI welcome your thoughts and hope you all have a bullish and profitable 2021.",

        "selftext": "Contrast this with the recent news of PayPal shutting down its domestic operations in India.\n\nThis is an external source from Deutsch Bank, it is not Payoneer blowing its own horn. https://cib.db.com/insights-and-initiatives/flow/cash-management/prescient-on-payments.htm\n\nA key point that Payoneer is focusing on is \u201cworking capital\u201d. Essentially, it is money-lending to companies. Payoneer is focusing very hard on this. In fact, they have the Israel's former chief economist of the Ministry of Finance Yoel Naveh leading Payoneer\u2019s working capital division. Money-lending, as everyone knows, is very lucrative. \n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for people in India (or anyone in  the world) to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. \n($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)\nGiven all the recent news and growth, it is hard to imagine Payoneer cannot achieve that?\n\n\nSource (Deutsch Bank): https://cib.db.com/insights-and-initiatives/flow/cash-management/prescient-on-payments.htm\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country. Reports such as a 2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce and, according to Payoneer\u2019s 2020 Freelancer Income Report, work for an average hourly rate of INR1,282 \u2013 just over US$17, against a global average of US$21.\n\nIn August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India. It added that it was in talks with banks and non-bank financial companies to add working capital products to its payment services, although negotiations to gain the necessary regulatory authorisation have since been delayed by Covid-19.\n\nIndia is an FX-thirsty country which imports more than it exports,\u201d says Kulkarni. Indeed, OECD data for 2018 showed total exports at US$326bn and imports at US$492bn, an imbalance of US$166bn. \u201cIf you\u2019re an exporter and want to be compliant, you need to complete the documentation, but until recently it took months to complete a transaction. The banks also charged hefty fees that reflected the large amount of physical work involved and the rather chaotic process.\n\u201cDigitisation makes the job much easier \u2013 the documents can be downloaded, sent to the bank and the whole process completed within seconds, which helps merchants considerably.\u201d The achievement was recognised when Payoneer won in the Best Payments and Collections Solution category in The Asset\u2019s Treasury, Trade, SSC and Risk Management Awards 2020.\n\nDisclosure: Long FTOC common shares\n\nDisclaimer: Not a financial advisor",

        "selftext": "Hi, investor newbie here (6 mo.). I want to trim the amount of individual stocks that I own as I believe I overdiversified my money. I own some shares in both companies and they are the least performing in my portfolio. I would like to sell one as I could use the money on a better performing stock that I have gains in (QCLN/AMD/APPL).  For what it's worth, I have a little more money invested in Verizon, than I do Coca Cola. Can someone help me figure out what's the better stock to keep between KO and VZ? After doing some DD, this is what I came up with:\n\n\\_**The case for selling KO:\\_**\n\nCoca Cola: I got into this last stock July for $48.80 and it's currently at $49.92, so there's been zero growth. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q3-2020), they haven't been doing well either. Their revenue is down 10% from a year ago and their gross profit has decreased as well. KO's balance sheet shows that their total assets have went up, but so has their debt. They have increased their total debt by 15%, which has decreased the total equity value of the company. \n\nKO has also tripled the amount of money purchased in investments (according to their cash flow sheet), leading me to believe that they have no plans to recover immediately and are playing the long term game. \n\n**My** **Conclusion:** The only case for keeping KO currently is because of their dividends and name recognition. The pandemic has really affected KO and will probably not recover until it's over. With that being said, other stocks are booming so it would be foolish to leave money here to trade sideways until the COVID is over.\n\n\\_**The case for selling VZ:\\_**\n\nThis stock has actually been in a steep decline for several months, since hitting their ATH in early December. I'm currently in the negative in this stock, which is insane giving that the stock market set a new ATH records across the 3 major indexes. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q4-2020), their net income is down 9.6% (their revenue only increase 1% for the year). \n\nLike KO, VZ has also increased their amount of debt, but only by 8%. Their total equity is good, as it has increased by 10% from the year prior. Their cash flow sheet shows that they've spent a lot of money in investment activities, but this is offset by the net cash they gain in the last year (10+%). \n\n**My Conclusion:**  The case for if I should keep VZ is a conundrum for me. Their financials show growth, but the value of their stock declining sharply during a record level boom market. They have a at great dividend (4.5%) but it is not enough to cover their stocks loss in value. It is concerning and selling this stock would incur a slight loss for me. However I could regain it back quickly if I took the money wasted here and invest it into another stock (PayPal for example). \n\n**TLDR:** I own both KO and VZ. I would like to sell one of the stocks to chase gains in growth stocks, while keeping the other long term. Which one should I keep?",

        "selftext": "Hi Guys, \n\nI wanted to introduce you guys to Innovation Payment Solution ($IPSI). This is a fintech company based out of Southern California. Their primary product is a mobile payment system (IPSI Pay) used for money transfers. For instance on 2019 alone, IPSI kiosks processed 4.5 million transactions in Mexico. The company is now focusing on the United States. 50 kiosks are planned to be operating by Q2 2021 in Southern California. The company is also expanded on other fronts. They are about to roll out their very own \u201cIPSI coin\u201d - backed by the US dollar. But bigger news than that, is that they have moved into B2B and B2C ACH by starting the \u201cIPSI Payroll\u201d and \u201cIPSI Wallet\u201d platforms!\n\nIPSI is fully reporting to OTCQB. They have a share structure about one tenth the size of TSNP/HUMBL. There was a recent surge in price given the recent news.\n\nThe mobile payment sector is hot! PayPal, Paysafe, Payoneer, TSNP/HUMBL, FORW, etc. Obviously interest in IPSI is bruising now. This is still a great chance to get in cheap at 20 cents for an inevitable move to dollars IMO!\n\nRelevant links -\n\nhttps://www.investor.ipsipay.com\n\nhttps://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/IPSI\n\nAs always do your own DD and try to buy at the dip if interested.

        "selftext": "I updated the post below to reflect the current valuation and provide a context for evaluating FinTech companies. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor [presentation](https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/investor-presentation.pdf?_ga=2.142077554.1186770460.1612586492-2042252415.1612359068) and [webcast](https://viavid.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1426630&amp;tp_key=f7e0f9ea11). I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Payoneer (FTOC)**\n\n**Summary:** Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position.\n\nIMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available.\n\n**Company:** Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world).\n\n**Customers:** Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n**Industry and market opportunity:** B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300mn. Obviously, the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\n**Management team:** Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at Mastercard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see.\n\n**Business model:** Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and is expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed.\n\nWhile the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn\u2019t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I\u2019m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related.\n\nAs for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), its clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC's DD. My guess is they drilled down and liked what they saw.\n\nNote: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning.\n\n**Valuation:** FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.\n\nBased on FTOC's current share price of $13.50, Payoneer is currently trading at roughly $6bn, which assumes \\~430mn total shares outstanding.\\* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels.\n\n* The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's shares and the 30m share earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading 30% above NAV.\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\n**1.** **Majority of traffic stays within the network.** In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer.\n\n**2.** **Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends.** As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated.\n\n3. **Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate.** The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n4. **Playing the long game.** The company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Expect M&amp;A to figure into the company\u2019s strategic plans as well.\n\n**5.** **Attractive valuation:** Payoneer\u2019s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and \"adjusted\" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or \"expand\" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more \"a when rather than if\" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n1. **Competition:** PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don\u2019t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here.\n2. **Customer risk:** Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo).\n3. **Regulatory:** Payoneer needs to navigate every country\u2019s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V.\n4. **Crypto currency:** At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if its just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer.\n5. **FX exposure:** I\u2019m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure.\n\n**TLDR:** Payoneer is a proven company in a great space with a solid management team that is playing the long-game. IMHO, it could be a very attractive investment for LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am not a financial advisor.\n\nPositions:\n\n1. 1,000 FTOC common shares\n2. 10 February/December Covered Calls @ 12.50 (short) /17.50 (long). I intend to write monthly calls against the long option, which is known as a diagonal spread or poor man's covered call (PMCC).

Currently showing strength in premarket with high relative volume, I'll be keeping an eye on this one, but be patient and don't force trades. Resistance around 4.00 on the daily chart.\n2. CPSH: Gapping up on a seemingly pretty weak catalyst. Low float, so could see some volatile swings this morning. Be careful, and make sure to have an exit strategy if you choose to enter a trade. Premarket resistance around 9.80, with support at 8.85-8.90.\n3. AREC: Gapping up continuing momentum from yesterday's trading, no new catalyst. Low float so could see some volatile swings. Sometimes these day-2 plays die down early in the morning without providing trading opportunities, but it's worth keeping an eye on for a continuation play if price action and volume permit it. Premarket resistance at 4.63.\n4. ZYNE: Gapping up without a known catalyst. Seeing decent volume and price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance at around 4.40, with a potential gap to fill to a daily chart resistance of around 4.80. \n5. SNDL: Gapping up on momentum from previous days of trading, no new catalyst. Showing some strength in the premarket, with good price action. Extremely high float, so this could be a slow mover, but I'll be keeping an eye on it. \n6. SELB: Gapping up without a known catalyst. Good price action on okay volume in premarket. Showing some weakness now after if failed over premarket resistance, but I like it if it can get back up and cross that resistance at 5.74.\n7. CRBP: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday's trading. Seeing good price action and volume in the premarket. Premarket resistance around 3.14, with possible support around 2.50.\n8. CANF: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday's trading. Seeing good volume and decent price action in the premarket, with resistance around 2.55 and support at 2.10.\n\n**Large Cap Watchlist (over $10)**\n\n* Gapping UP: SLS, VCVC, ENLV, FUTU, CLNE, ZGNX, MJ, TLRY, APHA, GRWG, PYPL, CRSP, BEAM, MGNI, DKNG, PLTR, LAC, MARA, RIOT, GME\n* Gapping DOWN: SPOT, VXRT, X, HYLN, GSK, INO, CCIV, SQQQ, UVXY\n\nLots of stocks gapping up today, and good day for small caps in particular--lots of gap ups. We could see a push back to all-time-highs for SPY, but I expect to see some resistance. Silver up again today, and I'll be watching GME with popcorn once again. We've been seeing some little spikes in volatility, so things could potentially get choppy again. If it does happen to get choppy, use proper risk management and there is nothing wrong with sitting a day out. But until you see signs of choppiness, I'm expecting a relatively smooth start to the day. Selling cash secured puts is one of the strategies that I utilize, but I am currently being cautious regarding selling puts after we saw that recent correction.\n\nAlways remember proper risk management, and be a picky trader. Only you decide when you want to enter a trade, so don't force anything.

        "selftext": "  \n\nHi all,\n\nYesterday Enphase Energy published their Q4 2020 results. See my earlier DD here in this sub. \n\nWith this post I would like to discuss the results and the web-call with regard to future growth/earnings. So far my investment in Enphase was a solid move (5% after-market), let\u2019s hope that this momentum will increase. I have divided this post in three chapters: results, web-cast management notes and analyst Q&amp;A. However, before we continue let me first do a short into on the new C-suite hire. \n\n**Chief Marketing Officer**\n\nEnphase recently announced that they hired Allison Johnson as Chief Marketing Officer. Who is Mrs. Johnson and why did they hire her at this moment? Are sales declining or are there some amazing plans in the pipeline? \n\n\u201cJohnson brings decades of executive marketing experience to Enphase, including serving as chief marketing officer at PayPal, where she led a global marketing transformation, and as vice president of marketing communications at Apple, Inc., where she helped launch some of Apple\u2019s most iconic products and campaigns of the Steve Jobs era. Johnson received her Bachelor of Science degree in journalism and communications at the University of Florida.\u201d\n\nWhen checking her Linkedin, she started working at IBM as a Media Relations Director, moved to Netscape (1 year) \u00e0 HP (6 years) \u00e0 Apple (6 years) \u00e0 West (7 years) \u00e0 Paypal (1.5 years). \n\nLet leave it here for now. \n\n**Results Q4 2020:** \n\n\u00b7 We reported revenue of $264.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, along with 40.2% for non-GAAP gross margin. We shipped approximately 762 megawatts DC, or 2,292,132 microinverters.\n\n\u00b7 Revenue of $264.8 million \n\n\u00b7 Cash flow from operations of $84.2 million; ending cash balance of $679.4 million \n\n\u00b7 GAAP gross margin of 46.0%; non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2% \n\n\u00b7 GAAP operating income of $79.1 million; non-GAAP operating income of $72.4 million \n\n\u00b7 GAAP net income of $73.0 million; non-GAAP net income of $71.3 million\n\n\u00b7 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.51\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 8rqzlro7vmg61...*\n\nThis was their forecast for Q4 2020:\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, Enphase Energy estimates both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results as follows:\n\n\u00b7 Revenue to be within a range of $245.0 million to $260.0 million; revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments\n\n\u00b7 GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37.0% to 40.0%, excluding the recovery of the remaining $16.0 million tariff refund that has not yet been approved; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38.0% to 41.0%, excluding tariff refund and stock-based compensation expenses\n\n\u00b7 GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $51.0 million to $54.0 million, including $16.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization\n\n\u00b7 Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $35.0 million to $38.0 million, excluding $16.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization\n\nSo one can say that they performed extremely well. \n\n**Management notes web-call:**\n\n**Badri:** \n\n**\u201c**Let's now talk about manufacturing. Our operations team did a great job flexing manufacturing as 2020 played out. When the pandemic began, we cut manufacturing in Q2 of 2020 and then had to quickly ramp back up to meet the surge in demand in Q3 and Q4. The production in Q4 was more than two times the level in Q2. I'm very pleased with the ramp of our Mexico factory that met our target of producing more than 1 million units in Q4.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs part of our supply chain strategy to diversify production to tariff free and cost competitive locations globally, we began microinverter production at Salcomp, India in October of 2020 and started shipping to customers during Q4. We have a high quality state-of-the-art automated line with a quarterly production capacity of 0.5 million units and the space to add a second line with the same capacity. The production ramp is going very well and we expect to produce approximately 400,000 microinverters in India in Q1.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's now move on to the regions. Our US and international revenue mix for Q4 was 82% and 18%.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Europe, we reported record revenue for Q4. Revenue increased 10% sequentially. On an annual basis, the revenue from Europe increased 32% in 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Australia, we built on our strong Q3 results and achieved record quarterly sell-through and record installer count in Q4. The results were fueled by the launch of our Enphase Installer Network or EIN as well as growing demand for our high power IQ 7A microinverters plus a favorable competitive environment as regulations continued to shift towards safer and smarter solar. We expect to introduce our Enphase Storage system for the Australian market during the fourth quarter of 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Latin America, we reported record quarterly revenue. Puerto Rico showed strength for our microinverter systems as well as our storage systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the uptick in broad economic activity has stressed the global semiconductor supply chain. We are seeing constraints on a few semiconductor components used in our microinverters.\u201d \n\n**\u201c**There are two specific components that we are constrained on. One is our ASIC that goes into the micro and the other is the AC FET drivers that actually drive the high voltage FET. There the name of the game is we are qualifying multiple more sources so that we have more supply as well as expediting product. And I am in direct touch with the CEOs of those companies and they are helping as much as they can. We expect to get all caught up basically by early April. Our top priority through all of this is to ensure that we take care of customers. So we will do whatever it takes in order to ensure their lines are running and that they are not affected. So that's on the microinverter side.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou will see a lot more going forward. So we continue to grow at a nice clip. You can do the math. If we continue to grow at this 30%, soon we will need a third supplier, that might happen in 2022 and we are already talking to those people\u201d\n\n**TL:DR: They are growing in every aspect. They are trying to train installers internationally (Australia, Europe, South-America). Ones these installers are trained appropriately, they will start installing the products. Enphase will rather wait with the installment to only send very trained personnel, then just let a shitty installer do the job.** \n\n**Q&amp;A:**\n\n**Q1: \u201c**Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. So you said you'll start shipping IQ 8 in 2Q. How should we think about IQ 8's standalone pricing versus IQ 7? What may be the range on the premium and might you expect over time a majority of installers shifting more toward IQ 8 versus IQ 7 or is the jury out on that question still?\u201d\n\nA1: \u201cWith regarding whether people are going to adopt IQ 8 over IQ 7, we think the answer is a no brainer. It's going to be, yes. IQ 8 is a grid-independent microinverter system. So, therefore, I expect the adoption to be high when it is released and there are obviously a lot of combinations with IQ 8 and in some cases, people might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smarter storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.\u201d\n\nQ2: \u201cOkay. Thank you. And just on the R&amp;D cycle, are there any updates you can provide on the development of IQ 9 where that currently stands at this time? Is it still being developed or is it in testing phase? If you can provide any color there? Thank you.\u201d\n\nA2: \u201cYeah. We are actually working on IQ 9 at this time and IQ 9, our vision is basically obviously smaller, cheaper, faster, producing a lot more power than IQ 8. Right now, we are focused on a few areas. One is, we'd like to see how to reduce the footprint of the transformers, the \\[indiscernible\\] (00:49:10), the 600-volt AC FET devices through some semiconductor process innovation. GaN transistors are becoming widespread. GaN-on-GaN, GaN-on-silicon, they are becoming widespread.\u201d\n\nQ3: \u201cAnd just on the new acquisitions and the digital strategy, could you maybe talk about like what's the goal here in terms of reducing that soft cost? I think a couple in the solar developers have talked about $7,000 or $8,000 per customer of soft costs. So, is the idea here to kind of like bring it down similar to probably what the soft cost is in Europe and Australia or what's your thought process here? And I have just a quick follow-up after that as well. Thanks.**\u201d**\n\n**\u201c**Yeah. So, soft cost is an outcome of what our goal is. Our goal is to provide our installer partners with the best service possible, and so \u2013 installer partners actually as well as the homeowner. So, we have mapped out a very detailed journey of both how the entire installation process as well for both the installers as well as our homeowners starting with leads all the way through design, proposal, permitting, procurement, commissioning, installation commissioning, permission to operate O&amp;M, et cetera. And so, if we do an amazing job on that where we really create a very powerful platform and these acquisitions that we're talking about are important elements of that journey, then I think the natural outcome of that is going to be a reduction in the soft cost. But we are starting with a very clear focus that this is about bringing great value for our long-tail installer partners.\u201d\n\n**My thoughts:** \n\nStaying invested in a company post-earnings is normally not our strategy. We scan every company on the earnings calendar and dive in the fundamentals/growth of that company. If you find 3 solid companies which you want to gamble your money on per week, there is a possibility to earn 10% ROI on each of those companies. Investing in boomer company of which the stock increases 2% post-earnings is not interesting for us. It rather be +7% at least, or nothing. \n\nEnphase however is a different story. They keep beating their forecasts every quarter. There is enormous demand for their products and they a growing in supply and demand. \n\n\\- Management is amazing. The way Badri perceives the business is very client focused. They are well aware that this is a client focused business and quality and client experience are top priority. \n\n\\- With regards to future growth they have some very interesting things going on. IQ 8, which I expect to be finished during the 2nd quarter of this year. Then it is the job of the new CMO to promote the heck out of this. As Badri said in the call: \u201cpeople might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smarter storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.\u201d\n\n\\- There is so much growth opportunity in this company. And yes the P/E is high, but you must see Enphase as a tech company and not solar producer. Last quarter they hired 85 employees. \n\n\\- So our plan: keep this gem for one more quarter to see how their results are in the next quarter. Have they improved their semiconductors problem or not? Are they still beating the forecast or not. Then we\u2019ll see from there on. This weekend\u2019s plan: scan earnings calendar of next week to find the next gem \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n**Q1 2021 forecasts:** \n\nFor the first quarter of 2021, Enphase Energy estimates both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results as follows:\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be within a range of $280.0 million to $300.0 million; revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments\n\n\u2022 GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37.0% to 40.0%, as there are no remaining tariff refunds pending approval; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38.0% to 41.0%, excluding stock-based compensation expenses\n\n\u2022 GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $64.0 million to $67.0 million, including $22.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortization\n\n\u2022 Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $42.0 million to $45.0 million, excluding $22.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortization",

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this? When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers. For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well. The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.\n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit. When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of payment for your transaction. The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal?\n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above, Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments. To quote, PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues. It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

Everything you read is highly questionable and accuracy of information is not guaranteed. No financial advice here. I have a significant long position in PSTH. The merger target and date could be incorrect. I\u2019m talking up my book. This is not a research report, just speculation by a heroin addict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis: There is two parts to this speculation**\n\nA. PSTH will merge with Stripe. (For these see A-Exhibits)\n\nB. The announcement will come on Feb 17th. (For these see B-Exhibits)\n\n**What is Stripe?** A payment processing company that competes with Square and PayPal. In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company ra ised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $36 billion. It is currently being valued at $70 billion or more. Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. I\u2019m very familiar with the Irish, and the duo are extremely smart and have European way of thinking and mannerisms. \n\n**Background:** I presented the speculative evidence for Stripe being the target in A-Exhibits and timing in B-exhibits. A lot of these are scraped from various people who have done lots of digging. A speculative trade like this has high risk but also high reward. Nailing the timing on this would be tickets to retirement for some. So SPACs move massively on any news of discussion with a good target. Stripe is in my opinion as sweet honey. I highly doubt that Ackman and all those big investors like Guggenheim would invest in a SPAC without having a solid short list. I think their short list had Bloomberg and Stripe on it. They flirted with AirBnB and Coinbase just to see their chances. If any of those happened or a new sweet target emerged then they would do a quick second SPAC. They used PSTH to grab attention of other companies and see what they can attract for their future SPACs. Kind of like what Chamat did. I speculate that Stripe was their target and Stripe was just spending time getting ready for the Feb 17th announcement. All this is speculation. I also have read speculations about StarLink and Plaid and those really didn\u2019t hold any water. Collison brothers\u2019 way of running their companies has been very European like. Very cooperative and trusting of the process. They didn\u2019t mind giving a big chunk of their company to Y-combinator. They didn\u2019t mind hiring agitators. They just seem to operate like they live in Ireland and everyone is trustable. They are not used to dealing with NYC sharks. They are easy prey for a top predator like AckFuckingMan.  \n\n**Exhibit A-1: Stripe has been going on a hiring spree. 973 job postings vs last year 260** \n\n[https://stripe.com/jobs/search](https://stripe.com/jobs/search)\n\nBelow is how their site looks now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flnlxlslw9h61.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87db6dabc36405f78023b03d4bc034796b530c2f\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is how their postings looked in April of 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4i8x16pnw9h61.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=669af8e7fa5c787bf7d50335fbcf5d438fc95792\n\nHiring needs money!

This points at NDA and ongoing developments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cl4w71t4x9h61.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a7c4700a54a3ac65ad9d1fb506d1cf040831dbe\n\n**Exhibit A-10: Jackie Reses** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwnoow46x9h61.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c0eebb0de8cba03967d156e53fc2bf166e12002\n\nShe has been liking Stripe T-shirts and was invited to ClubHouse by a stripe member via some degrees of separation. Jackie was the head of capital for square and stepped down. She has also been liking tweets from Ackman. \n\n**Exhibit A-10: Peter Collison interacted with posts about SPAC on Twitter.** \n\nThose were on Jan 8th. They have been deleted since. I could be wrong about this exhibit.\n\n=====================================================================\n\n**Exhibit B-1: Bill Ackman earnings call:**\n\n[https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA\\~\\~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad](https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA~~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad)\n\nMin 42:30\n\n*\u201cIn terms of timing, what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us, we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter. Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won\u2019t meet our expected timeframe\u201d-* \n\n**Exhibit B-2: The two meetings are right one after another. Seems to be coordinated.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h61sx429x9h61.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15612de8d048b82be6287c5626e9c086601e0c54\n\n**Exhibit B-3: Note the bump in price and volume earlier this week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img raei4tsax9h61...*\n\nThis points to some insiders getting ready for the announcement. \n\n**Exhibit B-4: IV on the call options suggest big imminent news**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd58eumcx9h61.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93925ea255d0296de7b7b6f003af3846968d2993\n\nThis was captured before news of 13G filed on Friday. \n\n**Exhibit B-5: Twitter activity**\n\nOn Feb 8th Bill tweeted a Rap Song about SPACs: [https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096)\n\nBill is not too active on twitter, nor is John Collison.\n\nPatrick and John Collison both had a notable reduction in twitter activity in first week of Feb and all of a sudden they came alive on Feb 8th. This is the day that PSTH shares jumped \\~6% on no news. Insiders buying? There was a lot of unexplained excitement on that day both in twitter behaviour of parties involved and price of PSTH. \n\n**Exhibit B-6: 13G filing by PSH**\n\nNews of raising more money coming out just now! See 13G filled on **2/12/21** after hours. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm) \n\nI think there is a lot of confusion about this. People are saying that it is PSH increasing the PIPE, and this is pointing to a bigger deal. I think this is false. I think for that you need an S-3 filing. This is obviously above my paygrade and we need a securities lawyer to decipher this for us. What is noteworthy is that this simple news made **the stock move 10% and warrants move 25%.** So you see any small hints of positive news make this baby move massively.  \n\n**=================================================================================**\n\n**Notable Institutional Investors:**\n\nPERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.  200,000,100 $5,544,002,772\n\nGUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC    22,000,000 $499,180,000\n\nBAUPOST GROUP LLC     12,707,924 $352,264,000\n\nCITADEL ADVISORS LLC     2,167,041 $49,170,000\n\nPEAK6 INVESTMENTS LLC **(CALL)**    577,400 $16,006,000 **(New Position)**\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC    299,498 $8,302,000 **(New Position)**\n\nIt is speculated by redditors that the prominent wealthy investor that Bill Ackman was talking about is either Warren B, Bill G, or the Warlton family. I think this doesn\u2019t matter since there is enough institutional and big money interest in this that money is not an issue. A celebrity name like Bill Gates or Warren B would be nice.",

Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot.

        "selftext": "So most of the stocks posted that people like for the long term have some insane floats, about 1 billion+ and sure some have market caps that are low, usually 200-300m or less but even with low market caps I can't see a stock price rising higher than $1-$3 (this assumes ofc that the company is very very good for the future and truly can change things) because of the shares outstanding or am I wrong?\n\nNow TSNP kind of doesn't match up with what I said about in that it went from pennyland to dollar land even though it has 5b market cap and 3.9b shares outstanding but lets say a company like TSNP (ignore the HUMBL ticker change for a sec) if they were to stay the same company how much higher than $1 can they get with a 5b market cap and 3.9b shares outstanding? The only way I would see it going insane price is if they do something game changing which personally after ticker change I see them changing the game when compared to paypal so for this example I would say it def has potential to go much much higher than $1 if they execute correctly but assuming it was an ordinary company how much higher could it get with a market cap and shares outstanding that large?\n\nSome other examples is OZSC (1b cap, 3b shares outstanding) SNPW (139m, 966m shares outstanding), INND (215m cap, 3b shares outstanding).\n\nEach of those companies need to literally be game changers in order to get past $1 no? Like when I look at the Apples, Teslas, Amazons, and Microsofts of the world and other big time blue chip companies most have 1B shares outstanding or less but those companies are like literally game changer\n\nSome of these OTC stocks already have shares outstanding 1B+ and they are nowhere near the level of those blue chip stocks, so if these OTC stocks to have insane share prices they would need market caps that are just as big if not more than blue chip stocks so really my main goal behind this post is to try to find some sort of exit strategy for these \"long hold OTC\" stocks.  \n\nFinal summary: In my opinion, since OTC stocks have super high caps and shares, if they are truly a long term hold they should be able to reach $1 even with those high caps/shares BUT to get past $1 and get to $10 $50 $100+ is near impossible unless they completely change the game like the blue chips mentioned above, therefore, isn't it smart to pull out of these pennystocks once they reach dollar land because the odds of them \"changing the game\" is prob super low. \n\nWhats your thoughts? I understand most people trade pennystocks for a day or less, while others like to play the long term and wait for all PRs/catalysts before deciding what to do, for the people who like long term pennystocks do you plan to hold after dollar land and if so how high you think these insanely high caps/shares can go?\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.\n\n&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday\u2019s close of $325. In last week\u2019s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday\u2019s premarket.\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week\u2019s 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June\n\n&gt; * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He\u2019ll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a \u201ctransition period to be determined by the board.\u201d Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck\u2019s chief executive since January 2011.\n\n&gt; * Frazier\u2019s retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car\n\n&gt; * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday\u2019s premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called \u201cApple Car,\u201d which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech\n\n&gt; * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Biden signals flexibility on Covid stimulus\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers to \u201cact fast\u201d on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan but also signaled flexibility.

        "selftext": "https://m.imgur.com/gallery/4ihSh22\n\n# Strategy\n&gt;...That was the unseen message. I mean, nobody ever said it that way. So, I have seen half of the United States\u2019 talent basically put off to the side. - Warren Buffet\n\nI find that the most valuable investing tool is to pay attention to the obvious and to keep investments simple to understand. I expect a few things to happen throughout the years as I invest, and I try to be sensible about those changes. Time is on my side.\n\n- Industrial processes will improve greatly by way of automation technology.\n- Research into materials improve, in order to solve significant challenges related to global climate &amp; health.\n- US women and minorities education rates will cause dramatic changes in economic opportunity.\n- Financial regulations will lower to adjust for the level of trust that cybersecurity applications bring to its system.\n- Trade between the US &amp; Mexico will increase.\n- Cloud computing will serve as a bridge for many economic frontiers.\n\nAs the saying goes, invest in what you know. So let\u2019s get on with it, technology and industrials.\n\nMy strategy is to build an engine that I can debate about and get behind the wheel on. It can change over time, but it\u2019s the critical thought process that matters at the end. It\u2019s an engine that I want to trust to run through the good times and bad so that I am not nearly as concerned with current financial statuses at certain periods of time.\n \n## Cash (15-30%)\n\nThe most critical element to my portfolio is a constant rate of cash per month. This is a \u201cjoker card\u201d, if you will, where eventually the growing cash pile will eventually be invested when the opportunity is right and resets to 0. This holding is reserved for highly desired investment opportunities like:\n\n- Impossible Foods\n- MOD Pizza\n- Reddit\n- RH (don\u2019t hurt me)\n\nIt is a pile of cash that searches for a wonderful company at a fair price. \n\n## Industrial (20-35%)\n\nThis element to my portfolio helps me sleep at night. The goal here is to try to capture important elements to a healthier North American industrial sector. The name of the game is **quality** and to capture broader markets. \n\nAt the speculative level, the economic consequences of industrial automation should start to gain more impact. One could argue that the value of precision measurement will increase as machines handle more material, for example.\n\n1. AMD - _Computing_\n2. Mettler-Toledo - _Precision Scales &amp; Analytic Instruments_\n3. Ecolab - _Sanitation, water, energy, and air management_\n4. Kansas City Southern - _Mexican-American Trade_\n5. Rockwell Automation - _Industrial controls_\n\n  \n## Cloud Compute (45-60%)\n\nThese are my general bets on technology. I found it enormously challenging to go through the exercise of selecting a stock between industry leaders like Square &amp; PayPal or Alphabet &amp; Apple.\n\nI\u2019ve included where these companies are consequential, and why they will sustain growth as a result.\n\n1. Pinterest - _Discovery Engine (Women driven markets)_\n2. Square - _Financial Access (Underbanking solutions)_\n3. Alphabet - _Internet (Distribution of education technology)_\n4. Fastly - _Networking (Serverless compute)_\n\n  \n## ETFS and Watchlist (10-20%)\n\nThese holdings are held in order to track certain industry \u201cbets\u201d like robotics, electric grids, cyber security, gaming, semiconductors and the like. The point is to diversify almost excessively here and to observe changes over time.\n\n- FTXL First Trust US Semiconductor\n- CIBR First Trust Cybersecurity\n- GRID First Trust Smartgrid Infrastructure\n\n- ARKQ Ark Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics\n- ARKG Ark Genomic Revolution\n- ARKF Ark Fintech Innovation\n\n- ICLN iShares Global Clean Energy\n- EWW iShares Mexico\n- SOXX iShares US Semiconductor\n- IYM iShares Basic Materials\n\n- Berkshire\n- Tesla\n- Sherwin Williams\n- James Hardie PLC\n- AirBnB\n- Elastic",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Last week, I bought 2X Pypl Bull Put Spreads 270/260 9.06/5.86 credit of $320/each. Yesterday, I wanted to buy a third spread of 280/270 8.45/5.45 for another credit of $300. E-Trade was acting weird so I ended up using Power E-Trade to buy the third spread but instead of opening a new sell/buy put position, it opened a new sell and closed one of my prior 270 from last week. I understand that it is probably net/net at the time of purchase but now my account shows a spread for 280/260 with a cost of 8.45/5.86 which seem really unfavorable vs my prior position. Am I looking at this wrong? Did I realize $300 for the 280/270 trade and now have a potential to earn 8.45 - 5.86 = $259 in additional premium?",

But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, BNY, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. \n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit. \n\nThoughts?",

Online shopping is expected to stay at the current elevated levels** because it is more convenient (easier and saves time).\n\n2.Retailers are rapidly adapting to this new landscape and accelerating the pace of digitisation by 3-5 years.\n\nThe strong launch of PYPL's service is another data point which suggests BNPL demand in the US is very strong.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, February 4, 2021**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending this week\u2019s remarkable rally further. The market\u2019s quick recovery is encouraging given last week was the market\u2019s worst since October. Market participants largely shook off concerns over heightened volatility following last week\u2019s historic, Reddit-fueled rally in stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC and turned their attention back to corporate earnings reports and positive news on the vaccine and stimulus fronts coming out of Washington. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.12% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.18% up, and the Dow (DIA) closed 1.10% up.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate voted to move forward with a process to fast track approval of President Biden\u2019s new coronavirus stimulus package. The Senate opened debates on budget resolutions for the fiscal year of 2021, with the intention of including parts of Biden\u2019s stimulus package with a simple majority.  In Congress, budget resolutions only need a simply 50+1 majority rather than the 60-vote supermajority required to pass major bills. In this manner, Democrats would be able to pass the stimulus without Republican support. The House of Representatives is expected to adopt a similar move soon. \"With this budget resolution, the Democratic Congress is paving the way for the landmark Biden-Harris coronavirus package that will crush the virus and deliver real relief to families and communities in need,\" Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement. As a reminder, in the Senate, there remains a 50/50 split between Democrats and Republicans, but Kamala Harris, as the Vice President, has the power to cast a tie-breaking vote if need be.\n\nToday, the White House announced a plan to ship coronavirus vaccines directly to retail pharmacies like CVS in an effort to boost the pace of vaccinations. The move is expected to raise the [weekly supply of shots by 1 million to 11.5 million.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-increased-vaccine-supply-initial-launch-of-the-federal-retail-pharmacy-program-and-expansion-of-fema-reimbursement-to-states/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Some notable earnings after the bell are: Snap (SNAP), Gilead (GILD), Pinterest (PINS) and Peloton (PTON) after market close.\n* Weekly Unemployment claims came in at 779,000, below the 830,000 estimate.\n* Ford (F) said it will cut its output of F-150 pickups due to a shortage in the semiconductors needed.\n* Gamestop (GME) and other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d continue to be under heavy pressure. Gamestop pulled back another 42% today, with the stock around $53 at the time of writing.\n* Apple (AAPL) is close to a deal with Hyundai-Kia to make an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at a Kia plant in Georgia, CNBC reported late Wednesday, citing \u201cmultiple\u201d sources who briefed CNBC on the plan.

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Nokia Corporation \n\nFinancial Statement Release\n4 February 2021 at 08:00 (CET +1)\n\n \n\nNokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and Full Year 2020\n\nSolid margin performance driven by customer demand in North America\n\n \n\n5% year-on-year decrease in reported net sales in Q4, primarily due to Mobile Access, as declines in network deployment and planning services were partially offset by growth in radio access products\n1% growth in constant currency net sales in Q4\nContinued improvements in our Mobile Access portfolio; strengthening roadmaps, reducing product costs and improving product performance; commitment to invest in R&amp;D to drive product leadership\nIncrease in Mobile Access gross margin in Q4, primarily driven by improved 5G gross margin, partially offset by a project-related loss provision\nPositive operating profit, on a reported basis, in Q4 and full year 2020\nNon-IFRS operating profit in Q4 benefited by approximately EUR 250 million, due to the timing of revenue recognition and a net positive fluctuation in Nokia\u2019s venture fund investments\nStrong free cash flow in Q4 and full year 2020 benefited from an early customer payment of approximately EUR 0.5 billion, which was expected in Q1 2021\nDerecognized EUR 2.9 billion of Finnish deferred tax assets, which are not lost\nReiterated outlook for 2021 comparable operating margin of 7-10% and provided new outlook for net sales and free cash flow\nBoard does not propose a dividend or dividend authorization for the financial year 2020\n \n\nThis is a summary of the Nokia Corporation financial report for Q4 and full year 2020 published today. The complete financial report for Q4 and full year 2020 with tables is available at www.nokia.com/financials. Investors should not rely on summaries of our financial reports only, but should review the complete financial reports with tables.\n\n \n\nPEKKA LUNDMARK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ON Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2020 RESULTS\n\n\nNokia delivered a solid Q4 to end 2020 at the high end of our Outlook range. We saw healthy gross margin and operating margin performance for both Q4 and full year 2020, supported by a regional mix shift towards the higher margin North America region and by our ongoing R&amp;D efforts to enhance product quality and cost competitiveness.\n\nFrom a business group perspective, in Q4 and full year 2020, our gross margin improvement was primarily driven by Networks, as was our full year operating margin performance. In Q4, our operating profit performance benefited by approximately EUR 250 million from two unexpected, yet significant drivers: a timing benefit of approximately EUR 150 million as we recognized net sales at the very end of the quarter, which we had expected in 2021; and we had a net positive fluctuation in Nokia\u2019s venture fund investments of approximately EUR 100 million.\n\nThe healthy close to the year does not change our earlier communicated view for Nokia-level operating margin expected in 2021.\n\nNet sales for Q4 were down 5% on a reported basis and up 1% in constant currency and for full year 2020 they were down 6% on a reported basis and down 4% in constant currency.\n\nNokia delivered strong cash performance in Q4 and full year 2020, benefitting from a large customer payment that had been expected in Q1 2021, marking the third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Additionally, our liquidity position continues to be solid.\n\nFinancial improvement in Mobile Access was clear in both Q4 and full year 2020 results, reflecting our ongoing efforts to strengthen the competitiveness and cost position of our mobile radio products. Overall, we saw growth in radio access products in Q4 and full year 2020, with growth in 5G partially offset by decreases in legacy radio access products.\n\n5G gross margin increased due to product cost reduction, partly helped by higher ReefShark shipment volumes. Our aim was to be above 35% for our KPI on shipments of our \u201c5G Powered by ReefShark\u201d portfolio; we ended the year at 43% and we remain on track to realize 70% by the end of 2021. This underlines the ongoing progress with our Mobile Networks turnaround and, as I said in Q3, we will invest whatever it takes to win in 5G.  Completing the turnaround in Mobile Networks remains our top priority for 2021, and these visible signs of progress give me confidence that we are on the right track but there is still work to be done.\n\nOur Enterprise business delivered another good set of results giving a solid foundation to build on. Q4 Enterprise net sales were up 1% in reported and 5% in constant currency. For full year 2020, they were up 11% in reported and 14% in constant currency, reflecting our leadership position in many areas, including in private wireless. We announced key partnerships with AT&amp;T and Verizon for private wireless and won 79 new customers in Q4. We now have 260 private wireless customers. Public sector demand remains robust and we announced a US federal government cyber deal after the quarter end in mid-January.\n\nAt the end of 2020, we announced a new operating model to better align us with the needs of our customers and to better maintain and achieve technology leadership in the areas where we choose to compete.\n\nPleasingly we already have strong technology leadership positions in many key areas of our new business groups.  In Network Infrastructure we have industry-leading FP4-based products and in Cloud and Network Services we are jointly developing transformational cloud-native 5G core solutions for CSPs and Enterprise customers. In our Mobile Networks business, together with Elisa and Qualcomm, we hold the worldwide 5G speed record.\n\nThese are encouraging results, however, as I said in Q3, we expect 2021 to be challenging, a year of transition, with meaningful headwinds due to market share loss and price erosion in North America.\n\nAdditionally, as I said, delivering on our new operating model for a strong and sustainable long-term business requires us to make further 5G R&amp;D investments in 2021, meaning we will sacrifice some short-term margin to ensure leadership in 5G.\n\nConsidering these elements, we maintain our comparable operating margin outlook for 2021 and \u2013 as new items \u2013 give an outlook for net sales and free cash flow for 2021. As previously stated, we intend to provide a long-term outlook latest at Capital Markets Day on March 18.\n\nRegarding dividend, we are pleased with Nokia\u2019s recent operational performance and satisfied that we have strengthened our cash position. However, with the focus on increased investments in 5G and strategic areas, while continuing to establish a track record of sustainable cash generation, the Board does not propose a dividend or dividend authorization for the financial year 2020. We intend to provide an update on our dividend policy latest at Capital Markets Day.\n\nWe took important steps in 2020 to accelerate roadmaps, improve execution and create a new way of working, which will enable Nokia to return to a sustainable long-term financial performance. We know we have our work cut out for us in 2021, but the new Group Leadership Team has hit the ground running. As announced earlier, we will go deep into each of our business groups at our Capital Markets Day to discuss specific targets and action plans.\n\nI want to conclude by thanking everyone at Nokia. This has been a year of incredible change where our personal resilience as well as technology has been tested like never before. I am extremely proud of our team, their commitment and their achievements. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.\n\n&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday\u2019s close of $325. In last week\u2019s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday\u2019s premarket.\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week\u2019s 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June\n\n&gt; * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He\u2019ll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a \u201ctransition period to be determined by the board.\u201d Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck\u2019s chief executive since January 2011.\n\n&gt; * Frazier\u2019s retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car\n\n&gt; * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday\u2019s premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called \u201cApple Car,\u201d which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech\n\n&gt; * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5.

Biden told lawmakers in private comments Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cnot married\u201d to an absolute number for the overall bill but wants them to \u201cgo big\u201d on pandemic relief and \u201crestore the soul of the country.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/7HyJrkD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4D1ZzFL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/xv1RdWa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/I3EtDfQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/oDg1a06.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kyPHRhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrLePbl.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qHQpeLy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XvyTr2i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7qIfxls.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ygir5N.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jOyOkJG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WnzRtqa.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ouXy3Xv.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gBzCmaO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/f8ItHFz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/SS9oUVD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-canada-goose-ebay-paypal-qualcomm-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Canada Goose (GOOS)** \u2013 Canada Goose shares surged more than 15% in the premarket after the outerwear maker beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, February 3, 2021**\n\nStocks continued pushing higher Wednesday as market participants continued to digest corporate earring results and increasingly more positive data on coronavirus cases, the pace of vaccinations, and stimulus discussions in Washington. Alongside the rally, stocks that are favored by social media users continued under pressure as the battle between short-sellers and retail traders continues.\n\nShares of mega-cap stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) continued advancing on the backs of positive corporate earnings results. After reporting the company\u2019s first $100 billion revenue quarter, Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos announced he was stepping down from his role as CEO saying, \u201cI\u2019m excited to announce that this Q3 I\u2019ll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.\u201d Amazon Web Services CEO Andrew Jassy will take over as CEO. Shares of Amazon dropped around 2% today despite the positive earnings, but we suspect the shares will climb right back up. Shares of Alphabet gapped up 7% today on the back of their earnings report.\n\nMeanwhile, discussions for additional fiscal stimulus carried on in Washington, D.C. On Tuesday, the Democratically-controlled Senate narrowly voted to open debate for a budget resolution for the 2021 fiscal year, with an eye toward advancing additional coronavirus relief aid with a simple majority instead of the 60 votes needed for most legislation in the chamber. In Congress, budget resolutions only need a simply 50+1 majority rather than the 60-vote supermajority required to pass major bills. \n\nToday, the White House announced a plan to ship coronavirus vaccines directly to retail pharmacies like CVS in an effort to boost the pace of vaccinations. The move is expected to raise the [weekly supply of shots by 1 million to 11.5 million.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-increased-vaccine-supply-initial-launch-of-the-federal-retail-pharmacy-program-and-expansion-of-fema-reimbursement-to-states/)\n\nWe are happy to report that after hitting record-highs in coronavirus infections, deaths, and hospitalizations, the numbers have steadily declined in the past weeks. After a record-high of 300,000 infections on January 8, the US reported around 111,000 cases on Sunday, the lowest number since early November, according to Johns Hopkins University. Fingers crossed the trend can be maintained as the pace of vaccinations increases.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* On Wednesday, companies including Qualcomm (QCOM), eBay (EBAY), PayPal (PYPL) and GrubHub (GRUB) are scheduled to report quarterly results after market close.\n* After announcing that the new Tesla (TSLA) Model S and X would have a gaming system built into the car, reports are surfacing that AMD may be supplying the chips [https://www.benzinga.com/tech/21/02/19473529/tesla-may-be-using-amd-gpu-in-new-model-s-x-for-gaming](https://www.benzinga.com/tech/21/02/19473529/tesla-may-be-using-amd-gpu-in-new-model-s-x-for-gaming)\n* Despite recent volatility and worries of an anti-monopoly crackdown by the Chinese government, Alibaba (BABA) climbed around 3.5% today after reporting positive earnings\n* Amgen (AMGN) target raised by Cantor  Fitzgerald from $280 to $295. Stock currently around $234\n* After posting its first every $100b quarter, Amazon (AMZN) received a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $4,250 at Buy. Stock currently around $3373\n* After posting positive earnings, Alibaba (BABA) with 3 target raises. Stock currently around $266\n   * Raymond James PT at $350\n   * HSBC PT at $330\n   * Macquarie at $395\n* Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) with a host of target raises. Stock currently around $1476. Consensus price target at $1750 at Outperform\n* Catalent (CTLT) with two target raises. Stock currently around $116\n   * Morgan Stanley from $115 to $135 \n   * Royal Bank of Canada from $125 to $137\n* Cedar Fair (FUN) target raised by B. Riley from $49 to $57 at Buy. Stock currently around $43\n* After positive earnings, Alphabet (GOOG) with a host of  target upgrades. Stock currently around $2047. Consensus price target of $2,400 at Overweight. \n* Ichor (ICHR) with two target raises. Stock currently around $40\n   * Deutsche Bank from $42 to $50\n   * Needham &amp; Co. from $44 to $46\n* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) with a host of target raises. Stock currently around $177. Consensus price target around $220 at Buy.\n* Qualcomm (QCOM) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $155 to $175 at Buy. Stock currently around $163\n* Twilio (TWLO) target raised by Keycorp from $350 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $384\n* UPS with two target raises. Stock currently around $157\n   * Wells Fargo from $184 to $193 at Overweight\n   * Credit Suisse from $202 to $205 at Overweight\n\n\u201cLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. \u2015 **S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard**",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.\n\n&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday\u2019s close of $325. In last week\u2019s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday\u2019s premarket.\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week\u2019s 847,000.

Greenland at #5. Greenland is at #1 in Vudu and Fandango Now. No 8 in Apple Itunes,no 10 at Google Play. Both are doing extraordinary businesses. Give us some updated numbers damn!!!!!!\n\nGreenland is in number 1 position in Vudu's top Paid Video On Demand after 6 weeks also. Total ratings in Vudu crossed 41K.\n\nHigh February call volume indicating a probable move north of $2.50 in the next couple of weeks.\n\nNetflix worth 1000.00 per sub and we are currently at 30.00.

Low risk, high reward at current price. Highly manipulated to ride through and add on dips. About leaker (Bax28 Post), 1. Jareeddi has 7M shares with 2/3 of those pre STX merger - we all knew this 2. His listed SP is 2.68 avg 3. Presentation was to potential/current investors in his firm 4. He has an obligation to explain the firms high position in ESGC given it is currently a losing position despite a record bull market 5. He has had Hollywood connections for years - married to B list actress. In leaked video at 30:34 in video Jeereddi estimates $4-6 per share in 12-18 months, $6-8 in 2 years, and $10-15 in 3+ yrs. (Sid1988 post) summary from the Jerradi leak: 1. Management is probably in restricted period to buy more shares as per Bob to Naveen. 2. Still 40mn options as per incentive is going to add or in process to various board members as the part of merger and hence intentional price suppression. 3. 40mn subscribers (probably) by now and targeting 50mn paid subscribers by 2022 end 4. Possible 50-100mn content deal between Apple and Eros (just a hint, speculative) 5. Net debt will be 325mn usd by end of 2021 March. Indian debt will be transferred to US credit facility. 6. STX will release 8 films a year. Total 5 scripted and 6 non scripted series are in production with collaboration with Amazon, Netflix, HBO. At 42:25 Naveen was smiling to say Apple has lot of incentive if they want to acquire Eros and enter to the Indian market... this guy has almost 6% stake on our company and knows everything.\n\nAs previously announced, the Company intends to issue, pending Board approval, an additional 40 million A ordinary shares in management plan equity awards. - Slight increase in outstanding shares expected.\n\nSID1988 Post - Greenland total revenue breakdown: 100mn USD. Worldwide box office: $50-51mn PVOD box office: $13-15mn HBO deal: $25mn Amazon deal: $6-9mn Total: 100mn Budget: $35mn Profit: Over $30mn Blockbuster.\n\nSid1988 post - 40mn shares will be added in form of options packages to the board as incentives. Probably already started. And that will probably be done in money that means they will immediately sell to market. Which is what probably we are seeing the large DP shorting and those block trades. So basically it is in semi-dilution phase (already know infor on the 40mn option package). After that is cleared they will start pumping it out with all the news and investor day.\n\nInvestor day will be sometime in Q1 of 2021\n\nLast Wed, Thur and Fri was the biggest volume days we've seen since merger.\n\nCompany over $250 million revenue, targeting over 1 billion by 2023.\n\nAround 20 percent of this stock is shorted right now.\n\nProfile: Eros STX Global Corporation, (\u201cErosSTX\u201d or \u201cThe Company\u201d) (NYSE: ESGC) is a global entertainment company that acquires, co-produces and distributes films, digital content &amp; music across multiple formats such as theatrical, television and OTT digital media streaming to consumers around the world. Eros International Plc changed its name to Eros STX Global Corporation pursuant to the July 2020 merger with STX Entertainment, merging two international media and entertainment groups. The combination of one of the largest Indian OTT players and premier studio with one of Hollywood\u2019s fastest-growing independent media companies has created an entertainment powerhouse with a presence in over 150 countries. ErosSTX delivers star-driven premium feature film and episodic content across a multitude of platforms at the intersection of the world\u2019s most dynamic and fastest-growing global markets, including US, India, Middle East, Asia and China. The Company also owns the rapidly growing OTT platform Eros Now which has rights to over 12,000 films across Hindi and regional languages and had 211.5 million registered users and 36.2 million paying subscribers as of September 30th, 2020.\n\nYahoo News since last filing: \n\n1. December 11th, Eros Now Announces its Biggest Content Slate\n2. 20 Days Ago, Hosted Abu Dhabi T10 tournament, now official team sponsor of Team Abu Dhabi\n3. Eros Now Select available through Apple TV in 11 new Countries\n4. Horizon Line premiering on EPIX\n5. Reached 36.2 Million Subs (2 months ago)\n\nPotential Catalysts: Subscription growth and revenue per sub. PVOD results. New film releases. PR and ER from management.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this Rocket Worthy? The first post I saw on reddit was bashed heavily, mention toxic financing (which I cannot find) from merger of two companies a year ago. Seems there are a few bitter people who lost money or are bagholders. \n\nCrossposting to a few sites I belong to. Will update on any major findings...",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

Have Fun.\n\nEDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data\n\nEDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",

        "selftext": "Long time trader, first time poster, lol. Went on a bit of an options spree today. Would love to get your feedback:\n\n* **$FVRR** bought Feb 19 '21 210c at $20.86 - this is my strongest conviction trade and largest option position right now. Had previously sold Feb and Mar 200p and 210p. *Finally* started turning around today.\n* **$AMTX** bought Feb 19 '21 10c for $0.94 - closed at $1.05\n* **$EHTH** bought Mar 19 '21 85c for $1.30 - closed down at 0.90 and Feb 19 '21 65c for 1.10 also closed down at 0.90 but this should rebound in short order.\n* **$AMC** closed out most of my remaining Feb and Mar 15c and 3.5c respectively for around 1,000% on a small position.\n* **$BCRX** rolled a prior position into Mar 19 '21 10c for 2.53 (closed at 3.30), June '21 12c for 2.88 (closed at 3.45), and Sep '21 16c for 2.55 (closed at 3.00).\n* **$IRTC** added more to a position I began last week when the stock unexpectedly dropped 40% on medicare reimbursement rates that the company states strongly is merely an administrative error. So far it seems analysts are in general agreement, though some are holding their breath. Today I bought Mar '21 220c for 25.06 (closed at 30.60)\n* **$RIOT** believing that $BTC has about bottomed and will be comin' round the mountain soon, I bought some shares and Feb 05 '21 17c for 3.07 (closed at 3.55). Later in the day I added Feb 05 '21 16c for 4.20 (closed at 4.35) and 20.5c for 1.46 (closed at 1.35)\n* **$UNIT** discovering it as a high conviction trade from Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame--and he was pretty right about $GME in a big way, was he not?--I bought a spread of Aug '21 15c for 1.00 (closed at 0.85) and Jan '22 15c at 1.55 (closed at 1.35) and Jan '22 20c for 0.65 (closed at 0.45).\n* **$NNOX** bought May '21 70c at 17.00 (closed at 17.50) and Aug '21 90c at 17.56 (closed at 30.50 - nice!)\n* **$FUBO** bought Apr '21 50c at 16.05 (closed at 17.30). This was an add to a prior stock and option position.\n* **$RDFN** added to my position here as well. Bought May '21 80c at 9.26 (closed at 9.70) and Aug '21 90c at 9.46 (closed at 10.00).\n* **$PCG** based on some unusual call option activity I noticed, I sold some Mar '21 11p and bought several different calls: Mar '21 12c, 14c; and Jun '21 13c, 15, and 17c. Probably spent too much on commissions here. Whatev. I'm learning the best strategies not just through learning and reviewing theory but also by experimenting with actual trades.\n* **$GME** \\- and this was my revenge trade. I lost a lot of money on this last week, buying shares on the way up then getting stopped out when IBKR halted my ability to do anything but close out. And close out I did at nearly 50% losses. Plus my whole portfolio suffered as brokers, funds and everyone else was liquidating to cover their shorts. In any case, I did a safe trade and a risky trade:\n\n1. Safe: sold Jan '22 25p for 10.00 and 10p for 2.55. Being so far out they haven't moved.. yet.\n2. Risky: bought Feb 05 '21 220p for 53.61 (closed at 52.00) and 190p for 38.59 (closed at 36.20).\n\nOther holdings (some stock, some options, some both):\n\n$TSLA $FVRR $FLGT $ARKK $ARKQ $ARKG $ARKW $SNDL $SOXL $SWKS $EXPI $VXRT $AMZN $PRNT $REGI $ETHE $IPO $LABU $AXON $NERD $TAN $SI $TTGT $SPCX $IPOF $QCLN $NOW $MGNI $SAVA $PENN $WKHS $PBW $SCYX $EDC $WPRT $BUG $ALT\n\nOpen to feedback, questions, your thoughts and insights. Trying to give back for all I've learned here and elsewhere. Cheers!",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

        "selftext": "Hey all, I'm very new to trading, had always  wanted to dive in but never really have the disposable income to do so.  \n\n\nI know it can be a risky move, especially for those who don't really have money to play with. But with apps like Robinhood making it a bit simpler to get into the game and buy/sell etc. I figured I'd finally try my luck.  \n\n\nNow I know there's some out there that can drop a few thousand into the market like it's nothing and move from there. However I'm not in that boat and so taking risky chances with what I do have to throw in on a chance that something will jump up is a harder decision for someone like me. At my current rate I figure I can throw in about $50 a week or so, and sometimes more depending on the money I have coming in.  \n\n\nI was wondering what some might think of the decisions I made, based on me assuming the companies I bought into being more 'safe bets' compared to some other options. The stocks I had bought, along with how much I put in (It will be added to and adjusted more evenly over time) are as follows:  \n\n\n**Skyworks (SWKS) - $5**  \n**Intel (INTC) - $5**  \n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $5**  \n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $5**  \n**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) - $30**  \n\n\nNvidia is the one I was most unsure on after buying it, but with what seems like everyone buying GPUs these days, along with a mining surge again, I figured it'd be an okay pick. Not necessarily looking for advice or any of that in the sense of making a bad investment based off of something someone may suggest. Just the thoughts on my choices and possibly adding more to these in the future.  \n\n\nOther options I had considered were Amazon, Apple, and Google. But was unsure on how they would react as the pandemic begins to disappear eventually.",

Had previously sold Feb and Mar 200p and 210p. *Finally* started turning around today.\n* **$AMTX** bought Feb 19 '21 10c for $0.94 - closed at $1.05\n* **$EHTH** bought Mar 19 '21 85c for $1.30 - closed down at 0.90 and Feb 19 '21 65c for 1.10 also closed down at 0.90 but this should rebound in short order.\n* **$AMC** closed out most of my remaining Feb and Mar 15c and 3.5c respectively for around 1,000% on a small position.\n* **$BCRX** rolled a prior position into Mar 19 '21 10c for 2.53 (closed at 3.30), June '21 12c for 2.88 (closed at 3.45), and Sep '21 16c for 2.55 (closed at 3.00).\n* **$IRTC** added more to a position I began last week when the stock unexpectedly dropped 40% on medicare reimbursement rates that the company states strongly is merely an administrative error. So far it seems analysts are in general agreement, though some are holding their breath. Today I bought Mar '21 220c for 25.06 (closed at 30.60)\n* **$RIOT** believing that $BTC has about bottomed and will be comin' round the mountain soon, I bought some shares and Feb 05 '21 17c for 3.07 (closed at 3.55). Later in the day I added Feb 05 '21 16c for 4.20 (closed at 4.35) and 20.5c for 1.46 (closed at 1.35)\n* **$UNIT** discovering it as a high conviction trade from Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame--and he was pretty right about $GME in a big way, was he not?--I bought a spread of Aug '21 15c for 1.00 (closed at 0.85) and Jan '22 15c at 1.55 (closed at 1.35) and Jan '22 20c for 0.65 (closed at 0.45).\n* **$NNOX** bought May '21 70c at 17.00 (closed at 17.50) and Aug '21 90c at 17.56 (closed at 30.50 - nice!)\n* **$FUBO** bought Apr '21 50c at 16.05 (closed at 17.30). This was an add to a prior stock and option position.\n* **$RDFN** added to my position here as well. Bought May '21 80c at 9.26 (closed at 9.70) and Aug '21 90c at 9.46 (closed at 10.00).\n* **$PCG** based on some unusual call option activity I noticed, I sold some Mar '21 11p and bought several different calls: Mar '21 12c, 14c; and Jun '21 13c, 15, and 17c. Probably spent too much on commissions here. Whatev. I'm learning the best strategies not just through learning and reviewing theory but also by experimenting with actual trades.\n* **$GME** \\- and this was my revenge trade. I lost a lot of money on this last week, buying shares on the way up then getting stopped out when IBKR halted my ability to do anything but close out. And close out I did at nearly 50% losses. Plus my whole portfolio suffered as brokers, funds and everyone else was liquidating to cover their shorts. In any case, I did a safe trade and a risky trade:\n\n1. Safe: sold Jan '22 25p for 10.00 and 10p for 2.55. Being so far out they haven't moved.. yet.\n2. Risky: bought Feb 05 '21 220p for 53.61 (closed at 52.00) and 190p for 38.59 (closed at 36.20).\n\nOther holdings (some stock, some options, some both):\n\n$TSLA $FVRR $FLGT $ARKK $ARKQ $ARKG $ARKW $SNDL $SOXL $SWKS $EXPI $VXRT $AMZN $PRNT $REGI $ETHE $IPO $LABU $AXON $NERD $TAN $SI $TTGT $SPCX $IPOF $QCLN $NOW $MGNI $SAVA $PENN $WKHS $PBW $SCYX $EDC $WPRT $BUG $ALT\n\nOpen to feedback, questions, your thoughts and insights. Trying to give back for all I've learned here and elsewhere. Cheers!",

        "selftext": "Hey guys! I am quite new to stock market and trading so I\u2019d like to ask you a question I tried to dig into but failed to find any reasoning. \n\nIs anyone here into Skyworks right now? Just recently I bought some SWKS stock and within days it experienced quite good growth as a result (as i understand) of some good reports. \n\nJust recently it fell quite hard, like 10%. And I do not understand why. I searched a lot of news and the only major thing that came up just at that time was some news about Stimulus in the US. But I failed to relate this news to this stock.. so my question is: what was the reason for such a drop? Is it that the stock was overpriced in the first place and it has something with fundamentals? \n\nI am sorry for such silly questions, I just want to understand what info am I missing and try to do better DD in the future.",
