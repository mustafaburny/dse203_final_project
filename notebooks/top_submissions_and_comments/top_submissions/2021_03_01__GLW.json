Here's a snippet from [FDN Management Report 2018](https://fileserver.fdn.com.co/Descarga?ruta=fdn/RENDCUENTAS/00004/FDNINFPRE000040012020120201.pdf) showing Torres' nomination and FDN's focus on developing mobile communications.\n\n*Processing img 1tdnz4venmk61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs stated before, AST SpaceMobile has Telef\u00f3nica as a customer, but why would a guy who hasn't been affiliated with them for a while represent the company on AST board?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[From AST &amp; Science presentation](https://preview.redd.it/x46yj8q0xmk61.png?width=2552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80aa8455a4a251b9dcf38062ecb348511e075fc6)\n\nWith Torres' history in Telef\u00f3nica, infrastructure investment and his present role at FDN I'd say there's a decent chance Colombia is somehow in cahoots with AST SpaceMobile. Maybe FDN will end up jointly financing Telef\u00f3nica's Movistar SpaceMobile service. Or Colombia's a carriers' SpaceMobiles. Without diving deeper into FDN, sounds like a thing they could do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bull case for Tecnoglass (TGLS):**\n\n* Mr. Torres is in the board of Tecnoglass, which merged with the first Andina Acquisition SPAC all the way back in 2013 and is trading now as TGLS at around $7,5. Tecnoglass makes glass.\n* Leading glass manufacturer Corning says [Satellites need glass](https://www.corning.com/au/en/innovation/the-glass-age/science-of-glass/space-exploration-depends-on-crystal-clear-view.html), so Tecnoglass to the moon? Not sure if Tecnoglass' tech is on Corning level, which I presume is the top dog, but still. \n* SpaceMobile would be a great reference customer for Tecnoglass and a brilliant vehicle to tell the story of material excellence which every material producer wants to do.\n* Obviously this is not a bear case but rather a *non-bull case* for NPA, since not much changes for them in this scenario. As an industry challenger maybe Tecnoglass would work even harder to make AST collaboration successful than bigger companies.\n* I'm not a satellite expert, sorry\n* I know most of you have been waiting for post-despac news on Tecnoglass.\n\n  \n**Bull case for ANDA  \ud83d\ude80**\n\n[Stryve will orbit with SpaceMobile.](https://preview.redd.it/kj9uv8wewmk61.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c01e52438f57bda42da05992597fd2c50afe14aa)\n\n  \nNot sure how big of a bull this is potentially for anyone. Maybe a cute bull-calf. \n\nOn the other hand Mr. Torres could just represent some or all customers with interests in Latin America.  Besides Telef\u00f3nica those include at least Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Colombian operator Tigo and Liberty Latin America with networks around Middle America and the Caribbean. \n\nConnections matter, but maybe they simply felt he's a good choice.  \nPositions:   \nLong &lt;100 NPA  \nLong &lt;1000 ANDAW  \nLong  &lt;100 ANDA \n\nMy portfolio lost 4% during the research and writing this post \ud83d\ude11",

The Company owns and operates a  35,000 sf indoor facility in Coalinga, CA which is home to our nursery,  cultivation, distribution, and future extraction business.\u00a0 NGW has an  exclusive seed library consisting of 120 cannabis strains and hybrids  including award-winning cultivars and is producing high quality tissue  culture plantlets through its proprietary cloning technology with  bio-tech leader[ Precigen.](https://precigen.com/)\u00a0 Marketing, product design and formulation are produced in-house, please follow along us at [www.nextgreenwave.com](http://www.nextgreenwave.com/) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nextgreenwave), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nextgreenwave/), or [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/company/nextgreenwave).\n\n**For more information regarding Next Green Wave please contact:**\n\n**Ryan Lange**  \nCMO\n\nTel: +1 (604) 684-6844\n\n[IR@nextgreenwave.com](mailto:IR@nextgreenwave.com)\n\n***Neither Canadian Securities Exchange (the \u201cCSE\u201d) nor its  Regulation Services Providers (as that term is defined in the policies  of the CSE) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this  release.***\n\n\\*All financial information is provided in U.S. dollars and is  unaudited and is subject to change.\u00a0 Any preliminary unaudited long-term  financial projections provided herein have not been prepared in  accordance with IFRS. Management uses non-IFRS financial measures, in  addition to IFRS financial measures, to understand and compare operating  results across accounting periods, for financial and operational  decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate  the Company\u2019s financial performance.\u00a0 One example of a non-IFRS  financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which has limitations as an  analytical tool as it excludes from net income as reported, interest,  tax, depreciation, other income and expenses, non-cash grow costs  expensed for biological assets and unsold inventory, \u200eand the non-cash  fair value effects of accounting for biological assets and inventories.\u00a0  Management believes that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect the  Company\u2019s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful  comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate  comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of  peer companies. Management also believes that these non-IFRS financial  measures enable investors to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating results  and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-IFRS  financial measures may also exclude expenses and gains that may be  unusual in nature, non-cash, infrequent or not reflective of the  Company\u2019s ongoing operating results.\u00a0 As there are no standardized  methods of calculating these non-IFRS measures, the Company\u2019s methods  may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these  measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures  used by others. Accordingly, Non-IFRS financial measures should not be  considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and  should only be considered in conjunction with IFRS financial Measures.\n\n***Next Green Wave Forward Looking Statements***\n\n*This press release contains forward-looking statements within the  meaning of applicable securities laws.

This forward-looking information  reflects NGW\u2019s current beliefs and is based on information currently  available to NGW and on assumptions NGW believes are reasonable.*\n\n*Forward-looking information is subject to known and unknown  risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results,  events or developments to be materially different from any future  results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward  looking information. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors  include, among others: dependence on obtaining and maintaining  regulatory approvals, including acquiring and renewing state, local or  other licenses and any inability to obtain all necessary governmental  approvals licenses and permits to complete construction of its proposed  facilities in a timely manner; engaging in activities which currently  are illegal under US federal law and the uncertainty of existing  protection from U.S. federal or other prosecution; regulatory or  political change such as changes in applicable laws and regulations,  including U.S. state-law legalization, particularly in California, due  to inconsistent public opinion, perception of the medical-use and  adult-use marijuana industry, bureaucratic delays or inefficiencies or  any other reasons; any other factors or developments which may hinder  market growth; NGW\u2019s limited operating history and lack of historical  profits; reliance on management; NGW\u2019s requirements for additional  financing, and the effect of capital market conditions and other factors  on capital availability,\u00a0 competition, including from more established  or better financed competitors; the need to secure and maintain  corporate alliances and partnerships, including with customers and  suppliers; and\u00a0 risks\u00a0 and\u00a0 delays\u00a0 resulting\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 COVID-19\u00a0  pandemic. These factors should be considered carefully, and readers are  cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking  statements. Although NGW has attempted to identify important risk  factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ  materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may  be other risk factors that cause actions, events or results to differ  from those anticipated, estimated or intended.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d), a publicly traded company focused on raising capital for exploration mainly in the base metal and resource sectors. The Company is focused on providing investors with long-term capital growth by investing in a portfolio of undervalued companies and assets.\r\n\r\nOne such asset is the Jasper Property which is wholly owned by the Company. The property is located in west-central Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and consists of 4 mineral claims covering 3978 hectares.\r\n\r\nPrevious work done on the property included soil and rock sampling, geological mapping, drilling and limited geophysical work. This work confirmed the presence of lower Jurassic Bonanza Group, which comprises predominantly tuffaceous volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nMineralization discovered in outcrop over a 2.5 by 0.5 km area on the property consists of 15 sulphide zones. The results include: \r\n\r\n\u25cf\tOutcrop sampling included: zinc: 0.01% to 15.00%, copper: 0.09% to 8.38%, lead: 0.01% to 20.07%, gold: 0.019 g/t to 0.214 g/t and silver: 3.04g/t to 61.45g/t\r\n\u25cf\tDrilling results showed zinc: 0.146% to 11.570%, copper: 0.011% to 0.871%, lead: 0.003% to 6.330%, gold 0,006g/t to 0,05g/t and silver: 2.50g/t to 61.45g/t\r\n\r\nThe model given at the time was hydrothermally remobilized base metal mineralization related to either one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u25cf\tPolymetallic Veins Ag-Pb-Zn+/-Au.\r\n\u25cf\tEpithermal Au-Ag-Cu High Sulphidation.\r\n\u25cf\tCu+/-Ag Quartz Veins.\r\n\u25cf\tNoranda/ Kuroko massive Cu-Pb-Zn. \r\n\u25cf\tPorphyry Cu-Mo-Au.\r\n\r\nEither one of this type of geological settings may point to geological occurrences conducive to mineralization worthy of evaluation, by way of a drill program. Considerable technical re-evaluation is currently underway to take the geophysical interpretations into consideration. The results will be released once available.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe recent surge in copper price is quite encouraging for the future outlook of the Company. Every major economy in the world is preparing for an infrastructure boom which should be favorable for all base metal producers. The Company is well positioned to fully exploit this potential base metals boom and to bring value to its shareholders\u201d said Herb Brugh, President of the Company. \u201cThe Company is looking forward to the results of the re-evaluation becoming available.\u201d\r\n \r\n \r\nThe Qualified Person for the Jasper Property is Jacques Houle, B.A.Sc., University of Toronto \u2013 Geological Engineering \u2013 Min. Ex. Option P.Eng. since 1989 Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of B.C.\r\n\r\nCorporation contact:\r\n\r\nHerb Brugh\r\nPresident and Director\r\nTel:\t416.945.6630",

Management uses non-IFRS financial measures, in  addition to IFRS financial measures, to understand and compare operating  results across accounting periods, for financial and operational  decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate  the Company\u2019s financial performance.\u00a0 One example of a non-IFRS  financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which has limitations as an  analytical tool as it excludes from net income as reported, interest,  tax, depreciation, other income and expenses, non-cash grow costs  expensed for biological assets and unsold inventory, \u200eand the non-cash  fair value effects of accounting for biological assets and inventories.\u00a0  Management believes that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect the  Company\u2019s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful  comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate  comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of  peer companies. Management also believes that these non-IFRS financial  measures enable investors to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating results  and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-IFRS  financial measures may also exclude expenses and gains that may be  unusual in nature, non-cash, infrequent or not reflective of the  Company\u2019s ongoing operating results.\u00a0 As there are no standardized  methods of calculating these non-IFRS measures, the Company\u2019s methods  may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these  measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures  used by others. Accordingly, Non-IFRS financial measures should not be  considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and  should only be considered in conjunction with IFRS financial Measures.\n\n***Next Green Wave Forward Looking Statements***\n\n*This press release contains forward-looking statements within the  meaning of applicable securities laws.

This forward-looking information  reflects NGW\u2019s current beliefs and is based on information currently  available to NGW and on assumptions NGW believes are reasonable.*\n\n*Forward-looking information is subject to known and unknown  risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results,  events or developments to be materially different from any future  results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward  looking information. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors  include, among others: dependence on obtaining and maintaining  regulatory approvals, including acquiring and renewing state, local or  other licenses and any inability to obtain all necessary governmental  approvals licenses and permits to complete construction of its proposed  facilities in a timely manner; engaging in activities which currently  are illegal under US federal law and the uncertainty of existing  protection from U.S. federal or other prosecution; regulatory or  political change such as changes in applicable laws and regulations,  including U.S. state-law legalization, particularly in California, due  to inconsistent public opinion, perception of the medical-use and  adult-use marijuana industry, bureaucratic delays or inefficiencies or  any other reasons; any other factors or developments which may hinder  market growth; NGW\u2019s limited operating history and lack of historical  profits; reliance on management; NGW\u2019s requirements for additional  financing, and the effect of capital market conditions and other factors  on capital availability,\u00a0 competition, including from more established  or better financed competitors; the need to secure and maintain  corporate alliances and partnerships, including with customers and  suppliers; and\u00a0 risks\u00a0 and\u00a0 delays\u00a0 resulting\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 COVID-19\u00a0  pandemic. These factors should be considered carefully, and readers are  cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking  statements. Although NGW has attempted to identify important risk  factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ  materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may  be other risk factors that cause actions, events or results to differ  from those anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance  that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual  results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated  in forward-looking statements. NGW has no obligation to update any  forward-looking statement, even if new information becomes available as a  result of future events, new information or for any other reason except  as required by law.*",
