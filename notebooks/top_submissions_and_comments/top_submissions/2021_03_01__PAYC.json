        "selftext": "Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. \n\nOver the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden\u2019s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. \n\nThe prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today\u2019s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. \n\nHighlights\nThe ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.\n\nShares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.\n\nShares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting.

        "selftext": "You've probably heard the news by now that 6 Dr Seuss books will no longer be published for imagery that has been deemed racist. Regardless of your political beliefs, we're all here to make MONEY. Basic supply and demand indicates that discontinued books will skyrocket in value if demand increases. Sure enough, within two days, these banned Dr Seuss books are now worth their weight in [fucking gold](https://www.cbr.com/dr-seuss-banned-books-sell-high-pries-seconday-market/).\n\nHere's a breakdown by numbers. I'm using data from Barnes and Noble online to establish the normal hardcover price, and then the lowest price on Amazon to establish approximate selling price after it was announced that they will no longer be published:\n\n* The Cat's Quizzer\n   * $9.99 ---&gt; $499.99 **(4,905% increase)**\n* If I Ran the Zoo\n   * $17.99 ---&gt; $594.00 **(3,202% increase)**\n* On Beyond Zebra\n   * $16.99 ---&gt; $425.25 **(2,403% increase)**\n* Scrambled Eggs Super\n   * $14.75 ---&gt; $325.00 **(2,103% increase)**\n* McElligot's Pool\n   * $19.99 ---&gt; $325.00 **(1,526% increase)**\n* And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street\n   * $16.99 ---&gt; $224.25 **(1,220% increase)**\n\nEvery single one of these is a literal ten-bagger. What's even more crazy is that this [Insider article](https://www.insider.com/classic-childrens-books-that-havent-aged-well-2019-5#if-i-ran-the-zoo-by-theodor-seuss-geisel-aka-dr-seuss-has-been-criticized-for-containing-numerous-offensive-images-1) sort of called it almost two years ago\u2014the first book on their list is If I Ran the Zoo. In addition to the above mentioned Insider article, I looked through several lists of books that are being challenged for racial content. My analysis leads me to believe that *The Indian in the Cupboard* by Lynne Reid Banks, currently being published by Harper Collins, is a prime candidate for a discontinued book squeeze. Here's why:\n\n1. **Low Search Volume**. Here's a Google trends graph of how often the recalled Dr Seuss books were searched for on Amazon. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d178buhtl2l61.png?width=2322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ad443bc373d439abe34e87d8fbd8c8d04ffd32a\n\nNotice how there's nobody trying to buy these books? This makes sense. No publisher in their right mind would discontinue a popular children's book. This is why books like *The Cat in the Hat* or *Peter Pan*, which have also been criticized, will never go out of print. It would be a financial nightmare.\n\nIn contrast, look at how Indian in the Cupboard stacks up against some other contenders:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xe9dbpun2l61.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e3995810de807ae599684cd690ba7efc2149b7\n\nIf you follow the red trendline, you will see that searches for \"Indian in the Cupboard Amazon\" are effectively 0 with some slight upticks every now and then. This contrasts with Amazon searches for titles like Little House on the Prairie, which sees consistent search frequency. Discontinuing further printings of The Indian in the Cupboard will probably have little impact on HarperCollins' margins.\n\n2. **Broad readership base, particularly among middle-aged readers.** In addition to being discontinued, a book will need to have excess demand before the price will surge. This will happen only if the book has a broad readership base. In Dr Seuss's case, so many adults have probably read at least one of the 6 discontinued books growing up (hell I loved Mulberry Street when I was little), which is why they're actually buying up these books now that they've become limited edition items. It probably helps that Dr Seuss wrote his books to help children read and literally every elementary school still uses his writing to teach literacy skills.\n\nSimilarly, *The Indian in the Cupboard* was actually well-received in the 80s and was incorporated into school curriculums nationwide. You can still find entire teaching guides built around *The Indian in the Cupboard*, and I distinctly remember reading this book and filling out worksheets back in third grade 2009. Yeah, this book isn't as popular as it once was, but I'm willing to bet that in the 40 years that it's been out, it's been able to build a solid fanbase of readers who will buy a copy out of nostalgia once this book gets banned. This also gives *The Indian in the Cupboard* an advantage over books like *Pippi Longstocking,* which\u2014despite being a children's book with low search volume\u2014is beloved in Sweden but has a much smaller audience in America.\n\n3. **History of contentious debate.** The controversy over Dr Seuss's books didn't just happen overnight (although it certainly felt that way). His books have been banned in libraries for years and there are [arguments](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/reckoning-dr-seuss-racist-imagery-has-been-years-making-n1259330) going all the way back to the 90s about whether his books are racist. This is the same situation that *The Indian in the Cupboard* finds itself in. It's been removed from numerous public libraries and the American Library Association leadership advised educators to avoid the book as far back as 1991. This is important because the decision to remove books is typically time-sensitive. Given almost 30 years to consider whether or not to discontinue publishing, Harper Collins likely has enough financial data and a good picture of consumer preferences, especially under the current political climate, to decide that they will stop further publications of *The Indian in The Cupboard*. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind that there is significantly less liquidity with trading books than stocks. However, books are still less volatile and, like art pieces, tend to appreciate in value over time. I think that *The Indian in the Cupboard* is a long-term hold which has the potential to increase ten fold when it inevitably gets pulled from circulation.",

        "selftext": "Okay so here are my thoughts. Behind Nestle, PepsiCo is the biggest company in it's sector by revenue. It also follows Coke stock fairly closely. But what made the difference this last year was how these two comparable soda giants fared during covid 19.\n\nKO or Coke performed extremely poorly and made less money yoy. It's payout ratio for its dividend was touching 94%. Meaning they only had 6% left over after paying out their shareholders. That's not a lot of money to do much of anything with. ESPECIALLY in an industry that needs to move towards new products with the decline in popularity of Soda.\n\nTo compare with PepsiCo, which even during the pandemic found a way to make more revenue in 2020 than in 2019.\n\nTo give you specific numbers, in 2018 was an increase in total revenue by 1.79% compared to 2017. In 2019 it increased 3.87% compared to 2018, and in 2020 increased a 4.78% which might I remind you that this increase happened during the pandemic. Now why did PepsiCo do well against their main rival coke?\n\nTo answer this in simple terms their portfolio was more diversified than coke's and they focused on releasing new and more popular products as well as packaged food which saw a huge boost in sales from \"Toilet Paper Bandits\" or panic shoppers stocking up on bags of fritos, lays, cheetos, and on the healthier side of things Quaker Oats and other products. Until recently most people thought coke stock was king between the two companies but I believe 2020 may have put pepsi on the podium as our clear winner of the Cola Wars.\n\nPepsi has a dividend yield of 3.12% and a payout ratio of 79.88%\n\nCoke has a dividend yield of 3.35% and a payout ratio of 93.85%\n\nWith the payout ratios so high I am a little concerned for dividend increases for both but I would be shocked if coke raised it any more than they had to to keep their dividend status.\n\nShare price:\n\nI see PepsiCo valued at $154.36 a share\nTrevis Evaluation puts then at $150.16 which I believe is low but close to a 20 dollar per share increase or more either way.\n\nThis is an upside of 18.46% not including dividends.\n\nAnd I calculated Coke to be valued at $52.72 a share.\nTrevis Evaluation puts it at $55.48 which is more than I calculated.\n\nTaking the higher of the two numbers this leave a share price upside of around 11.00%\n\nThere are many other reasons I believe Pepsi is going to be the better long term pick like how they released the new cocktail mixers neon Zebra (which I would love to try) to take some of the cocktail mixer marketshare. Which the mixer market tops 858 MM$ and an industry that grew 35% just last year. Cocktail culture is coming to North America and in the United States and Canada we are heavily accepting these delicious mixers that are premade and easy to make.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these two companies or their sectors in general? Do you think PepsiCo is undervalued? Or do you think Coke is still a better buy? Let me know in the comments.\n\nDisclaimer: I am Long PepsiCo and hold positions in the stock mentioned above.",

        "selftext": "President Biden unveiled the $2.25 trillion [American Jobs Plan](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-ev-rebates-charging-stations/) that includes $174 billion for electrification (building 500,000 EV charging stations, giving direct EV rebates, building EV supply chain in the US) and $270 billion in upgrading train and road infrastructure.\n\nA more robust universally-accessible EV charging infrastructure will accelerate the growth of the entire EV industry and help level the playing field for non-Tesla EVs (Tesla's supercharger network has been a key selling point for Tesla). Being the software provider for 23 out of 25 top EV automakers, Blackberry will also experience the same explosive growth soon.\n\nUpgrading train and road infrastructure might imply the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communication (V2X) to enhance logistical/traffic management for better efficiency, productivity and public safety. As major infrastructure becomes connected to the internet, security will be a major requirement because these infrastructure will become hackable surfaces that can cause serious damage. Blackberry is the leading software provider for mission critical applications, IoT cybersecurity and Unified Endpoints Management (UEM) that has a great track record working closely with governments across the world. It is very likely that Blackberry will win major government contracts soon in this space given its technical expertise in the IoT space and huge engineering workforce in the US.",

        "selftext": "Was happy to see news this morning that Lordstown Motors had the first two beta truck come off the assembly line yesterday. I know I know -- SEC investigation -- yes I know one of their trucks burned to the ground in January on a test drive.\n\nBut i like the way they are doing the trucks.  They actually look like a truck -- compare it to the Cyber truck, and just looks alone it wins hands down.  I also think the hub motors will be the way for EV to go in the future.  The space a motor like Tesla uses can be dedicated to storage area or more battery space for longer distances.\n\nI'm slowly coming to face reality that EV will be what we drive in the next 10 to 15 years.  So I've been watching and reading on different companies.  I do have a few shares of Lordstown (38 shares -- please stop laughing at the small amount.)\n\nHopefully the remaining test trucks come off the line without a hitch, the testing of them goes off without a hitch, and production starts this fall.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/03/31/lordstown-motors-reveals-its-first-two-endurance-betas/](https://electrek.co/2021/03/31/lordstown-motors-reveals-its-first-two-endurance-betas/)",

As you know, the spreads can be ridiculously large (sometimes more than 20%).\n\n\nI recently discovered that when doing a poor man's covered call (pmcc) and it gets assigned, rather than selling the call, my brokerage places  100 short sale stocks per contract into my portfolio and lets me keep the call.\n\nThe spread to buy to cover short stocks seems far less than the call option.\n\nIf I have a LEAP call that I no longer wish to hold, is it materially different to sell the call with a 20% spread loss or do a pmcc and have the call assigned and keep the long call with the shorted shorted shares? It seems like the latter is the same as liquidating but with no spread loss, plus I earn a premium from writing the call option in the pmcc.",

        "selftext": "Take it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. \n\nYou need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.\n\n1. Open webull \n\n2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively \"safe\" yet great returning etf. \n\n3. Go to the \"paper trading\" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). \n\n3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. \n\n4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. \n\n5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.\n\n6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed. No you are getting VTI gains plus if the stocks solid now itll be solid again in 6 months right? The goals a solid return not day trading 200% gains).\n\nPRO TIPS-\n\n-DO NOT FOMO SELL OR BUY STOCKS. I can not emphasize this enough. Ive bought in where things are gaining 5%/ hour and guess what? The stock within a week dropped back down to \"fill the gaps.\" I never believed that was a thing but ive watched it happen way too many times. About 99% of the time a stock i watchlisted shot up if i got it while going up within a  week it temporarily dropped back before rising again. \n\n-Do yourself a favor and avoid Wall s t r e e t b e t s \n\n-Never invest any money you arent willing to lose today. If you need the money soon (within a year in my opinion) and will need that full amount do not invest it. The market especially now is unpredictable. A lot of people lost a lot of money these last 2 months that they will either never get back or will be holding the bag they call it for years. \n\n- Contrary to popular belief... its okay to sell for a loss. This is a hard lesson and one many people will give you a hard time on saying \"BuY hIgH sElL lOw.\" Guess what? Sometimes we pick bad stocks/ etfs. Especially when you are new you will think you found the gold mind of a stock only for it to get bad news like the trial drug didnt get approved or they delayed production or loss a contract bid. Would you rather be down 20% and perhaps watch it keep going down more and hold that stock for years perhaps before it comes back up or would you rather accept the loss (which youll claim on taxes) and then reinvest in a solid company/ etf that will make that loss back faster. Of course this correction we were just in is an expection in someways because some companies will bounce back relatively quick but i forsee that there will be many people that bought in at all time highs who wont see a profit for a very long time. \n\n- In the same respect above you have to have discipline. Stocks dont only go up. You WILL have down days. Youll temporarily be in the red. This will be the pucker moment you decide if you regret buying that position or not. Be disciplined. \n\n-The same goes for being on top. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits if your stock happens to have a huge run up (knowing youll pay capital gains tax though). \n\n- DO NOT USE MARGIN ACCOUNTS \n\n- Avoid option trading for at least a year till you understand what you are doing and can pick good stocks to buy options for. You can lose so much money so fast. \n\n- these subs can be amazing and they can be toxic. Some people give great advice and others dont. Whatever someone tells you dont take it as fact. They may tell you that AMD will double in 6 months buy buy buy. But its your money not theirs you could lose. \n\n- CNBC gets a lot of hate but Squak box, fast money and mad money on Spotify or watching it live has some really good insight to the market. But again they dont always give great advice. \n\n- you have to decide what your plan is and what stocks/ etfs/ risk fits your life style and plan. \n\n- people are scared of dividends for no reason. Unless you are investing millions upon millions of dollars ignoring solid stocks and ETFs which pay dividends to \"avoid unnecessary tax events\" is silly. If you dont believe me look at an ETF like SCHD. calculate the max amount youll ever get in that account. Divide by shares and multiply by dividend rate. Its not that much in end that you pay taxes on.\n\n- as much as we all wanna make 200% every month on every stock thats so unbelievably unrealistic. Look at some of the biggest ETFs like VT, VTI, SCHA, SCHB, VXUS, etc. And see their YOY returns. That your goal.\n\n\nMy advice/ quick tid bit/ plan\n\nI attempted to beat the market. I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.\n\nMy current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). \n\nVTI- 70% \n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nSCHD- 10% \n\nQQQM- 7.5:\n\nQQQJ- 7.5%\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

        "selftext": " This latest installment of why $DGX is **still** the safest double up+ opportunity in the market will likely be my last update before earnings this month (baring eventful news). A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n**TL;DR again** \\- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.\n\n**Positions** \\- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kspcic1dqjq61.jpg?width=3480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05521960a236201679bbda237f3fb5997ad5270a\n\nOpen: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160\n\nAs previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**\n\n**The new stuff:**\n\n* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing: [**https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html)  \n\n   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new \"analyst\" price targets\n* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html)\n* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html)  \n\n   * [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic)\n* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings: [https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf)\n\n**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**\n\n* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.  \n\n   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS &gt; 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.\n   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases\n\nThe reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na\u00efve.** Reasons:\n\n* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.\n* **Political climate / stimulus** \\- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now \"recommending\" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.\n* **$$$$$$$** \\- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.\n\n**Price Expectations by EOY:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by Biden's tax policy, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2\n* Q1 Earnings 4/22\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME.",

We basically built the whole animal around the desired product, but we do not need the animal and it takes rather long to reach \"maturity\" and consumes too much resources along the way. Long story short - we need a more efficient method.\n\nEnter lab meat/fish. Here they produce meat with the help of cells and media in bio reactors, the same ones used for the fermentation of yeast. Same product but less of the downsides of traditional meat and fish:\n- Shorter production time\n- More cost efficient in the future (rough estimate says 2030)\n- no animals are harmed (unless you count the minimal itch it takes to get some cells)\n- one cow = tons of meat (all they need is cells from it)\n- can be produced in a factory, does not need land \n- way smaller CO2 footprint\n- better food quality, no friggin hormones everywhere\n- potentially to be consumed by vegetarians and vegans too (vegans questionable I know)\n\nOne of the most promising companies currently is BlueNalu (https://www.bluenalu.com/) aiming for production later this year. Now almost none of the companies are publicly traded at the moment, but I found a good vehicle to get access: Agronomics\nhttps://agronomics.im/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Agronomics-Corporate-Presentation-.pdf\n\nIf you are interested, I recommend reading the book \"Moo's Law\" by one of the founders, Jim Mellon.

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that BLNK is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. BLNK has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out.

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",

        "selftext": "# Digihost Acquires 60 MW Power Plant Increasing Hashrate Capacity to 3 EH\n\nTORONTO, March 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (\u201cDigihost\u201d or the \u201c**Company**\u201d) (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a binding agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) for the purchase of a 60 MW power plant (\u201c**Digifactory1\u201d**) located in the State of New York, bringing the Company\u2019s total power capacity to approximately 102 MW. The Company\u2019s ability to generate its own power will significantly reduce electricity costs, the Company\u2019s largest operating expense for its cryptocurrency mining operations. It is estimated that with the acquisition of Digifactory1, the all-in cost of electricity will be reduced to under US$0.03 per kw/h.  \n\n\nTo the extent possible, the Company intends to source and utilize renewable natural gas for the operations of Digifactory1 and also engage in the practice of acquiring renewable energy certificates, all in line with the Company\u2019s objective to mitigate its carbon footprint. Digifactory1 will have the capacity to operate an additional 18,000 top tier Bitcoin miners, which if added to the existing fleet of 11,500 miners already in operation, would combine for a total Bitcoin mining capacity of approximately 400 Bitcoins per month as of today\u2019s mining difficulty factor. Additionally, the expanded capacity would allow for a potential increase to the existing hashrate of 190 PH to up to 3 EH. This substantial increase in both Bitcoin mining output capacity and hashrate would be the direct result of potentially adding up to 18,000 latest generation Bitcoin miners, versus the current operating mix of 11,500 older and newer version Bitcoin miners.\n\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the Company will pay to the vendor cash consideration of US$3,500,000 and issue to the vendor 437,318 common shares of the Company with a deemed value of US$750,000 (US$1.72 per share).\n\nAlec Amar, the Company\u2019s President stated: \u201cWe are extremely excited to have achieved this milestone in the evolution of our Company. Vertical integration is a fundamental aspect of our business model, which will enable us to maximize Bitcoin mining efficiency and continuing to create sustainable value for our shareholders. The addition of Digifactory1 will further reduce the electricity costs of our already efficient operations, and will also provide additional capacity to operate a new fleet of top tier Bitcoin miners.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/24/2198342/0/en/Digihost-Acquires-60-MW-Power-Plant-Increasing-Hashrate-Capacity-to-3-EH.html)\n\n  \n\n# Digihost Acquires 700 S17+ 76TH Bitcoin Miners for Immediate Delivery\n\nTORONTO, March 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (\u201cDigihost\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is pleased to announce the acquisition of 700 Bitmain S17+ 76TH miners for a total purchase price of US$4.025 million, that would increase the Company\u2019s hashrate by 50PH, or approximately 20% in the second quarter of 2021. The Bitmain S17+ miners are scheduled for delivery in early April and will be deployed immediately.  \n\n\nThe addition of the 700 Bitmain S17+ miners, based on the current price of Bitcoin (\u201c**BTC**\u201d) and level of mining difficulty, would increase the Company\u2019s monthly mined BTC by approximately 9 BTC, which would translate to an additional US$400,000 of operating profit per month. The new miners will be installed at the Company\u2019s existing mining facility in Upstate New York.\n\nMichel Amar, the Company\u2019s CEO, stated: \u201cWe continue to aggressively pursue every new opportunity that aligns with our goal to expand operations through the strategic acquisition of Bitcoin miners and low-cost sources of clean energy. The acquisition and immediate deployment of these new miners is the first in, what we expect to be, many new acquisitions going forward. We are excited to implement our plan to utilize the expanded 3EH hashing capacity from our recently announced acquisition of a 60MW power plant (*press release: March 24, 2021*), where it is expected that the Company\u2019s energy cost would be further reduced by up to 40%.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/29/2200616/0/en/Digihost-Acquires-700-S17-76TH-Bitcoin-Miners-for-Immediate-Delivery.html)\n\n**About Digihost Technology Inc.**  \nDigihost Technology Inc. (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is a growth-oriented blockchain technology company primarily focused on Bitcoin mining. The Company's mining facilities are located in Upstate New York, and are equipped with 78.7 MW of low-cost power with the option to expand to 102MW.

(Although it is a bit outdated, the information is insightful and Michael Burry is leading us to it)\n\n**So what sticks out to me:**\n\n1. &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18s07nx4lhq61.jpg?width=294&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f86ce49c15ff2eccf34d031e0129ee09c42aae8\n\n2.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jrlxae7nhq61.jpg?width=319&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b98e4ede6f06ef8562d6c039c5e138b88ace48b\n\nDid I read that right, 7 times as many treasury security backed assets as they own!?! and this is just 2018...\n\n3.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/522gn9j8nhq61.jpg?width=408&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f963eceba95828408aba0ce2391f43b738cdd3ed\n\nSo this part about the eSLR rule is interesting, but it didn't hold up. Next I will show some 2020 data from the same author which shows the collateral multiplier back up around 9 in April 2020.Source: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020103pap.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020103pap.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8h5xnu1ohq61.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a334a1c4d758f5364a51f8f61362d7f6f271e74f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3vkyi49ohq61.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e2c2dab4e6145fcc80504ebf97585d100bfaaf\n\nNotice collateral multiplier is defined as the ratio between the black line (U.S. Treasury SFTs) and the red line (non-rehypothecated).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould a much smarter ape like u/atobitt give some insight here? This looks huge, but I don't completely understand what I'm looking at here.\n\nSorry if it's a bit rushed, I wrote it during my lunch break. I'll respond to comments later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Great analysis from u/weeknddev \n\n&gt;7x leverage on encumbered capital and more than 85% is rehypothecated. This is like taking 85% of the same banana until there is no banana left. I would suspect that 7x exposure is low. Why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those who do not exceed 700b in capital only have to report monthly as of this publication. That means at any given time they could be several factors more rehypothecated betting like fucking degenerates. And like in other posts because their money comes from derivatives, they are able to sell them and make out like bandits. Truly bandits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since we effectively blocked their get out of jail free card by holding so damn hard they cannot come up with those rehypothecated shares. They are beyond fucked .. but we might be too.\n\nAll I can say is, buy and HODL is the way.\n\n**Important: Let\u2019s Spread Awareness**\n\nMy dear Apes check this out.\nLet\u2019s spread awareness of what an massive fraud is happening currently on the stock markets. What better way is there than than educating ourselves and others?\n\n\n**Not financial advice**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just an idiat who has no clue what he\u2019a taklking about. I just like the stock.\n\n**Original source** by u/RichHodler",

        "selftext": "I got in at $13 after reading of it on wallstreetbets but ended up selling it at around $17 because I thought it\u2019s amazing that something I got from wallstreetbets actually went up, time to take profit. I was a pussy basically. Then I saw it went up to $30s then $100s then $300s and as many I started reading more on it but decided not to chase it. Then saw it come back down to $40 but just thought to myself I dodged a bullet, even though I could have stayed in at $13 purchase and not sell but it could be worse and I could have gotten it and $300. Then I saw it going back up and while all of this was happening I went balls deep reading the DDs on wsb/gme and really understood what was going on but again decided to stay away cause I didn\u2019t want anything close to betting. But clearly it didn\u2019t stay that way and my whole plan changed when I took my mothers to doctors, we were sitting in the waiting area and I had some heart to heart with my mother (she recently lost her brother and got sick right after) She went to use the restroom and I opened wsb and saw DFV post his account update. That happened to be exactly at the time when $GME had gone back up from $40s back to above $100s, but that day it was red. It dipped below $100 and I set the limit for $88 to go all in and guess what $GME low was that day.. around $86.5. I got my shares and right after it started going up.\nAnd it was the last time $GME dipped below $100. I consider myself extremely lucky I got a good buy point even though I was nowhere in the earliest of people who deserve all the returns in this more then anyone cause they believed in the stock from the start but I am so glad I got in this cause at that moment it felt so right. It still feels right. This was about 40 days back and i have deleted my stock account from my phone so I don\u2019t even think of selling it, I want..need this to change my life around, had pretty much the worst time of my life since I lost everything in 2018 and this seemed like the best way to do it. I put whatever I have now In gme and honestly it doesn\u2019t matter if I got in at $88 or $200 when it\u2019s at +$10000. It\u2019s good to be in this journey with you guys. Thanks to you guys I got in this and got this opportunity to see the worth. I believe in this company and I HOLD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSorry for any English mistakes, not my first language.

My vision is to increase my trading account by +80000% this year, going from 100 USD to 80k USD.\n\nI know it sounds insane, but I actually have a plan for this.\n\nAll the best,\n\nJoel",

        "selftext": "This latest installment of why $DGX is **still** the safest double up+ opportunity in the market will likely be my last update before earnings this month (baring eventful news). A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n**TL;DR again** \\- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.\n\n**Positions** \\- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gb2taxvojq61.jpg?width=3480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb95029912abbf651f90edff2079c88361902d4b\n\nOpen: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160\n\nAs previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**\n\n**The new stuff:**\n\n* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing: [**https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html)\n   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new \"analyst\" price targets\n* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html)\n* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html)\n   * [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic)\n* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings: [https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf)\n\n**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**\n\n* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.\n   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS &gt; 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.\n   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases\n\nThe reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na\u00efve.** Reasons:\n\n* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.\n* **Political climate / stimulus** \\- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now \"recommending\" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.\n* **$$$$$$$** \\- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.\n\n**Price Expectations by EOY:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by Biden's tax policy, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2\n* Q1 Earnings 4/22\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME.",
