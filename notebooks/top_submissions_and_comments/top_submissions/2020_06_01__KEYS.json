        "selftext": "It is 6/17 of the year 2030. You wake up at the designated time thanks to the screech of your assigned alarm. The noise pierces your brain, doubly so after echoing off the bare metal walls of your dark room. Mechanically, you open your phone and watch the sponsored Rokugle\u00a9\ufe0f content required to silence the shrill cries. The bright colors and soft hissing of the released dopamine gas fill you with joy as you see the CEO of America, your lord and savior Jay Powell The Printer, appear on the screen you toiled so hard for.  \n\nIt was 10 years ago to the day that you you bought those fateful ROKU 7/17/2020 240c\u2019s. Before June\u2019s end ROKU was acquired by Google and you were so ecstatic to have finally made something of yourself. Looking for that fabled 10,000 bagger however, you held on for dear life. By July 4th, Google along with every other corporation was bought up by the Fed- save for a single supposedly cursed company. Prices went to the moon as truly infinite QE became priced in. Ah yes, those were the days. When men were men who fought bears, tendies were real tendies, and kangaroos only an Australian marsupial wholly unrelated to the stock market. Of course by now inflation meant those gains were nearly worthless, but they were enough to buy a top shelf phone in order to see each and every illustrious pore of Jpow\u2019s face in 16k ultra definition. \n\nJay Powell\u2019s voice is an anthem of truth and victory as he announces that repo operations are going smoothly and will be increasing from 250T to 300T nightly. You shiver. Powell assures you almost personally that the Fed will use the full extent of their power- indeed every tool in their toolbox- until America is safe. Pure bullish ecstasy courses through your veins.\n\nThe announcement ends but the presence of The Printer lives on inside you, urging you onward to productivity. Or perhaps that\u2019s just the neural mplant. Nonetheless you make your way to your designated work station tucked away in the corner of your room. From a boxy speaker emerges a word, a silver toned instruction which graces your ears and entwines itself with your very being.\n\n\u201cPrint\u201d peals the voice of Jay.\n\nYou obey. \n\nYou hold shift and your palms start sweating. Then you gingerly press \u201cb\u201d. Anticipation builds. You release the two keys. A flawless \u201cB\u201d appears on the terminal. Your heart races. It is finally time. Your eyes fervently turn to the key you know to be \u201cr\u201d even though the lettering on it had long ago been worn away. You voraciously hold it down as you crane your neck up to gaze back to the screen. \n\n\u201cBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u201d is printed in a pleasantly bland font on an equally bland background. You cannot contain it anymore and a euphoric moan escapes your lips, only to be echoed back at you and redoubled by the voices of your neighbors and indeed the entire American working class as they too all Print. You know it is but a fraction of divinity as compared to Jay as he sits locked upon his Printer Throne. He dedicates the entirety of his almighty JPower to convert the \u201cBrr\u201d signals into liquid currency to print the USA into safety while kindly reassuring the good people that all is well. You release the \u201cr\u201d key eight rapturous hours later. \n\nOnly one more task sits between you and a piping hot plate of Beyond Meat tendies. Your sharpen your senses and steel your will to a razor point in order to execute a dire task, one integral to the continued function of the Greatest Country on Earth. Yesterday, someone had committed the most heinous of crimes and justice demanded it be corrected. A single order for a SPY 220p had been discordantly placed, which deviated algorithms from their perfect 12% upward trend. A Dip was created and it threatened all of society. When you heard it the news your blood boiled in righteous fury. How dare someone bet against America?! So you volunteered to go to the front lines and fight. \n\nAnd fight you will, so you open the Robinhood app and place an order for 50 7/17 SPY 330c\u2019s. It fills. Relief washes your anger away. America is now safe. As you go to exit the app however, your fat thumbs accidentally buy another option as well. An evil chill settles down your spine as you see something you thought impossible mere moments before; it was not an option on SPY. You go to cancel the order, but long hours of printing have dulled your reflexes. Too slow. Robinhood notifies you that they are experiencing server issues and cannot cancel the order. Your breath catches in your throat. The lights in your building shut down, and even your trusty tendy microwave\u2019s time readout is empty and lifeless. You are cast into claustrophobic, all consuming darkness. \n\nMoments lasting an eternity pass and in the distance you hear a furious angelic droning. \n\u201cBrr\u201d \nMaybe they\u2019ll understand it was a mistake, you reason. It gets louder.\n\u201cBrrrrrr\u201d\nThey won\u2019t understand. Your ears are ringing now.\n\u201cBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u201d \nHow could it have gone so wrong? \n\u201cBRRRRRRRRR\u201d\nThe outer wall of your room is torn asunder and your nostrils are assaulted by the acrid outside air while the sound of printing engulfs you, almost subsuming your entire sense of self. Pieces of something- you realize it is shards of your wall- whizz past your ears in a flurry. The droning revs up, and the all-consuming \u201cBRR\u201d climaxes with a trio of wet thuds. It takes a moment to realize the thuds came from your own body as you look incredulously down at three of fat stacks of $100 bills sticking halfway out of your chest. Your shirt suddenly feels warm against your skin.\n\n\u201cDIRECT LIQUIDITY INJECTION COMPLETE.\u201d booms a metallic voice.\n\nThe voice\u2019s owner appears to be a gleaming throne of gold and printer-ink composite, illuminated by the twin jets of fire that propelled it through the night sky and through your wall. Stack upon stack of printed bills flow from the bowels of the great machine before you. Atop it sits a mythologically massive figure in a smartly cut suit, from whom a palpable pressure of printing prowess emanates across the room. This is the legendary Jay Powell in the flesh. Unnlike his typical flawless visage, of which you are intimately acquainted through 16k ultra definition streaming, there is an unfamiliar glint marring his features. It is a single teardrop that catches and bends the thrones flames and thus itself burns away the darkness. The sight eats away at your soul and brings you even worse pain than the very literal and extremely physical wounds in your chest. You failed America. You failed Him. \n\n\u201cYou are not the first nor will you be the last. I have no choice, for I must use all tools available. For what it is worth however, I am sorry my child\u201d says the voice that had comforted you every morning, but instead of the usual triumphant tones it is weary and hollow. \n\nYour fingers are cold. You try to wiggle them in vain as your eyes find Jay\u2019s. You attempt to explain how it was a mistake and that you\u2019re sorry, but your voice fails you too. The cold creeps up your arms while your torso is too warm and wet. Why is it wet? You wonder idly that this cannot be real, but know deep down with frigid certainty that this is it. \n\nThe edges of your world fade while the radiant figure of Jay fills your vision. He plucks up your still-unlocked phone from a pile of dollars and debris, pushes his glasses up, and reads the screen. Without warning his powerful frame crumples in defeat like an ancient sun giving way to inevitable singularity.\n\n \u201cI am too late.\u201d he laments in barely more than a whisper.\n\nAs if to echo his grief, across America millions of voices cry out in a single unified GUH as their positions approach negative infinity. Then that too fades and all that remains is a broken room, a broken man, and a broken printer.\n\nA reflection of your phone screen remains in his spectacles. Staring back at you in his eyes is the option that brought tragedy and doom to you, to the once great Jay, and to the entire nation. The last thing you see as the coldness reaches your core is that accursed screen:\n\n\u201cWoohoo! \ud83d\ude3a Your order to buy to open 2 contracts of MSFT $200 call 7/17 has been filled at an average price of $4.20 per contract.\n\nYour order is complete.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Going on 2 years now, I have enjoyed unlimited day trading options with an account under 25K. No, not by making weird spreads and strategies like that. Just making call or put options only. Zero spreads. I can easily trade in my cash account on unsettled funds,  $1 to open a contract, $0 to close, fast, instant order fills, and an easy, user friendly platform.  Do I got your attention yet? Well, the answer is tastytrades cash account.  Here are some of the keys.\n1.  Instead of 3 day trade strikes, it is 5 day trade strikes before the 3 month ban.\n2.  Whether you make 2 day trade or 50 day trades in a day, the max is 1 strike per day.\n3.  Trading on unsettled funds in a cash account is a non-factor. Tasty is the only broker that allows this.\n4.   Unlimited cash accounts allowed. I have 13 cash accounts with tasty. Easy to setup, quick deposits/withdrawals, and no hassle/no questions asked ever.\n\nThe PDT rule is a non-factor. It's true, I'm proof. Anyone who is serious and wants more info, I guess you can message me.  I dont want your money, I dont need your referral credits,  I'm not trying to get your personal info, or spam you whatever.  I am just willing to help fellow traders with a common problem. Cheers...\n\nThis topic is about unlimited day trading options in a small account. This is not misinformation and not illegal.This topic is not about educating me about how I'm wrong. It's not about name calling.  It's not about IRA  or futures accounts. It's not about who has 25K or not.  It's not about boosting egos or getting upvotes or downvotes.  It's about interpreting the PDT rule, having an open mind, and thinking outside the box.  The PDT rule is a non-factor. All comments are welcome but I will reply to anyone who is serious and has more questions.\n\nFYI the PDT rule is just a rule, it's not the law.  No one has ever been sent to prison over it.\n\nFYI in Tastytrades,  if I make 50 day trades in one day, I will only get 1 violation.    You cant do that in robinhood or td ameritrade.  Make 4 day trades and you're locked out for 90 days.\n\nFYI in a tasty cash account, if you used up all your settled funds for the day, you can still keep trading and not get locked out. Robinhood and td Ameritrade's platform wont let you execute a trade on unsettled funds.",

        "selftext": "What initially caught my attention was the PR on May 27th for Kaival Brands. It went relatively unnoticed here, and I'm led to believe it's because they haven't paid anyone to pump. KAVL pulled me from the hole that MVIS put me in.\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/27/2039728/0/en/Kaival-Brands-Accelerates-Growth-with-Bidi-Vapor-Partnership.html\n\nIn summary, $22.5 million \"for the first half of fiscal 2020\" but when you look deep into their filings, it was literally $22.5 million in revenues for the last two months of that half. Gross profit $4.2 million. At the time of the PR, shares were .06 - now at .15 and I still think this is great entry. I picked up an additional 7,000 shares yesterday at .145. The cost of revenue $18.3 million, and with its related party, Bidi Vapor, LLC. The primary generator of revenue is the Bidi Stick with a variety of flavors.\n\nI looked a bit farther back at Kaival Brands other PR. They announced their EXCLUSIVE distribution agreement with Bidi Vapor, and then subsequently announced non-exclusive distribution agreements with Favs Business &amp; Colonial Wholesale Distributing. The non-exclusive agreements have minimum order requirements per quarter of 1,000,000 Bidi Sticks. This happened in the 2nd quarter. This was/is the kickstart, in my opinion.\n\nBut what about this Bidi Stick? I personally don't vape but I did for a short period of time to quit smoking (2.5 years cigarette free). I searched YouTube and found almost all positive (possibly paid but maybe not) reviews, and multiple websites with five-star ratings. Most of the vape users highlight that the taste is smooth while having a higher nicotine content. Then I went to Google Trends, I wanted to see if the term Bidi Stick is on the rise. Sure enough, since about March, it has finally got some legs.\n\nThe keys to success are more reviews as the product becomes more widely known, and obviously more distribution agreements into retail and online sales. I am expecting, at a minimum, that Kaival Brands posts another $22.5 million for the 3rd quarter, and $4 million in gross profit ($2.8 net).\n\nAlso, KAVL has zero debt. This is not a pump and dump for me, and if I lost everything I had in my pennystock portfolio, it would hurt but I won't lose sleep over it. There is always risk in everything but for some reason this one seems like it aligns with the principles I try to follow.\n\nAnyway, I hope you liked reading about something other than GNUS.",

        "selftext": "I might be completely wrong but I've been observing $ZM since the early start of the pandemic, and I don't believe the stock is a good long-term play. Here are the reasons why I am bearish on the company:\n\n* **Competitive space**. Zoom is competing with many other video conferencing tools: Google Meet (previously, Google Hangouts, $GOOG/L), Skype as well as Teams ($MSFT), and Slack (also offering video calls aside from chat, $WORK) to name a few. All of these provide both free and enterprise plans, and as you can see, many of them are backed by big monopoly tech. There are also smaller players trying to break through like join.me.\n* **Security concerns**. Zoom does not have proper end-to-end encryption. It's been found to transmit its encryption keys and even route the actual calls through China, supposedly by mistake. Despite being a Silicon Valley company, they have much of their staff in China as well. The software itself has been through several privacy scandals, particularly in June 2019 with MacOS users discovering that their camera could be activated by malicious sites due to a vulnerability in Zoom.\n* **Government regulation**. Zoom has alleged ties to China, and with the current US-China tensions, it's at high risk of being regulated. It's already been banned from use by several government agencies (NASA, military) and companies (Google, SpaceX). The precedent has already been set with Huawei, and if the anti-China sentiment and trade sanctions continue to grow, possibly evolving into a cold war, you can expect more scrutiny directed towards this company.\n* **Inflated fundamentals**. The stock is currently trading at a P/E near 6,000 and is slightly down from its ATH this week. It's likely priced for perfection in anticipation of very strong demand even as the economy continues to re-open. Even if you're optimistic about the work-from-home culture and online learning, it's hard to justify its current valuation that probably only compares to that of $SHOP or $OKTA.\n\nAgain, I could be 100% wrong, but I don't think Zoom stands a chance against the big tech like Google and Microsoft. Those are diversified monopoly companies that could push Zoom out of the video conferencing space, especially with the help of government intervention from the US and EU. Zoom may still find a market in Asia, possibly Russia and Africa, but I believe its prospects in the Western world are rather grim.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Liquidity on /NQ is non-existent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is this happening?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarket isn't willing or able to short or sell /NQ futures anymore. There isn't a single reason for that, it's a multitude of factors such as: shorts that shorted the March lows got blown the fuck up, others are fucking broke, big boys can't hedge shorting /NQ very well anymore, some drank the kool-aid and went full \"stonks only go up\" again, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does this mean?**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

But they also hold a fuckton more notional in swaps. And you know what happens when the funds buy swap contracts from the big banks? The banks in turn go out and hedge all or most of the position by buying or selling futures. SQQQ, QID and PSQ in turn hold short positions. Estimating an approximate net positioning across all these funds looks like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Date|Futures contracts held|Total futures equivalent|1-day change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|06/03|\\+3670|\\+66534|\\+605|\n|06/02|\\+4335|\\+65929|\\+1388|\n|06/01|\\+3755|\\+64540|\\-|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, out of 208,571 OI on /NQM20, these lev. funds alone keep long 66,534. Almost 32% of the OI is in these garbage ass funds. On 6/2 at 3:50, these things bought about 1.4k contracts, hence the retarded spike. Yesterday, at 3:50pm, they bought about 600 contracts, hence the retarded spike. But right after, UVXY, TVIX and the rest of the long vol funds came in and bought a fuckton of VIX futures, which dunked everything back down. \n\nUVXY:\n\n|Holding|Contracts 6/2|Exposure 6/2|Contracts 6/3|Exposure 6/3|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CBOE VIX FUTURE Jul20 |12776|383599400|16509|479999175 |\n|CBOE VIX FUTURE Jun20 |14196|400682100|14855 |401085000 |\n|IPATH SERIES-B S&amp;P 500 VIX SHT-TERM FUT SWAP - GS |1542183.61|49931725.84|1542183.606 |48050940.41 |\n|Cash||555951374.59||618918110.14 |\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou'll notice 2 things:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A fuckton of cash coming in long vol\n* Futures weight shifting from June futures towards July futures. And this, motherfuckers, **is very important.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's important due to its effects on the VIX. As VIX futures get bought, the short side will be hedging them via short SPX exposure. The VIX is calculated from SPX options with more than 23 days and less than 37 days to expiration. See:\n\n[https://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf](https://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat means June VIX futures are hedged via SPX June short positioning, which is also reflected in the options. But starting with 5/27, those 6/19 positions that hedge VIX Jun futures slip out of the calculation for the VIX itself, hence vol started shredding at that point just for this stupid-ass reason. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now,  money is finally pouring back into long volatility AND VIX etfs started rolling to the July futures. This means that July SPX will be hammered down, and those expirations ARE included in the VIX calculation, which is going to move the VIX higher and the market lower. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd guess what, we're also in a short squeeze on volatility. TVIX &amp; UVXY short fees are over 5%, and almost no shortable shares available anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of that, all these garbage-ass long leveraged etfs have to start rolling those June /NQ futures soon, and they're not going to be able to roll those huge amounts in this dogshit liquidity =&gt; TQQQpocalypse again. Short interest on TQQQ is going up big as well.\n\nSee expiration and roll dates:\n\n[https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/rolldates.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/rolldates.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, what you want to do is this:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dump every-god-damn-long except long volatility\n* Long VIX 7/7 &amp; 7/21 calls @ 60 strike\n* Long TQQQ way OTM puts for every god damn expiration from 6/12 to 7/21.\n* If ya played the akimbo, close the put spreads, should be a 2-3x right now, ride the other positions for free.\n* For the love of god, if you don't want to go short, at least move to cash. You can move back in after the 1st week of July, if market's still intact. But fuck me who am I kidding you guys are greedy assholes, see you in a couple of weeks when you'll be shitposting about \"cLoSing thE mArkEtS\" again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd if you want to be cocky ass retards, how about you inverse this and post some screenshots. **I double-dare you, motherfuckers**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: If you're holding ZM puts (exp. next week or later, this week's probably fucked) you want to keep those. You retards think that was bullish action yesterday on ZM? It was shorted so hard on open that it went straight into a short squeeze, just on IBKR over 300k shares were shorted in the first minutes all the way to no shortable shares available. That was a market hatefuck like I've never seen before. \n\nPPS: Zoom sucks, blow me.\n\nTLDR: Short every-fucking-thing-except-the-vix-and-especially-tqqq.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, retards.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Simple. Buy Pfizer calls. 7/17 38c is my position. \n\nIf you don't read the news you might not know that Trump has shortlisted Pfizer, JNJ, Merck, MRNA, AZN for operation warp speed (NYT article)\n\nPfizer is a great play, they will be releasing Phase 1/2 data by the end of the month and are collaborating with BNTX. \n\nThey are incidentally doing the largest vaccine trial involving 18-80 age group (looking at you INO) and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China). \n\nPfizer are so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates. Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial. \n\nWhile BNTX being the junior partner would potentially get a greater share of the gains, a quick glance at BNTX calls shows really really fucking high IV, whereas Pfizer calls are in the 20s% as I write this.  BNTX options are also manipulated to shit and I know this from personal experience. \n\nAnother reason why Pfizer? Because they are oversold following a Phase 3 drug trial fail at start of week. Irrelevant for our play.\n\nI think we all know by now that pharma pumps hard off good data and thats what we are hoping for. Given Pfizer had a few billion in their market cap wiped off recently I am sure they will use this oppurtunity to retrace back to 38 and potentially beyond (my personal price target is 40+)\n\nThis is a set and forget play. \n\nJune 19 have good liquidity if you are really bullish on them (risk they wont publish data before then?), July is also a good bet along with Septembers. \n\nRecommended: **38c/40c 7/17, or go long on 40c 18/9**\n\nPositions: https://imgur.com/a/uKTQ8B9\n\nAs always this isn't investment advice. Please do your own DD and assess the risks. I evaluated that this is a low risk play compared to other vaccine plays out there!",

Buy PRPL calls.   New higher strikes are now available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't post links or pictures, so this will be brief.   Check my post history for the last three posts I made on PRPL if you want full DD.   I'm going to write this for those following the stock who have read those.  I did have a diagram made for all of this too...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Underwriter Exercise of Secondary Offering Option\n\nOn Monday, Purple \"announced that the underwriters of its previously announced underwritten secondary public offering have exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 1,618,405 shares of its Class A common stock\".\n\nThis was fully expected as the Underwriters got the option to buy 1.6M shares at only $10.50 as a result of running the book on the secondary offering.   Remember, that this offering was just founders selling shares, so it was non-dilutionary, as is this exercise.\n\nThe underwriters are in the business of making transactions occur, not determining whether to invest in the company itself, so my hypothesis on the trading behavior today and unexpected volume is that the underwriters are just cashing in their shares they got.\n\n***This artificially depresses the price, but creates a great buying opportunity today/tomorrow.***   Volume was just over a million shares today, which is much higher than the last week or so of volume by far.\n\nIf you go look at a 6-month chart, you will notice that 12/17/2019 was the very beginning of a nice run up after the last secondary offering for PRPL.   This was also the date of the last exercise notice and the last time the downward pressure was relieved on the stock that comes from a secondary offering.\n\nMonday, with the announcement of the exercise, today with the cashing in of shares, and likely tomorrow with remaining shares being exited also ***represents the end of significant downward pressure on the stock during the secondary offering period.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to reiterate my $19 price target by 8/12 earnings and that the stock should be trading at $20-$24 right now.   ***Today and tomorrow represent a great entry point if you are looking for one.***   I'm expecting the run up of 1-4% per day to continue until we reach the price range mentioned earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy apologies for being a day late on this call out, but life has been busy.\n\nI'm long 521,400 PRPLW warrants, 301 shares of PRPL, 30x 15c 6/19 and 10x 15c 10/16.

Some notes:\n\n* You could play down to 296p, challenge is if we don't move with velocity, you'll be stuck in a position with less interest, that takes far more movement to push price, higher risk\n* I'll be playing higher, likely in the 303 to 306 range\n* I favor the 6/10 strike, as I expect all movement by Mon-Tues, and might be out by Friday.  6/12 is also an option, as is 6/8 for the high risk lotto plays.\n\n# Why\n\nI base this play on the oscillators and MACD indicators, among other TA.  Some notes:\n\n* ES 3h oscillator has pushed above 52 now for the 4th time\n* SPY 3h oscillator is also forming a 4th top, the first blew off 2.91 points, the second blew off 2.83, the third blew of 6.81, this fourth peak should exceed the third in both duration and depth\n* Playing the downside is harder, it will move quick when it does\n* Velocity can increase when we're this overbought, meaning we can pop upwards from here, 316 forms the upper range of current targets, and I expect a quick snap down of around 12 points.  I don't think we hit 316 before plunging, we could fail our 309 test and drop.  The higher we climb, the nastier the initial fall.\n* MACD has not crossed over, it's a reliable indicator, though lagging, so I try to guess ahead\n* 3h oscillator looks like it wants to flash sell, though hasn't yet.  At these levels, it's a reliable indicator, slightly less lagging than MACD, but also more prone to fakeouts\n* On ES, 1d oscillator is at highest level since Jan 24, 4h at highest since Apr 30th, 2h is oversold flashing sell, 1h flashed sell during AH and is about to have a MACD crossover\n\n[https://imgur.com/QMQYDAj](https://imgur.com/QMQYDAj)\n\n# So what to do\n\nFor now, don't do anything.  It's too early, literally and figuratively, to enter.  We've started a trend of rising overnight and selling into open.  We might do the same today.  The only way I consider entering at open is if we sell out under 3080, we're at 3091 now.  Rather I know I'm going to play this, and will be searching for an entry.  I expect to enter today, but that's not a guarantee.  \n\nIf you'd like to play along, or even just watch and laugh as my money does a vanishing act, you're welcome to.  This isn't a good day for me, numerous real life aspects pulling me away, but I will do my best.\n\nAs always, I'll be transparent about my positions, including date, contracts, average, and movement.  Will share TA I'm watching as well.  I expect an initial buy of around $1000-$2000, might double or triple position as averaging dictates.\n\n**Side note:** I don't believe this is a further leg down, this is a healthy reset to burn off steam on a strong upward climb.",

        "selftext": "## What is UNFI Food?\n\nUnited Natural Foods (UNFI) is a food wholesaler. They are currently best known as the [supplier to WholeFoods](https://www.refrigeratedtransporter.com/foodservice/grocery/article/21712244/unfi-extends-distribution-agreement-with-whole-foods) and is one of the largest food distributors in America.\n\n## How the coronavirus plays in\n\nGrocery spending is higher, [up 27% from this same point last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/shoppers-shift-from-stockpiling-to-penny-pinching-at-the-grocery-store.html). Online groceries have skyrocketted as well, projected to [increase by 40%](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/online-grocery-sales-grow-40-2020) in 2020. The growth in online grocery sales is obviously the result of COVID with 52% of consumers polled stating that 2020 was the first time they had purchased groceries online; note the massive spike in [APRN](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/APRN). Let's also not forget about lower fuel costs and higher food inflation, which increased [2.6% in one month, or 4.1% for 12 months so far](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), for \"food at home\" category. This obviously benefits UNFI further. In addition to this, UNFI will benefit from the [CARES act](https://www.waste360.com/food-waste/keeping-food-table-pandemic) via increased deductibility of interest expenses, potential for tax loss carrybacks to prior years (at a higher, 35% tax rate) and faster depreciation of improvements. The exact amount is hard to estimate, but it will be just icing on the cake. The cake is described below.\n\n## Earnings\n\nEarnings is [June 10th](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/unfi). What's interesting is that this company were so excited to release their earnings, they put out a [preliminary report](https://ir.unfi.com/news/press-release-details/2020/United-Natural-Foods-Announces-Preliminary-Third-Quarter-Results-and-Provides-COVID-19-Business-Update/default.aspx) and they absolutely hit it right outta the park. Adjusted earnings per share was up 130% from 61 cents during the same time last year. Revenue for the quarter comes in 12% higher than the $5.96 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. They also reported a net income of 88 million a 57% increase from the same period last year. **The company pulled their 2020 guidance since they said they already hit it and they\u2019ll update it when earnings come out.** These guys did their ENTIRE year of projected earnings in ONE QUARTER. They used this to pay off massive amounts of debt and even sold off some stuff that they can use to pay debt down further. As a result of this preliminary report, the stock price popped to $22ish and has now dropped a little since. When the updated earnings report comes in, I expect the stock to really pop. But since it won't be for another 13 days, we can play off the earnings run-up as well as more investors buy in with anticipation. A lot of people are going to say the news is already priced in due to the preliminary being released, but it really isn't. Updated guidance for 2020 should be announced at earnings and this will be the catalyst for movement. Last reported short percentage is 18% of float, so this could put a hurt on the shorts when guidance comes out. \n\n## Previous Highs\n\nThe [stock traded at high 40s](https://i.imgur.com/aH4Spts.png) back in 2018 and has been getting shit on since down in the teens. But right now, everything about this stock shows it\u2019s going to continue upward and the full earnings report will be the catalyst. In 2018, the company [bought SuperValu](https://ir.unfi.com/unfi-acquires-supervalu/default.aspx) to expand into conventional grocery, increase scale, realize synergies and, likely, diversify away from reliance on Whole Foods. A large part of this massive drop from high 40s was due to investors thinking this decision was trash. For a while it seemed that SuperValu acquisition was an expensive mistake as there were delays, extra expenses and customer service issues. Well jokes on them because it ended up working out and now it\u2019s paying off in spades. This acquisition gave the company a leg-up from other competitors who are struggling from coivd19-related supply chain issues, as UNFI can easily reach all of their retail partners quickly with 58 locations.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nSkip this part if you're not super into the technical details. While the expected GAAP ([generally accepted accounting principles](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/GAAP-generally-accepted-accounting-principles) earnings per share and net income are already impressive, it is actual free cash flow that matters most. It is especially true for UNFI, since they need to reduce debt and move from around 5x leverage to the target they have of under 3x. The free cash flow, or FCF, is significantly greater than net income for the following reasons.\n\nThe company made a 338g tax election, which allows it to depreciate acquired SUPERVALU assets accounting them at a high tax base, resulting in high depreciation non-cash charges, much greater than ongoing CapEx. Depreciation appears to be running $30 million less than CapEx per quarter, or $120 million annualized.\n\nAt $30 million per quarter or $120 million  a year, the difference between D&amp;A and CapEx contributes another $2.24 per share in free cash flow. The end result is $426 million in annual adjusted FCF or $7.96 per share. Assuming the cash flow goes to debt reduction, the annual interest expense gets reduced by $25 million a year, improving net profit by $20 million and increasing EPS by $0.37.

If I change my mind, I'll be putting edits at the bottom of this post like I did with my previous DD's. This stock was given a price target of [$22, raised from $10](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+PT+Change/United+Natural+Foods+%28UNFI%29+PT+Raised+to+%2422+at+BMO+Capital/16889479.html) by BMO Capital analyst Kelly Bania about 2 weeks ago, but I think it'll go higher. There are some analysts that claim it can go back to last year's valuation of $40 per share long term, so holding shares of this stock wouldn't hurt either.\n\nAlso shoutout to /u/theodros1 who posted DD on this a week ago but only got like 16 upvotes. \n\ntl;dr I'm buying $22.5c 6/19",

        "selftext": "Alright, ZM is on that retard running exercise program again. Looks like scalpers looking for a quick buck before earnings. This stock looks like it\u2019s exactly higher lows for the last 3 months but it\u2019s all driven by hype and disillusionment.\n\nHere\u2019s what I know. Most people aren\u2019t a paid subscriber. For example, from the info I\u2019ve collected so far, 18/20 school districts that I had contact with are not on a paid plan. In fact, three of the local school districts in my area in the East Bay held fiscal meetings on Zoom, but they would tell everyone in the beginning of the meeting that there is a 45 minute limit and the meeting will close - that we would have to wait for another think to rejoin. That\u2019s basically another way of saying, we ain\u2019t paying for this shit. We on that free free. \n\nOn the topic of education, tutoring is a big income stream for ZM. A lot of tutors hosting 1-2 hour lessons actually pay for the professional option. My son and daughter\u2019s tutors can host Zoom lessons for 2 hours without interruption for that reason. But just recently, both tutors are saying that they are preferring to meet in person now so save the cost of doing Zoom lessons. They said most tutors are returning in person lessons and that it should be safe to do so. So, there you have it. Another sector that is breaking off from Zoom. \n\nFor tech businesses which I\u2019m directly associated with, some do pay for zoom and others don\u2019t. Had a 2.5 hour conference with a partnering tech company a week ago and they had us rejoin with a new link twice. You would think a tech company would just buy a professional account if not better to host meetings, but no. For my company, I know that our plan is set to be canceled by end of June since people are heading back to work. \n\nMoreover, let\u2019s take a look at ZM vs competitors. \nSkype fucked it up. Their one big moment and they busted too early. Google Meets/Hangouts has an incredibly simple UI and extended functions that work with Google\u2019s numerous applications. Cisco webex, Google Hangouts, Jitsi Meet, Slack, Microsoft Teams to name a few are all doing virtually the same things. Nothing novel about ZM other than the frequent security issues. \n\nCompany is currently valued at 57B where 3 months ago it was worth around 10B. The shelter in place was great, but it\u2019s about time ZM gets a big correction. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this dips below $100 by July.",

        "selftext": "If you sell your holdings to buy back in at a lower level, you have to be right twice. You have to be right about that decision to sell and your future decision to buy back in.\n\nPeople will say \"you just need to buy back in at a lower cost.\" But it's really not that simple. Unless the market plays out to your plan perfectly, you will always be at the mercy of human psychology and will likely lose money in the long run.\n\nTake a look at threads when SPY was at 290. People were proudly saying left and right that they have liquidated their portfolio and will buy back in when the market seems less irrational.. And that they are ok with missing out future gains.\n\nWhat do you think those people are doing right now? I bet you that 50% of them have already bought back in at the higher price because their mind was yelling \"if you dont get in now, you will never get back in.\" The other 50% are watching the market very closely and banging their desk every time SPY ticks upwards..\n\nAnd let's say... They were right! SPY will dip back to 250. The remaiming 50% of people I talked about were technically right about their decision to sell. But the drop won't happen overnight. It will be a multiple days or weeks process. \n\n15% of people will actually buy back in when SPY retreats to 290 and lingers there for a few days... They will be mentally scarred after seeing SPY shoot above 300 and their only wish is to get back into the market and get rid of this stress. So at any opportunity they see, they will jump back in despite their original cost being 270.\n\n\nThe remaining 35% people will now breathe a sigh of relief as they watch SPY dip below their original selling price of 270.. When SPY hits 260, another 10% of people will buy back in.. All that stress and risk of forever being out of the market all for a 4% gain..\n\nWhen SPY hits 250, another 10% of people will buy back in. Ok good job your timing paid off.\n\nBut how about the remaining 15%? They were waiting for SPY to hit 240... But lets say 250 was the new bottom and SPY sloely climbs back up.\n\nHalf of those people (7.5%) will watch the market go back up to 280 and buy back in after giving up. The other half will never buy back in because psychology wont allow them.\n\nThese are the scenarios that are likely to happen when you try to time the market. I say this as someone who has experienced all of the aboove during my attempt at timing the market.\n\nIf your time period is 10+ years, then the risk of selling to buy back in at a lower price is far greater than the 10% gain you might achieve by doing so... Even if the market crashes 30% again, the average investor is better off just ignoring the noise and staying in the game to guarantee that they can leap the long-term benefit of investing... Because thats where the magic really happens. \n\n15 years from now it wont matter much if you made your initial purchase of SPY at 300 vs. 270. But what will matter is if you somehow got burned at trying to time the market and never got back in...",

Not thoroughly fleshed out b/c you autists have limited attention spans, but a summary. Figured I\u2019d take the time to give back to this community that has provided many lolz, &amp; should be a good measuring stick when evaluating other forms of fundamental DD posted here. \n\nNFA.\n\n**DKNG** \\- DraftKings, Inc.: vertically integrated US mobile betting operator that also provides retail sports betting &amp; back-end betting solutions through SBTech. Think of SBTech as the tech \u2018market-maker\u2019 for traditional sports betting, they do all the funny math to set the betting odds &amp; seem to be working on back-end solutions for DKNG Casino \n\n***The Big Picture***\n\n* Total annual US Gambling Revenue: \\~$90Bn \\[1\\]\n   * Casinos: \\~$75Bn\n   * Illegal Sports Betting: \\~$13Bn\n   * Horse Racing: \\~$0.8Bn\n   * Daily Fantasy Sports: \\~$0.4Bn\n\nOnly \\~2% of the \\~$90Bn gambling revenues were placed online which is the lowest in the world where betting online is legal. For example, in other countries online gaming activity represents \\~6% - \\~52% of total gambling revenues, with \\~12% being the average. \n\nWall Street expects online gaming revenue to be $20Bn-$40Bn within the next 10 years. For this to be achieved, the online gambling market will have to achieve a \\~30% penetration rate on total country gaming revenues. There is an expectation that this is could be easily achievable given penetration trends overseas - see page 11 of this: [https://s1.rationalcdn.com/vendors/stars-group/documents/presentations/TSG-Investor-Day\\_March-27-2019.pdf](https://s1.rationalcdn.com/vendors/stars-group/documents/presentations/TSG-Investor-Day_March-27-2019.pdf) \n\nOther catalysts include increasing adaptation of sports betting in more states. States that have both legal sports betting + online sports betting permitted: NV, NJ, WV, PA, IA. Sports betting permitted but no online: DE, MS, RI, MO, AR. Prior to COVID there was ongoing discussions across many States, especially ones with growing deficits to explore how permitting sports betting could create a fresh avenue of tax dollars. Post COVID there is an expectation that these discussions will be given extra focus as many States will be hungry for incremental tax dollars. **Important to note that currently 43/50 States allow DFS, but given the small share DFS has on total Gaming Revenues, it increasingly looks like DKNG is banking on traditional sports betting for a variety of reasons, more later.** There are entire articles on Google arguing this catalyst so I\u2019ll end this here. \n\n***Digging Deeper***\n\nDKNG\u2019s main offerings are Daily Fantasy Sports (\u201cDFS\u201d) products &amp; traditional sports book products to its clients. Long story short, a metric to look for in my opinion (that is curiously not reported by management or remarked on) is the hold % in traditional gaming sector parlance or the \u2018rake\u2019 &amp; compare it to the \u2018traditional\u2019 gaming products like sports betting &amp; Blackjack. \n\nFor DFS: DKNG takes \\~15% of the prize pool (note: used to be \\~6-11% \\[2\\]). Curiously, their main competitor FanDuel also has moved up to a \\~15% rake recently. Google searches show the smaller competitors have a rake in the \\~13% range. \n\nThis \u2018rake\u2019 has grown \\~2x in 6 years, but it has been a delicate move on behalf of management. Why? B/c the more \u2018sophisticated\u2019 DFS players (equal to autistic day traders on Robinhood) have noted this increase &amp; based on some Googling, some have moved down market to the smaller players. As a side note, many live casino games have their rules altered to grow the Hold %. For example, Blackjack games with 6:5 payouts on 21 have materially higher Hold % than the traditional BJ rules that pay out 3:2. Given the findings so far, DKNG may not have much room to materially increase its hold % in DFS games in the near-term from current of 15%. More on this later. \n\nNow why the fuck is this important? This is important b/c the typical sports book (ex-Parlays) have a \\~5% hold %/rake. Parlays have up to a \\~30% hold (which is why it\u2019s commonly known as the sucker\u2019s bet), &amp; just for reference, the average Blackjack table clocks in 14.5%. What this means: Every dollar put into these games, the \u201cHouse\u201d or DKNG, will take 15% of your money for DFS games, for sports bets they will be pocketing \\~5%, up to \\~30% if you\u2019re into parlays, &amp; we\u2019ll just use the standard 14.5% BJ hold for the DraftKings Casino platform. \n\nSo why the acquisition of SBTech &amp; a foray into the traditional sports gambling market? As you can see previously, the illegal sports betting market is **&gt;30x** the size of the current daily fantasy sports market. So it\u2019s clear that the DFS providers including DKNG are foraying into the space to capture this user base &amp; hopefully convert them into games that have a higher hold %, such as DFS/DKNG Casino. \n\nAs of May 2020, DKNG has achieved a 30% penetration rate on its \\~4mm \u2018monetized\u2019 DFS clientele to its Online Sports Book (OSB), from the OSB+DFS clientele, DKNG has converted 50% into its DraftKings Casino platform. \n\nIncluding non-monetized users, user base totals at 12mm. Based on these unit economics: every 1mm of additional users -&gt; 333k monetized users for DFS -&gt; 100k users for OSB -&gt; 50k users for DraftKings Casino.  \n\n***Some Numbers \u2013 Italicized/Bolded the important***\n\n* In total, DKNG has DFS paying clientele of \\~4mm, the metric management focuses on is \u201cMonthly Unique Payers (MUP)\u201d which spans across DFS &amp; online sports betting***. As of Q1\u201920 they reported 720,000*** MUPs, representing +16% YoY growth \\[3\\]\n   * Average revenue per monthly user (ARPU) of ***\\~$41***, +11% YoY\n      * Based on previous observation of Hold %, looks like ARPU growth will be limited\n   * **Since \u201917, MUP has grown at a \\~11% CAGR &amp; ARPU has grown at a \\~19% CAGR**\n   * As a side note: the \\~4mm monetized user base was acquired at \\~$122/user over 3 years. Total users cost them $41/user over the last 3 years \\[3\\].\n* They are currently EBITDA negative &amp; Wall St expects them to be positive by 2023\n   * I took a dive into the math driving this, here is a summary:\n      * **Based on their current cost structure they will need to have \\~1.7mm MUPs at an        ARPU of \\~$46 to break-even. This implies total monetized users of \\~10mm from \\~4mm currently**\n\n***Numbers that represent Risks to Long Thesis***\n\n* DKNG\u2019s user base of \\~12mm is on the low end of the sector vs. its \u2018brick &amp; mortar\u2019 competitor's user bases (online betting platforms with physical casino presence) \n   * CZR with 55mm, MGM with 33mm, ERI with 10mm (in pending merger with CZR, could have a lot of overlap), FanDuel with 8.5mm\n   * Is there a concern for increased marketing costs to increase user base? Let\u2019s look at a case study of NJ, the first state to open both mobile &amp; retail sports betting:\n      * FanDuel + DraftKings have held 80%+ of the OSB market share since 12/2018 which is estimated to be driven by the conversion opportunity from DFS that is unique to both companies \\[4\\] \n      * On the flipside, a case study to examine going forward is how DKNG can get OSB customers in a State that does not allow DFS. Nevada. Home to Las fucking Vegas. Prior to NV pushing FanDuel/DKNG out (highly likely due to casino lobbying), NV was a top-15 State in terms of revenue for them. NV is home to the fattest sports book in the US, &amp; recently the gaming commission started to parse the data on sportsbook wagers done online vs. in-person, &amp; it came out to roughly 50/50. It will be interesting to see how they try to capture market share in a state with no DFS \n* Long-term EBITDA margin target of 35% requires huge growth in MUPs\n   * Based on their estimated '22 cost structure: Holding ARPU of \\~$46, MUPs will have to be \\~5.2mm, a 7x increase from current to achieve a EBITDA margin of 35%\n      * A focus on future earnings will be management's ability to shift to a more fixed-cost structure which would effectively lower the MUP requirement for profitability\n\n***Things to look for when going Long***\n\n\\- Progress of additional States legalizing sports betting \u2013 specifically, States with DFS already legalized\n\n\\- Cost structure evolving to a more fixed mix vs. the mostly variable mix currently as this will be the forward figure that determines profitability\n\n\\- Increasing User Base (Curr.: 12mm) -&gt; Monetized Base (Curr.: 4mm) -&gt; MUP (1Q\u201920: 0.7mm)\n\n* Management seems to be focused more on the first step, but one thing to note is that the 33% monetization rate is very high when compared to something like League of Legends which isn\u2019t entirely comparable but in 2013 had a \\~4% monetization rate \\[5\\]. This, combined with the below implies that this conversion rate may be the ceiling for now\n* As a side note, \\~6 years ago FanDuel had \\~300k monetized on an \\~800k user base for a monetization rate of \\~37% \\[6\\]  \n\n***Share Price Target***\n\nGiven the cost structure of the company, I\u2019m going to base the price targets around Enterprise Value / Revenues (driven by MUPs &amp; ARPUs). \n\n* MAU sensitivity of 5mm - 6mm\n* ARPU sensitivity from $41 - $47 for an average of $44, just a $3 increase from current of $41. \n* Share Price targets based on 2.0x - 4.5x EV / Sales.\n   * Note: Flutter Entertainment (FanDuel ParentCo) trades at \\~3.6x EV/Sales\n\n**Bear Case MAU: 5mm -&gt; $20.32 - $45.73**\n\n**Base Case MAU: 5.5mm -&gt; $22.27 - $50.10**\n\n**Bull Case MAU: 6mm -&gt; $24.21 - $54.47**\n\nThese MAUs imply a monetized customer base of 28mm \u2013 33mm. At the high-end, this implies that DKNG monetized customer base will equal MGM\u2019s current total user base. \n\nAt yesterday\u2019s close of $43.70, DKNG is trading at 3.5x \u2013 4.5x forward Revenues on an expected &gt;5,000 MAUs. \n\nShare Price drivers / considerations: \n\n\\- Continued multiple expansion \n\n* Consideration: A 1x premium to FanDuel's 3.6x, implies a \\~15% upside to current. They're bigger than FanDuel, do they deserve the premium?\n\n\\- MAU Growth exceeding targets\n\n* Consideration: Stock currently implies that they should on average be growing at 40% QoQ \u2013 during 2018 they had on average +30% growth QoQ in MAUs, marking their best year\n\n***Management Team***\n\nJason Robins, 39 \u2013 Co-Founder &amp; CEO. Duke BA, started DraftKings from day 1 in 2011. The 2 other buddies he started the Company with are still at DKNG. Dude navigated the Company through the scandal that rocked them in \u201915 &amp; \u201916, and was the trailblazer in getting DFS labeled as a non-gambling product that enabled it to open in States without a gaming designation. This shit is the stuff that gets people in history books. His accomplishments make him seem like a very competent guy. Has 3 kids now, and only \\~3% economic ownership in DKNG but has 90% of the voting power through his Class B share ownership. Also he actively participates in venture investments, sitting on 10 boards. \n\nHis comp plan performance bonus target is pretty murky, but main drivers are EPS growth, revenue growth, then a bunch of margin &amp; return metrics, along with share price returns. Overall, very open-ended &amp; it\u2019s safe to say as long as shit doesn\u2019t hit the fan, he will be eligible for his max payouts year over year. I\u2019m assuming the lawyers tried to encompass everything possible for maximum flexibility to justify him earning his max comp as long as DKNG is still around. \n\nSince he\u2019s got voting control of 90%, I\u2019ll end the specific-person overview here, but want to note that they have a very bloated C-suite. 12 folks at DKNG, 8 folks at SBTech, all with C-suite designations. Whereas their main competitor FanDuel, has 3 guys with a C-suite designations &amp; 1 EVP, but is a sub under a larger ParentCo that has its own management team of \\~5 guys. \n\nLooking through glassdoor you can see the biggest complaint among employees giving bad reviews is based on management, all of the specific issues they point out IMO are a result of a top-heavy company. Seems like a good starting point to optimize their cost structure, but given Robins' history of sticking this entire thing through with his co-founders since '11 stuff like this doesn't seem to be a part of his playbook. They\u2019re a public company now though, so it\u2019s going to be interesting to see going forward.  \n\nTL;DR:\n\nIf I were to initiate a position in DKNG, the stock would have to fall to the $35-$37 range for me to be a buyer of the stock, and based on this rough intro analysis I'll be considering Put options if it breaches $50. I would not touch Calls at this level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\] Susquehanna Research \u2013 U.S. Online Gambling 6/27/19\n\n\\[2\\] [https://rotogrinders.com/articles/bang-for-your-buck-a-look-at-dfs-industry-rake-153302](https://rotogrinders.com/articles/bang-for-your-buck-a-look-at-dfs-industry-rake-153302) \n\n\\[3\\] [https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/static-files/8f3a5c5a-7228-45bf-aab2-63604111c48d](https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/static-files/8f3a5c5a-7228-45bf-aab2-63604111c48d) \n\n\\[4\\] Goldman Sachs Research \u2013 DKNG Initiation 5/19/20\n\n\\[5\\][https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/223071/Dont\\_monetize\\_like\\_League\\_of\\_Legends\\_consultant\\_says.php](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/223071/Dont_monetize_like_League_of_Legends_consultant_says.php)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://rotogrinders.com/threads/how-many-people-actually-play-dfs-regularly-252044](https://rotogrinders.com/threads/how-many-people-actually-play-dfs-regularly-252044)",

It's not too late to jump in, if you don't you are making a grave mistake if you think this is a write-off sector like most foolish and Robinhood-level investors.\n\nHere are  tickers as of 12PM EST of big mall stocks and their performance:\n\n**$SPG: up 14.7%!**\n\n**$SITC: up 14.66%!**\n\n**$MAC: up 12.7%!**\n\n**$KRG: up 11.94%**\n\n**$KIM: up 10.78%**\n\n**$SKT: up 10.33%!**\n\n**$REG: up 8.43%!**\n\n**The top 7 mall holding companies in America are now soaring bigger** than ever before for the following reasons, and we are now entering the recovery phase so you are running out of time.\n\n1. Among the top 7 mall holding companies, several of them have partnered up to collude on ventures to raise capital and more partnerships are on the way. Meaning that they are supporting amongst themselves.\n2. As other mall holding companies are worth pennies or nearing shutdown **the top 7 are buying up or attempting to close deals on buying up many of the smaller mall holding companies.**  One example is that Taubman's deal with Simon Property is still in the green, and Simon will continue with the buyout. Mac is about to buy many smaller internet companies for their retail brandbox idea.\n3. This delusion that ***people will be \"scared\" to go to malls is now (confirmed) bullshit.*** As people have been waiting in line to go to stores inside the bigger malls and have been gradually increasing in traffic for smaller once. Many bigger malls are also places to \"hang-out\" and malls being among the first shopping centers top open, will have the advantage on being a \"hang-out spot\" as other \"public places\" still remain closed in many cities across the country.\n4. Many of the top 7 indoor and outdoor mall/shopping center holders **CONTINUE TO SEE jumps just on announcements of potentially opening up MORE locations across several states.** Hopium is a real drug and it will continue to raise the stock prices of major malls.\n5. Mall tenants are working with malls to expand advertising to get crowds to the malls as much as possible to make up losses and it's working!\n6. Many people need haircuts, new shoes, clothes, suits, entertainment to distract them like games, movies, soundbars, headphones, etc. **The malls will be the FIRST in line to offer every day distractions and essentials** to the people, since the top 7 mall holding companies are ***going to open before many of your street strips will***. While also having social interaction, and a closed (or open if it's outdoor) space to \"hang out\" in and \"relax\", and that's important.\n\nBy betting against the malls you are basically doing the same as putting in $200 puts on Chipotle or $800 calls on Luckin Coffee. AKA, that ***Doesn't make ANY sense.***\n\nMalls have cheap premiums for calls (for now) and aren't usually volatile once things become balanced (SPG being a common exception) so if you want to get in on the Big Mall Victory Shaped recovery you are running out of time because a lot of the recovery will be done by the end of this month.\n\n***Jump in on big malls now!***\n\nMAC $10C, KITE $13C, SKT $9C, REG $51C,  SPG $82C.",

        "selftext": "##AVCT\n\nThis is a neat one, very excited to find this and post about it here.\n\nThere's very little discussion out there on AVCT.  They've never been mentioned on /r/SPACs before today.  They've flown completely under the radar as far as I can tell.  It seems like the stock IPO sort of tanked because the Holding company went to market without the merger being completely finished.  They rebranded to AVCT, but they didn't really have a core product ready yet.  People seem to have assumed the stock was vaporware and sold off.  They had a couple quarters of 0 revenue, stock tanked, since then everyone seems to have forgotten about them, even though it has only been 4 months.\n\nBut, then they merged with Computex, which is their core product --  Computex is now being renamed to AVCT.  So, Computex is the company to read up on if you want to know what AVCT is worth.  From what I can tell, Computex seems... totally legit.\n\nThey are actively posting jobs:\n\nhttps://computex.net/careers/\n\n&gt;US-TX-Houston\n\n&gt;Posted Date 2 days ago(6/1/2020 8:20 AM)\n\n&gt;**Job Title Principal Engineer, Infrastructure Services (Microsoft Technologies)**\n\n&gt;An established 30+ year-old yet growing $150M+ technology company, with 200 employees in multiple states, is seeking a senior level Data Center Engineer in our Network Operations Center (NOC) in Houston, TX. This is a Tier 3 level resource with specialized knowledge and experience in Microsoft Technologies, Azure, Office 365, Messaging Technologies, Virtualization and Core Infrastructure Services. This position will work closely with our Principal Engineers and Infrastructure Team to maintain, update and introduce new functionality to the existing environment. This person will also assist in supporting the Windows server environment and other server/storage infrastructure projects will be assigned as needed.   At Computex, our Guiding Principles are simple, but critical to maintaining our incredible culture and our daily endeavor for excellence in everything we do. o Delight our Customers o Develop a Fun &amp; Creative Workplace o Provide Value to our Shareholders   The ideal candidate also believes in these core guiding principles and mission.\n\n&gt;Job ID 2020-1072\n\nI work in IT, and everything in the job posting is perfectly valid.  Computex seems to be a nice, $150M+ business with like 200 employees.\n\nThey have employees listed on LinkedIn, around 190 profiles, which aligns with all of their claims in the job post.  The employee profiles are solid and they have real experience.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-burbach-14ba923/ - Worked for IBM for 11 years..\n\nExecutive team seems solid.  Their first earnings are about to come out on 6/14.\n\nIt's a real cloud company, by all indications around 80% undervalued, **for $0.09 a warrant.**\n\nThe ONLY way a SPAC should ever trade this low is if it's some sort of scam / malfeasance / etc. -- that doesn't seem to be the case here.

        "selftext": "TLDR: The numbers don't add up + 2021 guidance is complete garbage + standing firm on my previous prediction that ZM will correct 30% by mid June.\n\nReport Revenue: 328M\n\nReports that 88% of revenue comes from Enterprises, meaning 288M came from these businesses.\n\nReported Enterprise Users: 275,000\n\nThe Math:\n\nCost of enterprise plan - $19.99 per host/per month\n\nGiven that the 275,000 enterprise customers consist of companies with 10+ employees, lets say the ratio of host to employees is 1 host per 10 employees. Seems fair?\n\n Now lets assume that the average # of employees for these 275,000 accounts is 100 employees. Seems fair right? JPM Data for 2014 finds that 99% of American businesses are small businesses and 88% of that employs less than 20 employees. Based on my approximation of 100 employees on average, that would be 10 hosts per company or $199.90 per company/per month.\n\nSo, 275,000 accounts x $199.90 x 3 months for the quarter = \\~165M\n\n165M is pretty far off from 288M, no? Maybe they rounded up or something.\n\nBut wait, they also said 768 customers contribute 100K for a 12-month trailing revenue. So... that's an additional 76.8M in revenue. \n\n2 problems here: 1) they said these customers are not adjusted into the revenue since these are trailing (or extrapolated) numbers assuming they don't cancel their subscription. \n\n2) Even if we add the 76.8M, we are still short $46.2M.\n\nIf you're still following the math at this point, congrats!\n\nHere's the second part of this analysis and it has to do with it's outrageous guidance. Their CFO said they are estimating \"conservatively\" in their guidance, but they somehow suddenly doubled their forward 2021 guidance from $900M to $1.8B. Yes, you didn't read that wrong. $1.8B is their estimated 2021 \"conservative\" guidance. Does this remind you of any company that did this type of magic math when their underlying value increased by 200% in the month? Tilray anyone?\n\nWe are at a point where the peak pandemic is over and people can care less about getting infected at this point because their UI claims are running dry and they have to go back to work soon. Conveniently, Google hangouts/meets + Cisco Webex + Microsoft Teams among others are competing for their lion's share of this space. Here's the difference: They all have integrated technology that can link applications and they are also free. Teams and Google are also significantly safer from a security standpoint. Tech companies are also mainly using Teams. That leaves that 275,000 customers most likely small businesses with much fewer than 100 average employees. \n\nThe point is that Zoom will NEVER be able to hit 1.8B in revenue unless COVID-19 kills 1 million people overnight, Kim Jong Jun says he will be hosting his deathbed message on Zoom, a 5-year shelter in place is effective immediately, and they start pimping Zoom employees as escorts. \n\nThey are down in AH btw. Even after all that.",

        "selftext": "Hello again, \u2018tardos. I\u2019m back with another deep-value play\u2014and might I suggest that, this time, you learn to take profit. Additionally, I\u2019ve realized that (due to poor levels of reading comprehension) it\u2019s necessary to include in an easy-to follow summary early-on in the post. Today, we\u2019re looking at DXC, your tech support specialist\u2019s least favorite company! The post will go as follows, and, as always, ***TL;DR at bottom***:\n\n1. What is DXC?\n2. What is the DXC turnaround process like?\n3. Undervalued\n4. Catalysts For Growth\n5. Bear Case \n6. Smart Money\n7. The Play / TL;DR\n\n# 1. What is DXC?\n\nDXC Technology is a provider of IT services. It\u2019s a massive company, sitting at \\~120 on the Fortune 500, and with 20B in LTM revenues. It operates through two segments, Global Business Services (GBS) and Global Infrastructure Services (GIS). GBS includes \u201ctechnology solutions comprising enterprise, cloud application, and consulting services; application services; analytics services; business process services; and industry software and solutions.\u201d The GIS segment \u201cprovides cloud and platform services; workplace, mobility, and Internet of Things services; and security solutions.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, the above basically reads as a bunch of buzzwords that you don\u2019t care about. The important thing to realize is that many of DXC\u2019s specializations are absolute money-losers, some are stagnant, and some are highly promising. Essentially, any segment that has been doing well in the market overall (cloud security, analytics, etc.) is doing well, and the other segments are forgettable. Here\u2019s an example from their 2019 [annual investor presentation ](https://assets1.dxc.technology/investor_relations/downloads/DXC_Annual_Report_2019_10K_Final_v4.pdf)summarizing this effect (\u201cdigital\u201d essentially encapsulates SAAS solutions): \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3mbstdooh251.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67ab20f7d02175a5cbb953676c6f183a31c6bd12\n\nAnd this trend has continued throughout Covid-19 up until this quarter. Though, as with most companies we\u2019ve seen some Covid-related QoQ contraction, we are absolutely seeing growth in the \u201cAnalytics and Engineering\u201d and \u201cCloud and Security\u201d segments:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5fr5y9poh251.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed624cbc16017302b3b49c2f96d112e5d1d28b32\n\nIf you\u2019re too lazy to parse all that, basically just understand that DXC does the same things as the B2B IT segments of Accenture, Cognizant Group, Infosys, and CGI Inc. Now that you understand *what* DXC does, it\u2019s important to understand if they do it *well*. Unfortunately for clients and shareholders, DXC\u2019s non-SAAS services (and some of it\u2019s SAAS ones) are ***utterly shit***. I\u2019m going to expand on this for a while, but don\u2019t have a fweak out just yet. \n\nThe shittiness of DXC over the past few years is well-demonstrated through a simple Reddit search. Within 5 minutes, I was able to find these comments: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbtqfdyroh251.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1adb3938ff4c15fcd6eb497ff31e3712728beea\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhuq505uoh251.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18103395bbdbd2ab5cc129f259e2590c9ad328b9\n\nAll of this is reflected in DXC\u2019s share price, which has been on a downtrend for a long time:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyk558qvoh251.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6c40ae966f59e0939d1ddd5723d2af0cb2c0be\n\nEven though DXC beat earnings (Q4 results came in on May 28th), its stock price further plummeted due to other continuing issues, like diminishing revenue. The company\u2019s share price now sits at \\~$14.5 and it\u2019s market cap has declined to \\~$3.6 billion. Even though a decline in worth should feel nice and familiar for you autists, obviously this is not a company that\u2019s performing well. \n\nThe good news is that the management of the company is well aware that they are shit, and they are additionally well aware of the path towards growth: pivoting away from their underperforming verticals and into SAAS, selling unprofitable segments, and providing customers with an actually good experience. Let\u2019s examine what the company is doing to turn itself around, and whether or not this presents an opportunity for tendies.\n\n# 2. An Ugly DXCling?\n\nDXC\u2019s turnaround story is, in large part, about management. In 2019, continuing underperformance resulted in a management shake-up that saw [Mike Salvino](https://www.dxc.technology/investor_relations/ds/32534/147322-mike_salvino_biography) take the reins. In addition to looking like a [Chad](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02_lng_BrG2LumGjtCOqGH94JrRLw%3A1590772575830&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1183&amp;bih=737&amp;ei=X0PRXv25L7OIytMP4YeG0Aw&amp;q=mike+salvino&amp;oq=mike+salvino&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDoFCAAQgwE6BggAEAgQHlDVBFjSDmDPEGgAcAB4AIABVogBvQaSAQIxMpgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1n&amp;sclient=img&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi95bDSydnpAhUzhHIEHeGDAcoQ4dUDCAc&amp;uact=5#imgrc=X6Oqc96utpic5M) version of Jim Carrey, Salvino is very well-regarded in the field, and has quite a bit of experience \u201cextracting value\u201d from his time at PE firm Carrick Capital Partners. Also, he was the chief executive at Accenture Operations, which is essentially Accenture\u2019s non-shitty IT services branch. Salvino has instituted several changes designed to turn DXC around. \n\nFirst, they\u2019ve begun to focus on, well, not being shitty to customers. This is not mere talk. Prior to this quarter, 40 customers had opened challenges against DXC for services not rendered; these occasionally amounted to legal action. However, on the last conference call, Salvino noted that:\n\n\u201cOn customer delivery, we have now **fixed 35 of the 40 challenged accounts** \\[meaning the customers are retained\\]. Of the remaining five, two have decided to leave us, and we are still working the other three. Investing to fix these accounts was something I highlighted during my first earnings call, and I'm happy to report this is pretty much behind us.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s extremely good news. Another problem that has plagued DXC is its Workplace and Mobility subunit. But this long struggling area has actually been *helped* by Covid-19, and may become a big earner going forward:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpkdaxmyoh251.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=129539453ec6a126f0e5149ca5a52b0f8b7bdc40\n\nAdditionally, DXC has been implementing financial flexibility measures both as a response to Covid-19 and so as to strengthen the business generally. It\u2019s recently completed a debt-raise for [$500 million dollars](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520107182?cik=1688568), at a modest\u2014particularly for a company that has a bad narrative surrounding it\u20144% interest rate. That\u2019s good because the stock price won\u2019t get hammered by an offering anytime soon. \n\nFurther, DXC has no upcoming debt obligations that are particularly threatening\u2014in fact, the nearest debt due date is in 2022. It also recently suspended its massive 5% dividend. This news is largely what caused DXC to crash 13% on Friday, May 29th, but it\u2019s actually a smart move. The suspension of a dividend will free up further cash that can be reinvested and used to pay down interest, as well as to [raise employee salaries](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/DXC-Technology-Salaries-E1603125.htm). This is a huge point, because DXC has lost human capital by not paying its employees enough; finally, they are learning their lesson. Considering all this, the recent stock price downturn is frankly a big market overreaction (and if you were investing in DXC for a dividend, you\u2019re an idiot).\n\nBut here\u2019s the real reason to invest in DXC, as described by some fat guy named Seth Klarman:\n\n**\u201c**Spinoffs permit parent companies to divest themselves of businesses that no longer fit their strategic plans, are faring poorly, or adversely influence investor perceptions of the parent, thereby depressing share prices. When a company owns one or more businesses involved in costly litigation, having a poor reputation, experiencing volatile results, or requiring an extremely complex financial structure, **its share price may also become depressed.** The goal in spinning off such businesses is to create **parts with a combined market value greater than the present whole.**\u201d \u2014 Seth Klarman in *Margin of Safety*\n\nThis quote is amazingly apt, considering DXC recently [completed a sale](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/dxc-technology-to-sell-us-state-and-local-health-and-human-services-business-to-veritas-capital-for-50-billion-2020-03-10) of its shitty Local Health and Human Services segment to PE firm Veritas Capital for\u2026 $5 billion (**\\~$3.6 billion cash after taxes**). The market responded with huge support to this plan: DXC share price jumped around 30% in one day and remained there for months, up until it got bat-soup fucked:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q23pv531ph251.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c9194ef092dd355475092b978141074705829cb\n\nNow that we know DXC\u2019s areas of operation, ugly past, turnaround strategy, and recent stock price action, we can turn towards an examination of its financials. \n\n# 3. The Great DXCtator\n\n**\u201c**But WAIT,\u201d you\u2019re surely thinking! Doesn\u2019t it seem shocking that DXC, a company with a mere $3.6 billion market cap, will literally have that amount in cash come deal close? Surely, something must be wrong. You\u2019re probably thinking that the deal won\u2019t close due to Covid. That may be true, except for the following clause in the MAC. What\u2019s the MAC? Only the [very thing](https://www.divestopedia.com/definition/4954/material-adverse-change-mac) designed to avoid this deal getting shuttered by force majeure (e.g. a pandemic):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/233awtm3ph251.png?width=1718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3938a75584f35f80c8ad48ff615e777c6fce607\n\nOf course, there has been much skepticism still\u2014but Salvino\u2019s earnings call comments demonstrate complete conviction that this deal will go through as planned (actually, ahead of schedule). It seems extremely unlikely that such comments would be made were this not to be the case:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2f61tb5ph251.png?width=1628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb86e6154fddeb424e1099947035f0ad9116c4ed\n\nBut perhaps you\u2019re thinking\u2014if you\u2019re one of the more \u201csavant\u201d idiots here\u2014that this company is abysmal at generating FCF, and so it effectively is still a terrible investment, even with cash on hand equal to its market cap. However, you\u2019d also be wrong:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ufvzogk6ph251.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d823a78b877b8cf594db3c8bb347f7e1a187d77b\n\nAdditionally, the CEO has expressed that cash from the sale will be used to pay down debt, resulting in even more future FCF (check those large negative interest numbers on the above statement). Here\u2019s an image of a DCF that makes some terribly conservative assumptions from an [excellent analysis](https://autumncapitalmanagement.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/dxc-technology-nysedxc/) of DXC\u2019s finances (apologies for pic quality):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk1owm19ph251.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08c1bd569f3beec3293292b294af3855ff1ab8c4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz02iqscph251.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=067ea46fa7faa3c023896a648a425b4f40962fd2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxvplwfdph251.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2426564fc2cc3b958e5769f9456a18def77267a8\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, if DXC behaves as it has in the past, its current stock price implies an mouth-watering 20% IRR over the next decade. Given *astoundingly* conservative assumptions, including \u201c-50% revenue, margin contraction across the board, $1.5B in AR write-downs (40% of outstanding), and $400m in working capital additions for *five* years on a *smaller* business with currently break even working capital,\u201d there\u2019s still a positive IRR of around 5.77%. Basically, once the market properly values DXC, it\u2019s gonna fly. \n\n# 4. Catalysts\n\nWhat\u2019s gonna make the market catch on? The most obvious catalyst, and one which proves this thesis, will be the completion of the segment sale. As is mentioned above, it\u2019s expected this will occur by next September. However, I expect the narrative will change far sooner, after the initial de-risked (post-ER) stock is bought up. To truly make money, you often have to get in before the market catches on.\n\nAdditionally, the market could begin valuing DXC not on its past performance, but on its likely future performance. In a way, it\u2019s already doing that. If you recall from above, the interest rate on DXCs new bond offering was just 4%. Because the [current risk free rate ](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd03m?countrycode=bx)is \\~1.4%, if this company was as distressed as its stock price would imply, we\u2019d expect to see this interest be something more like 7.4% - 9.4%. You can do some math to see what this implies for the stock price, but I\u2019m too lazy. Basically, it means it's super undervalued.\n\nFurther, DXC\u2019s shift to cloud could prove profitable enough to change the narrative around the company. There\u2019s been a 23% uptick in qualified pipeline leads over the past few months, many of which come from cloud customers dealing with WFH, and 7% cloud growth QoQ. But they\u2019re also working to better margins, instead of merely boosting top-line growth. The company\u2019s $550-700 million cost savings plan, according to the earnings call, is expected to accelerate this coming quarter. \n\nI\u2019m getting a bit bored of writing this, so let me just end with this summary. EPS this past quarter was $1.2 per share, and the quarter before that was $1.4 per share. Boo-hoo. In that time, the stock price has more than **halved**, even though the company generates FCF, and has entered into a sale that will see them **receive their MARKET CAP IN COLD HARD CASH**. And that is what we call on opportunity.\n\n# 5. Bear Case\n\nThere are four main potential components to the bear case. The first, and most obvious, is that the sale doesn\u2019t go through. That seems unlikely based on this last ER, based on the language of the MAC, and based on the fact that the involved PE firm hasn\u2019t said anything to the contrary. But anything is possible.\n\nSecond, DXC\u2019s shift to cloud could be absolutely botched. Keep in mind that, this whole time, I\u2019ve not been claiming this is a *good company*. So I suppose that it\u2019s possible that DXC could fuck this turnaround up so badly that their future earnings come in far worse than the -8% to -10% growth they\u2019ve already conservatively forecasted for the upcoming quarter. That being said, even though they\u2019ve been shitty, they aren\u2019t exactly ignorant about IT trends. They are the largest fully IT focused company in the Fortune 500, after all.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a tiny chance that they struggle with their debt. It\u2019s not like their cap table is particularly attractive: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0jpdo4fph251.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=030a0043b46585ce2eb97982989fe540579e474e\n\nHowever, it must be kept in mind that they should have $3.6 billion cash on hand very soon, and that they are able to raise new debt at highly reasonable rates. Even if they weren\u2019t they only have $600 million of debt maturing in the next two years (and they have $20 billion in revenue). So it\u2019s not exactly like they\u2019re on the brink of bankruptcy. \n\nFinally, as some old guy said once, the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. So even if *everyone knows DXC* is undervalued, that doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t stay that way. In my opinion, this is the true risk. It\u2019s much easier for investors to buy into the narrative that a company is undervalued because it\u2019s going to do better than expected, than it is to get them to believe that a company is deservedly getting shat on, but that said stream of shit is coming at far too high a flow-rate. But I also am confident in the market\u2019s efficiency. \n\n# 6. \u2018Tutes for the Slutes\n\nAs always, it\u2019s best to assume that some loser from Bridgewater has figured this shit out already. So let\u2019s see what the smart money thinks about DXC. First, note that it has an extremely high level of institutional ownership\u2014around 80%. You can see the many funds holding it [here](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=dxc). To me, this shows good faith in their future prospects.\n\nAdditionally, ER reports are catching on to the fact that DXC is undervalued. Morgan Stanley [just set a $33 price target](https://markets.businessinsider.com/analysts-opinions/dxc-technology-overweight-715630). Citigroup and Cowen have also recently upgraded to a buy rating. Even JPM, who is neutral on the stock, has a price target of 17. That\u2019s \\~16% higher than price at time of writing.\n\nEssentially, smart money is betting on this play. With a recent ER having de-risked the stock, I believe that now is a great time to get in. I predict we won\u2019t see this below $\\~14 for the foreseeable future.\n\n# 7. TL;DR / Play\n\nDXC is retardedly undervalued. Even with worst case assumptions, it should go up from here. I contend that a run up these next few months, and then the closure of the $5 billion sale will assuage almost any fears of these worst case assumptions. Keep in mind that this company is generating almost the same EPS as the quarter previously in one of the worst crises we\u2019ve ever seen, will have $3.5 billion in pure cash after tax, and has taken **real** steps to implement a turnaround. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll take the market long at all to catch on\u2014I expect there to be a runup prior to their next earnings call on August 9th. If the company can merely beat its conservative EPS forecast and confirm the deal is still good, which it almost certainly will, all is gucci. Because of that I\u2019ve loaded up on:\n\n# July 17 $16 &amp; $17 calls\n\nI\u2019m also going with stock since it\u2019s been nicely de-risked, but you guys don\u2019t give a shit about that. Positions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxcjccogph251.png?width=1426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0aa80ccafed5f14971384e7e77135ebefadf230\n\n***All I can say about DXC is this\u2014remember all the girls you didn\u2019t think were hot until they turned around?***",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, there are a lot of articles suggesting that the world debt crisis is out of control and that we are heading for more than a recession/depression.  Possibly a currency collapse and who knows what will happen after that.\n\nThis is partly due to COVID-19 but we were in trouble way before that.  I don't think this is news to anyone here.\n\nWith the world debt to GDP ratio at an all-time high, unprecedented QE measures in all major countries coupled with the shutdowns and effects of COVID-19 things look pretty bleak.\n\nWe are in a credit/currency crisis much larger than the 2008 crisis, there is no debate about that.  \n\nIn September 2019 global debt was about $253 trillion. Which is 3.3 times the global GDP. That was before COVID-19.  As of the end of 2019, we were sitting on $87 trillion more in global debt than at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis.  The same things that caused that crisis are still part of the system.\n\nIn addition to printing money like there's no tomorrow the US fed is buying \"unlimited amounts\" of mortgage-backed securities.  Remember that MBS's were one of the biggest factors in the 2008 crisis and the only way we got out of that was printing money and bailing out the banks.\n\nI understand that QE measures are supposed to provide liquidity so that the economy can keep running and people/companies have access to credit.  The US didn't ween off of QE since the 2008 crash though.  In fact, they increased the measures in late 2019 and are now pumping out trillions in bailouts and stimulus on top.  That took over a year last time but the US came out swinging with trillions in bailouts in the first round in 2020.\n\nCanada is following the same approach.  In March the bank of Canada dropped interest rates to near-zero while committing to buy $250 billion in Government of Canada bonds.  That is where the CERB money and other stimulus is coming from.  Canada is in better shape than many countries such as the US.  Mostly due to stricter regulation in the banking sector, we aren't out of the woods by any means.  If global credit locks up we won't be insulated from that.  \n\nThe only thing keeping global credit from locking up entirely is the influx of newly printed money from world governments.  Are we going to print money to infinity?  What happens then?\n\nIt seems that nearly 100% of this sub still has faith in the stock markets, real estate, and the currency itself.  The market is artificially high right now due to QE and bailouts.  We all know that the market is basically a cesspool of corruption but you'd have to be blind not to recognize that it's on life support right now.\n\nCan somebody explain to me how we are able to print money and bailout indebted corporations without causing rapid inflation and/or causing the global economy to implode?\n\nHow can you invest in the stock market right now with any confidence at all?  We are very likely to see major corporations unable to service their debt very soon.  The bailouts saved them for now but that money is already spent.  The global debt elephant is massive.  In recent months many highly leveraged companies have been unable to service their debt.  \n\nWe are already seeing a string of large corporations filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\nHere are a few examples from May alone: Reitmans Canada, the ALDO gorup, Gold\u2019s Gym, Roots USA, Hertz (car rentals), JCPenney, J.Crew, Latam Airlines, Pier 1, Virgin Australia, Flybe (UK airline), and Diamond Offshore Drilling.  There are way more, these are just some of the greatest hits.  Retail was obviously hit the hardest so far.\n\nPretty much all airlines that didn't receive government backing have gone bankrupt.  Air Canada is due to go bankrupt again but they will almost certainly get bailed out.  The oil sector doesn't look any better, these sectors aren't isolated they are just the first dominoes to fall.  I can't see a scenario where bankruptcy rates don't accelerate in the next year and that will spread into other sectors.\n\nAll I seem to hear is something along the lines of \"it hasn't happened before so it won't happen this time.\"  That's just complacency.  I'm not here to say the sky is falling.  I want to learn why people still have faith in the system.  Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nI want to be convinced that the economy isn't going to collapse but I want to see some real arguments other than blind faith.\n\nTL;DR: I want someone to explain how global currencies won't collapse taking the stock market and real estate with it.  \n\nPlease don't post cute/clever comments about bears, chicken little and that kind of BS.  I'm looking for a discussion here not the typical witty comment contest.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been noticing a lot of new Redditors on here that don\u2019t really have the capital to go and drop thousands or even hundreds into stocks so I decided I\u2019d offer a little advice from someone who started the same way. I started trading in Feb with a flat $1,000 I pulled from my income taxes, I did zero research and bought a lot of terrible stocks on a whim and lost over $700 of that when the market tanked in March. Through a lot of research and a little luck I built my capital up and am now making a study income off of my weekly trades, here\u2019s a few tips.\n\n1. Don\u2019t focus on potential money, focus on percentage. This is key for new investors making a dollar profit per share is awesome....except when its on a $100 share. Focus strictly on ROI percentage when starting out.\n\n2. DO NOT GET EMOTIONAL AND BUY A PEAK!!! It really sucks when you\u2019re seeing a lot of people celebrating on this thread on a stock you missed out on. That doesn\u2019t mean buy in at a peak and then lose money when it falls. It\u2019s much better to walk away breaking even, than walking away kicking yourself over a stupid loss. (Speaking from UAVS experience.)\n\n3. Take your gains and bounce. This rule is true to all investors but even more so for those playing with small accounts. Build up your capital before you decide to take any sort of risk. Do not get sucked into always trying to hit home runs, take your 10-20% victories and never look back. Do not feel remorse for missing out on what could\u2019ve been extra profit, better to be a steady gainer than to be a bagholder.\n\n4. Above all else, use the good of this forum and learn to navigate the bullshit. This is one of friendliest reddit forums I\u2019ve ever seen. Lots of lifelong investors and even a few millionaires are sprinkled into this forum, many of which are more than happy to share knowledge and tips with people strictly out of the good of their hearts. If you have a question ask and you\u2019ll learn fast. On the other hand, don\u2019t buy into bull shit pumpers just trying to use your money to recover losses. This forum is for tips, advice and shitposting. It isn\u2019t a gospel to buy every stock you see on here.\n\nHappy trading and I hope this helps at least someone out.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nLast time i posted some leads you guys liked it so i'll give back to the community some more.\n\nThese are some of the plays that I think would be good. But please, don't take my word for it. Do your own DD and go with your thinking.\n\n **XSPA** did good today based on an article published saying that airlines are opening back up travel to popular vacation areas and etc | great investment because sooner or later they will have more PR based on airlines maybe contracts can see a huge upside***\\[*****11:36 PM*****\\]***\n\n**HTGM** did good because of an article published saying that they did good at their ASCO presentation | This is amazing like a bonus because I wasn't holding for this specifically, i'm holding for their research on covid 19 once we get PR on this then the stock will moon***\\[*****11:40 PM*****\\]***\n\n**GNUS** did amazing today ran like Usain Bolt, however I feel a lot of people are FOMOing into the stock. I feel the stock ran because it regained compliance and the offering closed which are two good components. Maybe they're setting up for another offering we'll see on the 3rd if they have a huge run again then i'm sure they will. I'll probably buy in with a small position in hopes of getting 20% and getting out. If there is an offering i'll be getting into GNUS big. Catalyst on the 15th when their cartoon channel is up. \n\n**NBRV** offering was supposed to close on or about june 2nd, I like the company and I feel like with covid 19 going around they have a huge role to play in this .77 cents is a pretty good price for this stock currently under 200 5min sma and has a PR on Thursday this can see some upside coming \n\n**CJJD** offering closes tomorrow drop HUGE because of offering and because of Trump speech about China. This having and offering and being a China based company has made the stock drop significantly. however, I feel when the offering closes it'll rise back up in due time. This isn't an investment or a swing trade but a subtle scalp play. Maybe get anywhere from 10-25% on it and i'll be happy. \n\n**TLSS** is down HUGE over the past 2 days legit dropped from .26 high to .05 low which is amazing to see | They dropped because of their 10K stating that they had spent a lot more money than they made and have a lot of debt. However they have earnings coming on the 29th and it's stupid cheap right now I feel like it'll start to go up as the month goes on. They had a partnership with amazon early in the year and maybe it won't show on their Q1 earnings but on their Q2 should be much better. This would be a Medium to Long hold depending on how it behaves when earnings come out in Q1. If it runs we sell, if it doesn't we hold until their next earnings. \n\n **RTW** could be a good play because of Vegas reopening on the 4th! However, i'm not sure about my stance on it yet because of the protests, riots and looting going around. Especially with the second wave of corona that came around and huge mass gathering of people i'm sure that we will be seeing a dramatic increase in infected people around the nation. It might lead to shut downs of states and etc maybe more quarantine. Especially with the fact of the looting going around and stores being shut down or being looted causing a lot of stores to close down. If there's a quarantine 2 as well then I could see RTW going lower. So i'm iffy on this.\n\n**MARK** going right back at this, AMAZING investment at least in my opinion. I could lose out huge on this but I could also make a lot of money. we've seen this company run a lot in the past and over the course of a month it's seen 300%+. Now what i'm speculating is that when Disney world resort opens back up in July 11th that MARK will have a contract with them to install their infrared cameras in their park and resort. NBA is also to be held in the Disney world resort so this could be huge for MARK because infrared technology is a big factor in reopening business's during covid 19.  (This is hypothetical and just my speculation don't take it seriously.)\n\nI would also like to know your investments as well if you'd care to share. We could have a discussion on them in hopes of maybe making some money off of it. Anyways, feel free to leave your thoughts I would love to hear your arguments or thoughts on subjects!",

        "selftext": "With this company running up like crazy, I figured I would dig through some old news and financials to see what's going on. I'll preface this by saying that I have no position in this company, and I'm just throwing ideas out there in order to determine if people really believe in this company in the long-term, or alternatively are capitalizing on the short-term volatility. It seems pretty clear that the latter is true, but I'm bored at work and would like to hear some of your thoughts, so here it goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Right now this company is trading at \\~$6.00 per share, with a market cap of \\~$590M or roughly 100x 2019 revenue of 5.9M. They have also never posted a profitable year.**\n\nThe historical financials are not looking good: [https://imgur.com/gallery/ef0uEV1](https://imgur.com/gallery/ef0uEV1).\n\nI dug through some old 10-K's and it looks like the elevated revenue in 2012/2013 (6.6 million and 2.6 million) was due to physical media sales such as DVDs in addition to physical products, think merchandise. Revenue then drops to 0.9M for several years until 2017 where they sold Llama Llama to Netflix for what I'm assuming was in the ballpark of $4M based on the huge bump, was too lazy to find the actual sale amount. Revenue drops back down in 2018, then bumps in 2019 due to the sale of Llama Llama season 2 and Rainbow Rangers Season 1, which was in the ballpark of $4M+ again.\n\nLooking down towards their bottom line, they've run up significant losses over the past 8 years, not posting a single profitable year in the time horizon I evaluated. **The 8 years of revenue totals $24.1M while the losses total -$55.7M.** This is concerning from a long-term viability standpoint as it seems Genius is unable to generate any money for shareholders. While they have created several very successful programs in recent years, it seems that they are unable to profitably deliver content. \n\nFinancials aside, I decided to look into this newly announced Kartoon Channel! to learn more about the actual product. I found YouTube channels for Kartoon Channel!, Kartoon Channel! Jr., Rainbow Rangers, and Llama Llama as I figured this would be a somewhat useful proxy for popularity and viewership. KC and RR videos averaged several thousand views per video while KC Jr and LL videos averaged in the low ten thousand views per video. Maybe GNUS is hoping to monetize on ads and turn a profit on that revenue stream, but given their current viewership (proxied from YouTube), it doesn't seem that they are going to generate much money. I'm also not very well versed in advertising revenue, so thoughts on this component from more experienced people would be great.\n\nI'd like some more information on the Kartoon Channel launch on June 15th, I can't tell if this will be a stand-alone streaming application, or simply a combination and rebranding of their existing content. Hoping that some of you who are smarter than me can dig into this and provide some clarity. Reddit won't let me link the press release, so I'm copying it below:\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/06/2028502/0/en/Genius-Brands-International-to-Launch-Kartoon-Channel-Digital-Network-Across-Amazon-Prime-Apple-TV-Comcast-Cox-SelectTV-DISH-Sling-TV-Tubi-Xumo-and-More.html#:\\~:text=Kartoon%20Channel%20is%20a%20digital,anywhere%20in%20a%20safe%20environment.&amp;text=New%20platforms%20launching%20Kartoon%20Channel,%2C%20Plex%2C%20and%20Canela%20Media.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/06/2028502/0/en/Genius-Brands-International-to-Launch-Kartoon-Channel-Digital-Network-Across-Amazon-Prime-Apple-TV-Comcast-Cox-SelectTV-DISH-Sling-TV-Tubi-Xumo-and-More.html#:~:text=Kartoon%20Channel%20is%20a%20digital,anywhere%20in%20a%20safe%20environment.&amp;text=New%20platforms%20launching%20Kartoon%20Channel,%2C%20Plex%2C%20and%20Canela%20Media.)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: GNUS seems like a pump and dump stock and I'm failing to see any long-term prospects for the company.

There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall development cycle.\n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\nThe need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market.\n\n[The networking market](https://mordorintelligence.com/images_db/RD_Images/1556091324027_Picture2.png)\n\n# # My motivation\n\nCloudFlare is releasing and bolstering support for streaming, video, and communications as a security-first cloud provider in the following week. This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.\n\n[CloudFlare Distributed Video Support](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EZN7_YMVAAAE8Qg.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # In Short\n\nCloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:\n\n\\- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers\n\n\\- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor\n\n\\- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development\n\n\\- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft\n\n\\- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/) and distributing VPNs.\n\n\\- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world\n\n\\- **\\*\\*Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' computing. -&gt; YOU ARE HERE**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cofounder of NPM - a module system where software developers shipped code.

A content delivery network.\n\nCDNs are distributed datacenters. This technology has been rapidly improving in the past 5 years and has drastically reduced the cost of business for small businesses and enterprises alike.\n\nThinking trucking logistics. You need to load up and send heavy duty materials, safely, quickly, and across multiple checkpoints along a highway.\n\nAn easy way to think about CDNs is to imagine it as the E in 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution). Through the power of CDNs, you're able to render images, videos, streams, content, data, transactions, privacy, and much more through the network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Securing digital assets on a reliable infrastructure for the most intensive computing cases.](https://preview.redd.it/dnpn9c3t4m251.png?width=2210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2be51c709a803d5dbac47c4bb471d9ca77bc047c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Why does this market matter? Competitive advantages\n\nThe reason Snapchat did not gain any traction did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast , cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # What's special about CloudFlare as a network?\n\nWhat CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its privacy-first approach. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private network (VPN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply. Privacy and speed sells.\n\n[Facebook: \"The future is private\"](https://preview.redd.it/gn6ibx4p4m251.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a88aa1e694ab0e62af8856bdeae914f62cd7182)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cloudflare grows with security](https://preview.redd.it/me09oa3pem251.png?width=2332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658486274c4b3c61fa689c5166b14f8c5775a953)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # What is serverless computing?\n\nServerless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model.

        "selftext": "I'm a numbers kinda guy, and lately I've been looking at what are some of the trends before a penny stock becomes the next insane momentum runner. To be honest, darkpool data is typically the one that shows up a lot. Biotech pennies (for instance) have large darkpool prints before a major hype. For instance, if you do have access, look at the PTI Darkpools before the last data catalyst. You can distinctly see that darkpool prints happened before the hype and then distinctly dropped a bit before the data release. Once these hedgefunds take positions, then they a) field their pumpers and eventually it becomes a self-fulfilled prophecy or b) the hype naturally becomes known to retail because of news articles etc or c) both. \n\nOne of the stocks that has consistently been coming up on the top 20 stocks on darkpools is HEXO, and recently, it just registered one of its highest DPIs (darkpool indicator). Generally, the higher the DPI, the more bullish the hedgefunds are feeling towards a particular stock. DPIs are great indicators for upcoming momentum (for instance, for the past two days, MU, RTX and JPM have had the highest DPIs across the entire stock market, and thus I wasn't surprised much today to see that these stocks made monstrous moves). On the other hand, the registry of low DPIs often indicates that a rally on a stock may be dying a bit. Tesla registered one of the lowest DPIs yesterday so I wasn't watching it today. As it happened, it didn't really make much of a move. While DPIs are not an end all be all, they're a great tool for finding some of the stocks that so-called smart money is pouring money into (or taking money out of). \n\nNow, let's be honest here: this is pennyland and there are stocktwits pumpers that are propping stocks up. There are some massive pumpers on HEXO (primarily mrinvestorpro, who basically manipulates the market). It's noticeable to see that the large prints on darkpools started as mrinvestorpro started pumping HEXO. Is Mrinvestorpro just a paid promoter for a bunch of sleazy hedgefunds? Most likely yes. With that said, will the stock run up a lot? Absolutely. I think everyone here knows that pennies are pumps and dumps and here it seems like HEXO is about to experience the next pump.",

        "selftext": "If you check my previous post history, I was spot on about LULU, even if people didn't like the DD because I posted it up a little late. That stock has exceeded my expectations. I figured I'd post a heads up about an overvalued company that I think will likely drop hard post earnings.\n\nI'm going to all in on puts before their earnings calls on June 9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Company Summary:**\n\nFive Below is a company that markets itself to Karen and her kids. It's a discount retail store that is targeted towards producing goods for teens/tweens. The idea is that all of the goods are $5-10. Most of their growth throughout the last several years have been centered around store expansion, acceptable margins, stock buybacks, and an expectation that their existing stores will sustain the opening of new stores. \n\nComparable companies include Dollar Tree and Dollar General, however FIVE is no where nearly as established or fully mature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financial Statements:**\n\nNotable points from Q4 2019 ending in Jan:\n\n\\-Only 0.6% of comparable sales growth (stores that were open for the full fiscal year) implying their revenue growth strategy is heavily dependent on store expansions - very heavy on capital expenditures and ever increasing lease obligations. They aren't able to squeeze much more out of the stores that already exist.\n\n\\-Seasonal sales cycles. Q1-Q3 were each roughly 60-70% of revenue compared to Q4 which ended in Jan. The winter season makes up a huge chunk of their annual sales.\n\n\\-$261M\\~ in cash &amp; CE going into Q1.\n\n\\-No long term debt aside from capital lease agreements &amp; a revolving credit line\n\n\\-From their 10k: Expected minimum rents of $152M for 2020 or $38M/quarter\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EPS estimates:**\n\nCurrent estimates put them at -.21 EPS, which is a loss of $11.68M @ 55.6M shares outstanding . I have a good feeling it's going to be worse than this.\n\nConsider that sales are heavily seasonal so their most recent quarter is not indicative of the rest of the year.\n\nAssume they hit 50% of revenue from their best non-holiday quarter in 2019 - Q2 @ 417M w/ 35% margins\n\n$72.98M\n\nAssume SG&amp;A costs dropped to 85% of 2019 Q3 (using this because Q4 was higher due to holiday surge) at $106M\n\n\\-90.1M\n\nThat leaves them at -17.12M for the quarter or -.31. This is with some optimistic projections that they are able to replicate their best quarter during covid with a total shutdown that occured from March-April.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no strong online presence. The company does not list direct to consumer numbers, and their target demographic are not going to be looking to shop online at their store. They are too heavily dependent on walk ins for sales. If anyone has kids they know that they're visual and are not online shoppers. If a parent wants to shop for their kids online, they're going to Amazon like any sane person would with their free prime shipping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comparison to competition:**\n\nThere's a lot of optimism going forward for Five Below because of the of the \"recession proof\" feel for discount retailers - most notably Dollar General and Dollar Tree. I don't believe Five comes even close to either and will perform considerably worse both this quarter and in the long run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Revenue dependence on seasonal sales:\n\nDollar General has very stable year round revenue each quarter of about $6-7B with a nominal spike in the seasonal quarter. This quarter they did exceptionally well because the store is a \\*general\\* store and sells general household goods - not just junk or trinkets.\n\nDollar Tree is about the same but experiences a roughly 10% increase during the seasonal quarter compared to the rest of the year. This quarter they performed about the same as Q4 because they offer some basic household items.\n\nFive Below has a 30-40% increase in sales during the seasons compared to the rest of the fiscal year. The store has some household items for sale, but in general it's a kid focused store that offers mostly clothing, sports, decorations, and candy for sale. \n\n\\-Store numbers and availability:\n\n\\-Dollar General: 16,278. Look on a map and you'll find them everywhere in the states. They are especially predominant in smaller rural towns that aren't big enough to warrant a Walmart or large grocery chain. Anyone who has taken a road trip will know that you can find a Dollar General in even the tiniest outpost town. Additionally, post covid their stores close at 9-10 PM.\n\n\\-Dollar Tree: 15,288. The same with Dollar General. They are slightly more concentrated in the cities, but they can still be found in relatively small rural towns. Post covid, store hours have been 8-9 PM\n\n\\-Five Below: 900. They have practically no presence outside of cities which are also the most likely to be sensitive to distancing and cramped retail stores. Post covid, stores close at 7 PM. Leaving the least amount of time for a consumer to shop after normal work hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Forward looking:**\n\nOf course this is what the big boys will be caring about. Even if the EPS is off they will tell themselves it's priced in. Here is where the stock's trend prior to the covid collaspse comes into play. The growth of the company has been \\*entirely\\* based on more stores going up. From 2018-2019 they went from 750 to 900 stores. Almost all of their cash flow went into buybacks, store openings, and capex for a couple of distribution centers.\n\nWhat hasn't been flagged or created a stock drop was when they had to tap into a larger line of credit on 4/29 indicating that the collapse of their cash flows is going to be a problem to cover some overhead costs. Most likely going forward the rate of expansion is going to be thrown off as it'll take at least a year for revenue to bring back cash reserves to a healthy level without issuing new equity/debt. They haven't been able to squeeze more money out of their stores and any increase in margins has centered entirely around store openings to take advantage of shared advertising and corporate admin costs. They dropped roughly $96 mill for land in Texas &amp; Georgia for new distribution centers (from their 10k) With the first quarter likely leaving them at $100M\\~ in cash going into Q2, they won't be able to expand nearly as rapidly. There is also no telling how bad covid is really going to get. While they may plan new store openings, it's unlikely to be a reality as any openings will take a year before they can get close to the same profitability as an established location. Since they are largely classified as a \"growth\" company, they need a reason to justify their high P/E ratio. No growth = correction incoming. It takes about 300k to open a new store, and until the store is capable of contributing to the profit line, it is just a drag with overhead costs. Until it becomes absolutely clear just how stable the \"reopening\" will be any outlook is pure speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI estimate that the stock will drop to about 85-90 after earnings. As it is now it's been floating around 102-106. I DO NOT recommend buying short dated until we get closer to earnings as the current market conditions are not favorable to any sort of short position until there's a very good reason for it. There is some indication that the big boys have picked up on it as it fell today. If you do want to get in early, long date them so theta doesn't completely murder you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be aware that any DD on WSB is advice you should take with a grain of salt. Also be aware that optimistic comments from the exec board could undo the realities of their balance sheet. If you feel skeptical, either hedge it with a spread or avoid altogether.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: Once 6/8 hits, I am going to all in 6/12 $100 puts. \n\nOther positions that currently have a lot of OI: 91p 6/12 - 92p 6/12 - 85p 6/19\n\nLong dated puts with heavy OI (possibly smart money or hedges): 55p 8/21 - 75p 8/21 - 110p 8/21",

        "selftext": "Hello Team, \n\nThis is my first post ever on reddit, so let\u2019s hope it sparks a good conversation. I\u2019m not talking as if I know it all, but I just wanted to write a good catchy title to grab your attention. \n\nI\u2019m a 23 year old guy, who\u2019s been investing in the markets for 3 years. I had 15k of OSAP debt which I paid off ever since I started working at a bank in downtown. I\u2019ve been living at home with my parents so I don\u2019t have to worry about rent. The rest of my money, excluding expenses on food/gas/entertainment has been put straight into my TFSA, because I believe that as I go further on in life my tax bracket will go up. So financially, it makes more sense to max out my TFSA contributions now and worry about RRSP contributions later. \n\nI saved up several grand each year and was waiting for a market drop to buy into companies. I eventually saved 25k before the stock market dropped so I bought 2 chunks of RY.TO stock, which is Royal Bank of Canada. The bought the first chunk at $91 and the 2nd chunk at $84. So I own $25,000 of RBC at $87.5/share. I\u2019m getting dividend income of over $200 a quarter, which should drip me 2 shares a quarter. \n\nIssue: Should I enable a DRIP to take advantage of compound interest so I can retire early? Or should I add my dividend income to my usual TFSA contributions and start to diversify and buy companies like Nike, JNJ &amp; MSFT? \n\nPeople have become rich by just buying more and more shares of the Canadian banks, so if I know it\u2019s worked in the past, why differ from that success? I know there\u2019s historical bias here, but realistically, the banks make money in the good and bad economic times.\n\nThanks for your time :)",

        "selftext": "*TL/DR: I'm bearish because of the looming unemployment, the market is already overbought, the fed can't fix every part of the economy, and because of the political and social unrest this year already has and will continue to bring. Would love to hear and discuss counter arguments.*\n\nI've been hearing countless arguments, first from the bears that COVID was undoubtedly the start of the next Great Depression, then from the bulls that were laughing at the bears because J Powell cancelled the recession and the V shape recovery is looking pretty good.  So here we are, 3 months later and the market is heading back toward the all time highs of February.\n\nI can understand a lot of the bulls argument and the \"don't fight the fed\" mentality. Right now, there really isn't a better place to stash your money than stocks. However, if we really sit down and think about what has already happened and what is on the way for the rest of this year, I truly can't see this momentum going through 2020 and into 2021. I still have some individual positions that I will continue to hold, but I am considering putting a lot of money into an inverse S&amp;P500 ETF (SH, SDS, SPXU) and watching as the next year unfolds. My bear argument for the next year:  \n***1)*** ***Unemployment:*** Unemployment is currently sitting at 40 million Americans. Recent study from the University of Chicago ([here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/most-americans-see-layoffs-as-temporary-but-research-shows-otherwise.html)) says that 42% of those people won't have jobs to come back to. Even being conservative on the study and assuming 25%...that is 6 million people permanently unemployed. \n\nEvery company and industry has had to learn to adapt to at home work for the last 3 months, and that's going to cause a lot of companies to take a look at what jobs are really necessary to function and likely leave lower skilled Americans without jobs.\n\n***2) Market was already overbought before COVID and still is:*** Pretty straightforward on this one, coming into 2020 the market was already seriously overbought after the 11 year bull run and was due for a correction. It got a massive correction, but now is right back into overbought territory. PE is 23 and Shiller PE is 28.73 (median is 15.78)...a correction at these levels seems likely even without COVID. Low interest rates have made stocks the only game in town which is why they are being flooded into, but that does not make a lot of these companies well-run businesses worthy of their current valuation. Balance sheets and cash flows matter, and eventually investors are going to expect to see earnings, and a lot of these high flying \"COVID stocks\" won't be able to provide them.\n\n  \n***3)*** ***\"Unlimited\" QE can only do so much:*** I know, don't fight the fed. The fed can print money, but it can't create demand and jobs. If my case about unemployment and overbought markets are even halfway true, the feds printing is only a band-aid that will eventually have to be taken off.\n\nWe also don't really have a great idea of what \"unlimited QE\" even really means or looks like. Does it mean infinite from a dollars scale and/or a time scale? Does this unlimited QE only apply to what the fed considers COVID related issues, or will they just have to keep printing like this in 5 years or 10 years for any decline? Essentially I feel like the market is being completely propped up by the Fed, but that printing cash doesn't actually generate demand and *genuine* cash flows for a company\n\n  \n***4) Political and Social Unrest:*** This is the one that everyone knows about and almost jokes about at this point. Another set of bad news and the market roars higher. How sustainable is it really?\n\nI believe that COVID alone was enough to drag down the market substantially...but we have so much more going on than just COVID. \n\nWe have a President of the #1 economy who blames COVID directly on the #2 economy in the world...which will almost guarantee there is no trade deal happening with China anytime soon. With COVID, Hong Kong, and Trump, the situation with China will only deteriorate as the years go on. \n\nWe have an election year with arguably the most controversial president of all time who is going to use all means necessary to win or defraud the election. Either Trump wins another 4 years and we trust him to rebuild us in a post-COVID world, or he loses and very likely creates what will certainly be a democratic crisis. How many people truly see him going away peacefully? All we need is a couple of close states and \"fake news, election fraud\" are all over his Twitter and Fox News and we have a genuine crisis on our hands. Can't imagine this November-January being pretty in either scenario.\n\nSocial unrest is here to stay. People are furious right now and the cities aren't just burning because of one thing (although police brutality toward African Americans is a MAJOR issue) but because of YEARS of mistreatment and a system that does not work. The system is rigged against those in the bottom, the wealth gap has been growing for years, and I feel that these protests, pushed further by Trump, is society's way of showing that this just isn't sustainable. The masses at the bottom are demanding a true change. I'm not sure if they're going to get it or not, but I'm pretty confident they won't between now and November.\n\nSo...all that being said...I'm shorting the market using inverse ETFs. Who agrees?",

After this report was released, Huawei attempted to obfuscate it's dealings with Skycom leading to another detailed report being released in March of 2013.  (The [2012 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230) / [2013 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131) respectively). \n\nIn response to the Reuters articles released in 2012 and 2013, several banks questioned Huawei about its relationship with Skycom. This included HSBC, where both Huawei and Skycom held bank accounts.\n\nIn the U.S. indictment, specifically, Meng is being charged for participating in fraud involving HSBC. But this was a point of contention since the representations she made weren't technically criminal under Canadian law, i.e. no sanctions. What was criminal, however, and what ultimately led to Meng being charged is the actual act of making fraudulent misrepresentations, which is criminal in both the U.S. and Canada as well. ([The full 36 page Supreme Court ruling if you're interested in reading](https://www.scribd.com/document/463254844/2020-BCSC-785-United-States-v-Meng))\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\nMoving forward, I think the primary question we have to consider now, is what exactly is going to happen once Meng is extradited to the United States. Were it any other case, this would be a pretty clear cut white collar fraud cause. Of course, this isn't just any case, and the context of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as ongoing geopolitical issues like with the Hong Kong protests, all have to be taken into account.",

        "selftext": "Been looking into potential reverse merger companies (SPACs) and came across Spartan Energy Acquisition (SPAQ).  This is a company, similar to VTIQ and DKNG, that exists for the purpose of effecting a merger to bring a private company public at a cost much lower than a traditional IPO.\n\nI want to lead saying SPAQ has NOT announced a potential target as of yet, however, their deadline to effect a merger is August 13, 2020 or else they have to liquidate.  \n\nI think that it is unlikely that this will happen as they are managed by Apollo Global (a legit private equity firm) and has $569M in its trust account at the end of Q1 2020.  Rather, I think it is likely that they will announce a potential target and set a shareholder vote to extend the deadline to effect a merger prior to Aug 13 (how nearly ever other SPAC has done leading up to the merger date).\n\nOnce a target is announced, the stock (SPAQ) and the warrants (SPAQWS) will pop, and again following the shareholder vote.  Doesn't really matter who the target is, since the warrants are trading at .60 right now (well under the $1.5 listing price when the SPAQ was set up).\n\nThen again - the risk in all of this is that no merger is announced and the SPAC liquidates on August 13, leaving the warrants worthless.  So keep that in mind before you drain your life savings into this one.\n\nTLDR: Buy SPAQWS - some risk, big reward.",

It's to do with warrants between internal investors which was actually agreed in March and the SEC filing today was just paperwork to finalise it.\n2.\t\u2060The massive dip was caused by the spread of misinformation (see point one); whales selling and cashing out which in turn led to alot of new investors who bought at $10+ to panic sell.\n\nThe combination of the two factors just set off a chain reaction and caused the stock to tumble down. The fact that's it's recovered so well and comparable to levels from just yesterday makes me feel like there's plenty of gains to be had.\n\nHowever, as a caveat, I don't believe GNUS will rise at astronomical rates now due to the psychological fears behind it and investors selling early to focus on recouping losses rather than investing short/long term.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't be surprised for the stock to slowly rise up until the 15th as it gains more and more momentum and hype behind it again. $10 to $12 seems quite reasonable around launch date.\n\nTwo catalysts at play\n\n1.\t\u206015th June (launch date obviously)\n2.\t\u2060And the 'news' promised by the CEO to come out in the next few days (Fingers crossed the SEC filing wasn't the 'news')\n\nAnyway at the end of day do your own DD and don't listen to a random stranger on the internet for financial advice (especially a pleb like me)",

Everyone has a camera. Every riot, shooting, and violence is rapidly spread on social media. Fear drives gun sales and increases stock sentiment.  People are scared, people want to protect their businesses, protect themselves from the government, etc., etc.\n\nNot to mention the FBI has reported a significant increase in firearm background checks, with almost 3 million gun permit associated in April. This is the fourth highest its been since statistics on this have been kept, and March shattered the overall record with 3.7 million firearm background checks. It\u2019s no secret that the pandemic is the primary cause, but this demonstrates the strength and overall movement we will likely see in the coming weeks for gun manufacturers as consumers react to the violence on their televisions, social media, etc. \n\n[https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics\\_firearm\\_checks\\_-\\_month\\_year.pdf/view](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)\n\nRuger &amp; Company (RGR) is a prime example of this, for Q1 they reported net sales of $123.6 million\n\nPositions: \n\n$SWBI 14.5C 6/12\n\n$SWBI 15C 6/12\n\n$RGR 67.5C 6/19\n\n$VSTO 12.5c 6/19\n\nI\u2019m going to be playing some short term calls for now and eventually move toward long-term calls as I\u2019m confident earnings for Q2 will dwarf Q1 and lead to some juicy tendies. \n\nLike I said I\u2019m retarded, but I\u2019ve noticed no one\u2019s really discussed this here so if some smart people want to chime in go ahead, but I\u2019m counting on fear and uncertainty to moon gun manufacture stocks.\n\nTLDR: Calls on SWBI, RGR, VSTO",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m an idiot for noticing something this morning but not acting on it.  Both gold and SPY were up early yet most of the miners were even or slightly down.  As soon as one of those pulled back I knew they would dump but still held anyways.  Gold pulled back, miners tumbled.  So that lead to an interesting debate as to the relationship between Gold, SPY and the miners.  It\u2019s a very tricky one because I know that gold and SPY technically are inverse of the others at times as gold acts as a hedge for the market.  However, everything dumped in March and they have also bounced at similar times.  So I decided to do some chart overlays to see what the hell is going on.\n\nFirst, how does Gold and SPY move? \n\n[Gold with SPY overlay since bottom of March]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/qZ18Tg8l/)\n\n[Gold with SPY overlay since January 1]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/uA1bLrW9/)\n\n[Gold with SPY overlay monthly chart since March 2008]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/DZxvuXCt/)\n\n[Here is one I like since you can see how it comes and goes \u2013 GOLD weekly with SPY overlay since November 2016]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/WR4TTtrb/)\n\nAs you can see from the charts, there are times that SPY and GOLD will move in the same direction (March 2020 dump, early to mid 2017) and then there are times where they move opposite directions (April \u2013 August 2018, a lot of 2013).  Basically this shows me that gold is more of a steady climb with some following of global markets while SPY has more violent ups and downs.\n\nSo what do the miners do?  I have to pick one or else it may get too messy so I looked at the charts to see which has the longest history and how they look and honestly \u2013 Kinross, Barrick and Yamana all look similar with long timeframes.  I just chose ABX because I am invested and I\u2019m doing the analysis so.\n\n[ABX weekly with Gold overlay 2020]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/8LQY6QWi/) .  Pretty close early on until the last three weeks.\n\n[ABX weekly with Gold overlay last 5 years]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/g6rnOAbR/).  Again, the size of the pullbacks and runs are different but overall follows pretty closely the movement which is not surprising since these are gold miners.\n\nSo what does it look like with SPY?\n\n[ABX weekly with SPY overlay 2020]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/ToLbK10J/)\n\n[ABX weekly with SPY overlay last 5 years]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/JeV5BPY6/].  More of what we saw with the Gold/SPY overlay chart where there are some movements similar but some different.\n\nJudging by all these graphs here is my conclusion \u2013 Gold miners tend to follow the direction of GOLD with the size of the bounces/pullbacks changing slightly.  GOLD follows SPY only when there are significant market shocks.\nSo why the hell are gold miners so weak right now?  More below for my guess.\n\n\n**Markets** \n\nChart Perspective \u2013  Definitely still in an uptrend and it was looking toppy until we ran into EOD.   We had $306.84 from May 28th; $306.13 from the 29th, $306.20 from yesterday, a gap up above pre market that sold off in the morning and a bounce that rejected at 307.19 but that goes out the window with a $308.13 finish.  I still if we don\u2019t gap up we could see bears pile in as bulls looked tired for most of day.\n\n Investor Perspective \u2013 see past posts.  Medium term bear.\n\n**Energy and Oil Companies** - MEG Energy Corp, Crescent Point Energy, Cenovus Energy, CDN Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, Enbridge, Teck Resources Limited, Husky Energy, Vermillion\n\nChart Perspective \u2013  I noted the 5x top on MEG.  Today is an example of what happens when that top breaks and there is no resistance until $4.  Increase in volume after the break as people ride the wave of no resistance.  Of course this is all helped by the fact that oil prices keep pumping.  The rest of the sector pumped too and those 4 hour gaps are looking like a thing of the past as most are at the top of their equilibrium or broke it bullish.\n\nInvestor Perspective \u2013   I still believe that 99% of gaps get filled without a significant news related event.   Now the question is, did the economy reopening bring these names up so that they are where they are supposed to be, or is some priced in and we can see a pullback?  I still think the second.\n\n**Gold Miners** -  Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold.\n\nChart Perspective \u2013  My intro said enough about gold miners pulling back.  We had a couple drop to more lows (K, ELD), some barely holding on (ABX) and some still looking decent (YRI, BTO, KL).  \n\nInvestor Perspective \u2013  So I\u2019m going to adjust my thinking here a bit based on the charts.  I think gold tends to slowly go up while adjusting to big market shifts.  If SPY does have a second strong pullback, I think gold goes with it and so does the miners.  If it only has a minor pullback, these names can maintain their relationship with gold and follow it.  I also think that the harsh pullback over past few weeks is an outlier compared to what gold has been doing and the relationship over the past years.  My guess is \u2013 Gold does pull back but the miners don\u2019t fall as hard or gold bounces and the miners go hard.\n\n**Marijuana Stocks** - Canopy, Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSO\u2019s.  \n\nChart Perspective \u2013 Good on APHA for holding the green but WEED continues to show great weakness from their financials.  I suspect a test and most likely break bearish soon (coinciding with SPY consolidation).\n\nInvestor Perspective \u2013 I will not make this mistake for a 3rd time.  I said I was going to get WEED calls every time it fell below $20.  I didn\u2019t and it ran 30% both times.  I won\u2019t make that mistake again.\n\n**Banks** - BMO, RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD\n\nChart Perspective \u2013 Call it a boost with oil companies or just people establishing long term positions but nice short term movement on banks.  Again, not all banks created equally based on charts.  RY, CM have already broken bullish, TD with the break but slight pullback while BNS, MFC, BMO still in equilibrium.  Overall a good recovery in this sector after being weak for so long.\n\nInvestor Perspective \u2013 Still not expecting anything big until next quarter financials when we start to see what sort of provisions came to fruition.\n\n**REITS** - Brookfield, Smartcentres, Riocan, HR Real Estate\n\nChart Perspective \u2013  These charts are all over the place.  HR, which ran a ton, is looking like it\u2019s going to test $9.50 support again soon and if it breaks down there isn\u2019t much support until $9.  BPY still holds up well after the dividend sell off.  BAM, although still with a weak chart, got a nice bounce today.\n\nInvestor Analysis \u2013 Honestly, I am surprised BPY is still holding up so well after that run into dividend.  I still hold HR puts which I will look to flip if we break $9.50 and go test $9.\n\n**Tech** - SHOP, Lightspeed, Real. OpenText, Kinaxis\n\nChart Perspective -  Sideways.  This is why I believe people do trade more than invest.  Notice how for weeks these names ran while energy and banks were sideways now people moving money into those while these names pulled back and are now just moving sideways.  Not much going on here.  Still holds uptrends so no worries there.\n\nInvestor Perspective \u2013 See past posts.\n\n**Air Canada** \n\nChart \u2013 Super Super tight range today.  Multiple inside bars on 4 hour timeframe.\n\nInvestor \u2013 Bulls afraid to make a move in case of dilutions.  Bears scared to make a move in case of a bailout.  \n\n**Blackberry**\n\nGuess I should cover blackberry after the day they had.  Rumours of buyout pushed this up, the potential buyout company said no, it pulled back hard, and then bounced.  From a chart perspective, that is a long wick of buying.  From a chart perspective it screams continuation.  From an investor perspective, I\u2019d wait to see if the news of the buyout calms down and more of a pullback happens.",

We don't have a rule against microcap stocks, but they're susceptible to pump &amp; dumps and those posts will be removed as spam/promotion and possibly autoremoved. Consider r/pennystocks, r/weedstocks, or r/CanadianInvestor\n\nBut the problem with this is that a pump can take days to weeks, so by the time we act it's already too late and a lot of users will fall victim to the dump or think they're clever and short only to time it wrong or realize the bid/ask spread is extremely wide and they're immediately at a loss when they get in.\n\nSo we have updated the rule to no penny stock discussions at all:\n\n&gt; **Rule 7: No penny stock discussions, including OTC, microcaps, pump &amp; dumps, low vol pumps, etc. Consider r/pennystocks, r/weedstocks, or r/CanadianInvestor instead.**\n\nWe're actually falling in line with subs that have banned penny stocks since forever like r/wallstreetbets:\n\n&gt; No non-reporting penny, microcap, OTC stocks, low volume options, cryptocurrency, or any other worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump &amp; dump schemes.\n\nAnd r/stockmarket:\n\n&gt; No penny stock/OTC/low volume pumps, yes, we can spot them easily\n\nWhile r/investing doesn't directly reference penny stocks in their rules, they remove penny stock discussions through their moderation bots &amp; automod.\n\nOur criteria for what a penny stock will be similar to [Investopedia's definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp):\n\n* Typically trades under $5 or previously traded under $5 before the pump\n* Below 300 million market cap or previously traded under 300m before the pump\n* Typically trades on OTC markets\n* Usually has missed reporting/filings; no auditing or odd auditing issues\n* Can have low volume or wide bid/ask spread\n\nSo while a stock might be over $5 or over 300m marketcap, but it was previously below those levels, we're going to consider those a penny stock and remove those posts to prevent users from engaging in a pump &amp; dump.\n\nI know a lot of users will be happy about this and at the same time angry/upset over it.  But this is for your protection and raising the standards of the sub so we don't see shit stocks on the front page on a daily basis.  Also a lot of users behind the scences have struggled to tell us and report on penny stock discussions when they weren't pump &amp; dumps, such as using the report button, so now those posts/comments reported on will be removed since they fall under the new rule of no penny stock discussions.\n\nIf you see someone discussing a penny stock that fits the criteria above, **please use the report button.**   Thank you.\n\nFeel free to leave your feedback below, but please do not bring up penny stocks as an example or circumvent automod to do that.  We're not going to ban users unless they're purposely promoting penny stocks or circumventing automod.\n\n-----\n\nAnother mod explained the purpose of this a little better than I did:\n\n&gt; The purpose of the rule is mainly to prevent automated bots (or users) from using our community to manipulate a stock for profit.\n\n&gt; We hope this makes the rule easier to interpret and follow so we can prevent our community from being used for market manipulation while still allowing discussion of legitimate companies.",

        "selftext": "\\*\\*\\*If you want the cliff notes, skip to the bottom paragraph. \\*\\*\\*\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize but the big kaboom is probably happening before our eyes. To be sure, what I am about to describe is still a relatively low probability outcome but in the previous 2 months it has gone from a less than .01% probability to about 5-8% probability. That in and of itself is downright terrifying. What I am about to tell you, nobody is talking about right now. None. Not even the big boys on Wall Street. Not the big bulls like Kolanovic or Siegel nor the big bears like Albert Edwards.\n\nSo, what is this insane kaboom scenario that has equity markets surging like it\u2019s 1999? It\u2019s simple. In the next 2-3 months, we are very well may see the equity markets surge to SPX 4,000 (maybe even 4,200). Yes, that\u2019s right 4,000. It will be a monstrous run. As the market surges higher, the doubters will continue to try and short it wherever they can. **But with every 10-point dip in SPX being treated like a generational buying opportunity** this will result in continuous short covering, exacerbating the move. However, by the time we reach September, it will be clear to literally everyone including pajama traders that this is a massive asset bubble. Stocks will be trading near 30-32 forward earnings. However, unemployment will remain near 11-13%. At this point we will start seeing cracks in the FX market which will really start to worry the Fed (like, actually make them worry). They will finally, at last, be trapped; inflating an obvious bubble while still trying to fight elevated unemployment levels. With an obvious asset bubble and unemployment still extremely elevated, they will try to hint at moves to withdraw liquidity or raise rates while still trying to fight unemployment. This will result in a violent two-month trading range as we head into mid fall. **The market will call the Fed\u2019s jawboning bluff as the market makes one last parabolic surge to SPX 5,000 by December, pushing forward P/E\u2019s to the stuff of legend.** At this point, the cracks in the FX markets will be undeniably painful.\n\nThis will be the time for choosing for the Fed. Withdraw liquidity or raise rates and the bubble pops resulting in permanently high unemployment. Refuse to do so and the dollar cracks while consumer confidence tumbles, also resulting in permanently high unemployment. **There is no way out.**\n\n*And think about it\u2026 this scenario fools all market participants in their current understandings. The bulls will just keep championing the fed, believing they caught the bottom and are riding a massive bull market. On the other hand, many bears will capitulate and get long while the remaining bears won\u2019t even know how to position because they never imagined equities skyrocketing as a part of the big kaboom scenario. It\u2019s max pain to as many market participants as possible.*\n\n***KABOOM!***\n\n**Cliff Notes Version: S&amp;P ramps to 4k by end of August. Unemployment is still double digits. Serious cracks in the FX market start to appear. Fed genuinely feels panicked as unemployment isn\u2019t falling but an asset bubble is clearly brewing. Fed tries to jawbone markets to believe they might actually raise rates or withdraw liquidity to get the bubble under control. Violent trading range for 2 months. Market calls Fed\u2019s bluff. Surge to 5k by December. Fed loses control, is trapped. Choice between popping bubble and insuring high unemployment for many years to come or continuing to fuel the bubble, destroying the current FX regime and consumer confidence, also insuring high unemployment for a very indefinite period of time. Kaboom! The end!**",

        "selftext": "2020 has been an absolute insane year so far; and unfortunately, not in a good way. With all the protests breaking out in every corner of the country, there is likely a high chance that the sales of guns and ammunition will skyrocket (and it's already started). And the longer these events keep happening, the more firearms industry might benefit, since both private citizens and military will be loading up. To be honest, I even started thinking that all the protests that are seemingly so well organized at the same time in every major city could be some kind of conspiracy instigated by firearms manufacturers. This would have been a great way to get a share of that dumb money that has been flooding equity markets over the last couple of months.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve done some DD to identify potentially profitable deals. \n\nThere are two gun manufacturers that are publicly traded U.S. companies:\u00a0American Outdoor Brands, parent of gunmaker Smith &amp; Wesson, and\u00a0Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. Both are small capitalization companies.\n\n1.  American Outdoor (NASDAQ: AOBC). Market cap: $716M; 1-year return: -37%\n\n2.  Sturm, Roger (NYSE: RGR). Market cap: $988M; 1-year return: 7%\n\nThe first one can\u2019t be bought on Robinhood (such a loss. lol). Stocks of RGR literally skyrocketed yesterday and pre-market this morning. The stock is trading at $71. Up from \\~$60 on Friday. Based on RSI it\u2019s also super overbought and I can\u2019t find any solid potential level I would be making a bet on. $75 could\u2019ve been a good level, but now we\u2019re too close to it and the options are overpriced. \n\nThere is also Vista Outdoor, which is a shooting sports company, but I do like neither their financials, not the how the stock price looks like (trends, etc).\n\n3.  Vista Outdoor (NYSE: VSTO). Market cap: $863M; 1-year return: -59%\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Olin, which I think has a high potential. It\u2019s not considered a gun manufacturing company. But it does manufacture ammunition products. From Bloomberg: \u201cOlin manufactures products that include sporting ammunition, reloading components, small caliber military ammunition and industrial cartridges.\u201d And ammunition will definitely be in demand. \n\n4.  Olin (NYSE: OLN). Market cap: $6.16B; 1-year return: 45%\n\nTheir stocks are currently trading at $12.5. The options are relatively cheap. The company also seems to be almost at their all-time low. RSI is around 53 and based on MACD, the trend just turned around and we started moving up. \n\nI think we might be a couple of days late, but I don't think the boat is missed completely. $15.5 seems to be the next strong level that is definitely very reachable in the next couple of weeks. Might go to $19, if lucky. \n\n**TL;DR: OLN 15 call 6/19**",

        "selftext": "This is just a back of the envelope calculation. Not all Berkshire companies are included so this should really be a lower bound of the intrinsic value of Berkshire\n\n|BH Asset|Value in Billion USD|\n:--|:--|\n|[Their stock portfolio](https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/)|205|\n|Cash |130|\n|Occidental preferred (10B payed, doing a 5B write down)|5|\n|Precision Castfarts|35|\n|BH Energy|35|\n|BNSF |35|\n|Lubrizon|10|\n|Duracell |5|\n|Sees Candies |1|\n|Pilot Flying J |3|\n|NetJets |2|\n|Marmon Group|5|\n|Clayton Homes|2|\n|IMC|5|\n|Dairy Queen |5|\n|Various construction and materials companies |5|\n|Various logistics |4|\n|Fruit of the Loom + Russell Brands|2|\n|||\n|Geico |25|\n|General RE|50|\n|||\n|Total|570|\n\nSources are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Berkshire_Hathaway and https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/\n\nThis is a conservative estimate of the value. There are some big companies that are left out. There is also some small debt that is left out but in truth the company could take on an additional 100B loan if it really wanted - that would only be 50% leverage on their stock portfolio not even counting their other assets that they can lend against. \n\nEven if you discount the value of the cash position with 25% (because it is just sitting there doing nothing) then Berkshire is very much undervalued. If you discount the entire 130B cash position then Berkshire is trading at fair value.\n\nSome people might note that over the last 1,5,10 or whatever many years Berkshire has (slightly) lagged the S&amp;P500. Well no shit if it is only trading at less than 80% of the intrinsic value then yes it has lagged. But if it were trading for its true value it would have clearly beat the S&amp;P500. The fact that it has not beat the S&amp;P500 because it is trading below what it is worth is what makes this an opportunity because this gap will close.\n\nI know that many here will say that the stock is going to tank once Warren dies but really I think that would be good for Berkshire. It is trading at a discount in part because Warren has been very busy doing nothing for many years now. Once he dies that cash is more likely to be used than it is now, either for buybacks or for acquisitions, or even for buying SPY. \n\nSo many people have said they are waiting for Berkshire to go down once he dies and that will be when they buy in. I think there won't be that opportunity. This thing is so much undervalued already and lots of investors are ready to go once he passes away.\n\nSure it could be another decade before he gives up control over Berkshire but there will be something done with the cash pile before then. Either they buy back stock, buy that elephant, or they buy SPY. Until then it is a well diversified company. \n\nThe only thing wrong with Berkshire is they are underleveraged. Not the worst mistake to make. \n\nSome people on here already know some or all of this, like u/100_PERCENT_BRKB, but for the rest I think this is a great opportunity to outperform the S&amp;P500 over the next 1 to 5 years.

        "selftext": "If you\u2019re not investing in private prisons right now, channel your autism and try to pay attention for a couple minutes.\n\n* In the last 2 days 4,400 people have been arrested for rioting. Those numbers are about to go way up.\n* GEO is the second largest private prison stock in the US, and it\u2019s CEO George Zoley has been shovelling money into the Trump administration since 2016 in exchange for lucrative contracts ($225,000 given to the Trump Super PAC Rebuilding America Now in 2017 to start).\n* In 2019 GEO paid Ballard Partners, one of the most influential lobbying firms in Washington, $120,000 to lobby for public-private partnerships in correctional services. Ballard Partners is run by Brian Ballard who was a leading fundraiser for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. He was also named regional vice chairman of the RNC finance leadership team in 2017.\n* The federal government generates 53% of the company\u2019s revenue.\n* GEO stock has recently slumped as a result of fewer people being arrested during the coronavirus stay at home orders, but since the pandemic has been cancelled and mass arrests are happening nationwide due to the riots, GEO stock has a lot of room to pump. I know we autists like to buy high and sell low but this is what traders call a \u201cdip\u201d which can be very profitable to buy.\n* Here\u2019s a map of GEO\u2019s prisons. Look at that and then look up a list of the cities that have the most riots. Spoiler, GEO\u2019s prisons are located in all of the major cities that have protesting and rioting. Their headquarters is in LA which had more arrests than any other city yesterday. ([https://www.geogroup.com/Locations](https://www.geogroup.com/Locations))\n* Koch Industries created the TPPF (Texas Public Policy Foundation) whose \u201cRight on Crime\u201d campaign successfully passed the \u201cFirst Step\u201d act in 2018 with the help of Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law. The bill created $375 million in funding for mandatory rehab and \u201cjob training\u201d for private prisons. The TPPF aims to \u201creduce government spending\u201d by encouraging the privatization of prisons and reducing partnerships with non-profit organizations which they did successfully. If you aren\u2019t seeing the pattern, Trump has a vested interest in private prisons, particularly GEO as he\u2019s buddies with the CEO.\n* GEO CEO George Zoley is also a long time contributor to Florida\u2019s governor Rick Scott, who is also close friends with Trump.\n* GEO increased their lobbying expenditures from $560k in 2015 to $1 million in 2016 to $1.7 million in 2017 and have been shovelling money at Trump and friends ever since.\n* GEO creates the tech used for house arrest and owns mental health facilities.\n* There are widely spread rumors that ICE will be using the riots in LA to round up immigrants. Maybe it\u2019s true, maybe not. Either way, GEO\u2019s headquarters are in LA and they have multiple facilities in LA. One way or another, this is going to be great business for GEO.\n\nWhat\u2019s the downside? Although GEO has plenty of volume, there is NO volume for higher strike prices. GEO is currently trading in at $12.63 (It was $12.10 when I started writing this post), and the strike prices of $14 is the highest you\u2019ll find any volume in. Since their stock was $17 in March, you\u2019re going to want to buy the cheapest FD\u2019s you can get.  I\u2019m currently loaded up with 6/19 $14, but am also buying a bunch of cheap FD\u2019s for higher strike prices in July when I can get them.\n\nTLDR: If you\u2019ve been living under a rock, there\u2019s a bunch of riots. Buy some private prison stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: GEO is already up 6% for the day. Wanted to let people know who are concerned about the ethical ramifications of investing in private prisons that I will be donating a lot of my gains to criminal justice reform charities through a donor advised fund. I recommend Googling that term if you're interested in doing the same.",

        "selftext": "## What is UNFI Food?\n\nUnited Natural Foods (UNFI) is a food wholesaler. They are currently best known as the [supplier to WholeFoods](https://www.refrigeratedtransporter.com/foodservice/grocery/article/21712244/unfi-extends-distribution-agreement-with-whole-foods) and is one of the largest food distributors in America.\n\n## How the coronavirus plays in\n\nGrocery spending is higher, [up 27% from this same point last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/shoppers-shift-from-stockpiling-to-penny-pinching-at-the-grocery-store.html). Online groceries have skyrocketted as well, projected to [increase by 40%](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/online-grocery-sales-grow-40-2020) in 2020. The growth in online grocery sales is obviously the result of COVID with 52% of consumers polled stating that 2020 was the first time they had purchased groceries online; note the massive spike in [APRN](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/APRN). Let's also not forget about lower fuel costs and higher food inflation, which increased [2.6% in one month, or 4.1% for 12 months so far](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), for \"food at home\" category. This obviously benefits UNFI further. In addition to this, UNFI will benefit from the [CARES act](https://www.waste360.com/food-waste/keeping-food-table-pandemic) via increased deductibility of interest expenses, potential for tax loss carrybacks to prior years (at a higher, 35% tax rate) and faster depreciation of improvements. The exact amount is hard to estimate, but it will be just icing on the cake. The cake is described below.\n\n## Earnings\n\nEarnings is [June 10th](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/unfi). What's interesting is that this company were so excited to release their earnings, they put out a [preliminary report](https://ir.unfi.com/news/press-release-details/2020/United-Natural-Foods-Announces-Preliminary-Third-Quarter-Results-and-Provides-COVID-19-Business-Update/default.aspx) and they absolutely hit it right outta the park. Adjusted earnings per share was up 130% from 61 cents during the same time last year. Revenue for the quarter comes in 12% higher than the $5.96 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. They also reported a net income of 88 million a 57% increase from the same period last year. **The company pulled their 2020 guidance since they said they already hit it and they\u2019ll update it when earnings come out.** These guys did their ENTIRE year of projected earnings in ONE QUARTER. They used this to pay off massive amounts of debt and even sold off some stuff that they can use to pay debt down further. As a result of this preliminary report, the stock price popped to $22ish and has now dropped a little since. When the updated earnings report comes in, I expect the stock to really pop. But since it won't be for another 13 days, we can play off the earnings run-up as well as more investors buy in with anticipation. A lot of people are going to say the news is already priced in due to the preliminary being released, but it really isn't. Updated guidance for 2020 should be announced at earnings and this will be the catalyst for movement. Last reported short percentage is 18% of float, so this could put a hurt on the shorts when guidance comes out. \n\n## Previous Highs\n\nThe [stock traded at high 40s](https://i.imgur.com/aH4Spts.png) back in 2018 and has been getting shit on since down in the teens. But right now, everything about this stock shows it\u2019s going to continue upward and the full earnings report will be the catalyst. In 2018, the company [bought SuperValu](https://ir.unfi.com/unfi-acquires-supervalu/default.aspx) to expand into conventional grocery, increase scale, realize synergies and, likely, diversify away from reliance on Whole Foods. A large part of this massive drop from high 40s was due to investors thinking this decision was trash. For a while it seemed that SuperValu acquisition was an expensive mistake as there were delays, extra expenses and customer service issues. Well jokes on them because it ended up working out and now it\u2019s paying off in spades. This acquisition gave the company a leg-up from other competitors who are struggling from coivd19-related supply chain issues, as UNFI can easily reach all of their retail partners quickly with 58 locations.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nSkip this part if you're not super into the technical details. While the expected GAAP ([generally accepted accounting principles](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/GAAP-generally-accepted-accounting-principles) earnings per share and net income are already impressive, it is actual free cash flow that matters most. It is especially true for UNFI, since they need to reduce debt and move from around 5x leverage to the target they have of under 3x. The free cash flow, or FCF, is significantly greater than net income for the following reasons.\n\nThe company made a 338g tax election, which allows it to depreciate acquired SUPERVALU assets accounting them at a high tax base, resulting in high depreciation non-cash charges, much greater than ongoing CapEx. Depreciation appears to be running $30 million less than CapEx per quarter, or $120 million annualized.\n\nAt $30 million per quarter or $120 million  a year, the difference between D&amp;A and CapEx contributes another $2.24 per share in free cash flow. The end result is $426 million in annual adjusted FCF or $7.96 per share. Assuming the cash flow goes to debt reduction, the annual interest expense gets reduced by $25 million a year, improving net profit by $20 million and increasing EPS by $0.37.

If I change my mind, I'll be putting edits at the bottom of this post like I did with my previous DD's. This stock was given a price target of [$22, raised from $10](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+PT+Change/United+Natural+Foods+%28UNFI%29+PT+Raised+to+%2422+at+BMO+Capital/16889479.html) by BMO Capital analyst Kelly Bania about 2 weeks ago, but I think it'll go higher. There are some analysts that claim it can go back to last year's valuation of $40 per share long term, so holding shares of this stock wouldn't hurt either.\n\nAlso shoutout to /u/theodros1 who posted DD on this a week ago but only got like 16 upvotes. \n\ntl;dr I'm buying $22.5c 6/19",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow autists,\n\nHere's a rundown of how the world economy uses USD and what it does to its value and underlying economy:\n\nThe American Dollar is the global reserve currency\u2014an international medium of exchange and store of value for most major countries.\n\nThink of USD like an international Gold Standard, a hedge against volatility or sudden changes in exchange values.\n\nUSD is the primary vehicle through which international commodities are purchased (e.g. oil) and debts are serviced.\n\nIf the world\u2019s GDP PPP looked like a pie:\n\n* U.S. Global GDP (PPP): 24%\n* China Global GDP (PPP): 15%\n* Everyone else: &gt; 6 (each)%\n\nWhere does the world\u2019s supply of USD come from?\n\nCountries and foreign interests buildup stockpiles by purchasing U.S. Treasuries (American Debt)\n\nUnlike a gold standard, the USD is tied to an economy creating inherent advantages/disadvantages, creating a Trade Deficit within the U.S.\n\nThis trade deficit is self-reinforcing rather than planned:\n\n* International demand outweighs supply of the global reserve currency, driving value up\n* Higher USD values make US exports less competitive and imports more affordable\n* The result: U.S. buys more than it sells and makes up the difference by selling treasuries (U.S. dollars and debt)\n\nDirect access to a high value currency has an unintended side affect on U.S. residents:\n\n* U.S. residents benefit from higher relative asset values &amp; greater borrowing power enabling U.S. residents to live beyond their means\n* It also hollows out the U.S. manufacturing and labour sector by negatively affecting their competitiveness as an affordable international workforce\n\nInternational debts also increase demand for USD in a cyclical manner:\n\n* Higher debt leads to more debt servicing in USD, increasing demand for USD which increases the value of USD, which increases the value of the debt, which must be serviced in USD\n\nDebt to GDP ratios for most countries have been rising in recent years, exacerbating this trend.\n\nHow much debt/USD is out there?\n\nAbout $12.1 trillion in USD as of Q3 2019.\n\nThis is\u00a056%\u00a0of U.S. GDP, and\u00a078%\u00a0of U.S. broad money supply.\n\nIn other words, there is an extreme supply/demand issue for USD.\n\nThe strength of the USD impacts growth of non-U.S. markets:\n\n* Low USD value supports growth in emerging international markets\n* High USD values hinders growth in emerging international markets\n\nHere is a representation of past and potential future USD values:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77cu5vadmb251.png?width=545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=616bdd0395b892d30628500799bc90d25a45d5bb\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nAs international S&amp;P outstrips domestic S&amp;P, the U.S. becomes vulnerable to its own rising dollar value.\n\nIn other words, the more revenue the U.S. generates outside of its own economy, the more they stand to lose when they exchange foreign currency back into their own rising USD (e.g.: S&amp;P 500 now receives over 40% of its revenue from international sources).\n\nRecent U.S. corporate stagnation has been somewhat masked by higher equity valuations, corporate tax cuts (boosts after-tax profits), and companies buying back their own shares each year to increase-per share earnings despite company-wide operating income stagnating.\n\nForeigner investors/governments have been buying very little U.S. treasury notes (debt) since 2015 due to the strengthening USD.\n\nConsequently, domestic sources have had to buy most of it:\n\n* 4.6 trillion in U.S. treasuries issued from Q1 2015 to Q3 2019\n* $3.9 trillion funded domestically, meaning $3.9 trillion USD was removed from U.S. financial system and converted into Treasuries over a five-year period\n\nThis resulted in a large USD liquidity drain.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve immediately printed money to borrow and buy the excess U.S. Treasuries, stabilizing the Repo Market.\n\nE.g.: newly issued Treasuries are now funded by newly created dollars, removing liquidity drain.\n\nThe global currency system is running into a supply issue: as large as the U.S. is, its share of the global GDP is diminishing, while demand for USD is rising.",

        "selftext": "After reading a previous post about $ITCI, I decided to dive into all of the data and break down all the technical jargon in an attempt to better understand the opportunity here. This is my first attempt at writing up my DD.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**$ITCI Stock**\n\nPotential options:\n\n**$ITCI 6/19 $25c**\n\n**$ITCI 7/17 $25c**\n\n**Also a TL;DR at the bottom**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT is $ITCI?**\n\n$ITCI is Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company based in New York most known for its recently FDA-approved drug lumateperone (CAPLYTA), offering a unique take on schizophrenia treatment with very minimal side effects.\n\n**WHY are we looking at $ITCI?**\n\nThey have imminent data releases regarding large clinical trials that are expected to show positive results. One data release set for Q2, another set for mid-year 2020.\n\n**HOW do we profit from this?**\n\nHistorically, $ITCI has had large price spikes when positive data is released. Data release is imminent, likely beginning in June. Longer term outlook, if trial data is positive, further FDA approval and marketable drugs will provide ITCI with a much larger market in which to make money.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nITCI has just recently had their drug, lumateperone (labeled CAPLYTA), approved by FDA for use at the end of 2019 after very positive clinical trials. This drug is used to treat schizophrenia, and compared to existing treatments, is novel in that the side effects are much more minimal. CAPLYTA sales/marketing began at the end of March, reporting \\~$880,000 in sales in just the last one or two weeks of Q1 (mainly to supply wholesalers). It's still early, but results from the clinical trials and the initial physician and patient reception has been positive.\n\nHowever, what we're looking at for the price spike is not the success of CAPLYTA, but rather the results of not one, but two upcoming data releases.\n\nThe first data release is regarding a clinical trial using lumateperone for treatment in bipolar disorder, which if successful, would greatly expand the market for ITCI's drug. This data release date per the most recent earnings call is \u201cmid-year 2020\u201d, however, another autist [makes the case for a June release here](https://medium.com/@codyenexile/another-itci-spike-incoming-diligence-done-8d625ff29754). The results of this trial are assumed to be positive because similar results were found in previous trials, [mentioned here](https://ir.intracellulartherapies.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intra-cellular-therapies-announces-positive-top-line-results-0).  This trial is Phase 3, which is the last step before FDA approval is granted.\n\nThe second release is regarding ITI-214, a separate treatment targeting patients with chronic systolic heart failure. This treatment acts as a PDE-1 inhibitor, which has shown positive results in heart treatment [example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5513860/)\n\n[example 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023290/).\n\nTI-214 has completed Phase 1-2 clinical trials and is awaiting results data \u201clater this quarter\u201d per the Q1 2020 earnings call this May (so, June 2020 release). Positive data from this trial would be very bullish for ITCI, as it could potentially open a whole new market for them - cardiac treatment in addition to psychoactive treatment.\n\n**ADDITIONAL PROS AND CONS:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. Per the earnings call, the recent COVID events have not impeded the clinical trials. The launch of the CAPLYTA drug has also been successful in spite of COVID, thanks to telemedicine and online capability. In addition, patients have not stopped seeking treatment for mental conditions and physicians have not stopped providing care.\n2. Some large institutional investors, including BlackRock, have recently [increased their stake in ITCI](https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5649746/blackrock-inc-buys-527274-shares-of-intra-cellular-therapies-inc-nasdaqitci.html)\n3. In general, institutions have put in [$156M in Q2 2020 alone](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ITCI/institutional-ownership/), largest being Fidelity and BlackRock. This is much much larger than any other quarter so far\n4. Recent analyst price targets for ITCI have been positive, ranging from $26, to $35, to $50+.\n5. A competitor in schizophrenia treatment, Minerva Neurosciences ($NERV), recently reported disappointing Phase 3 trial results of their own, easing pressure on upcoming competitive threats.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. Despite reporting \\~$450 million in cash/cash equivalents and investment on the last earnings call, ITCI continues to burn money and is not yet in a position to reap big profits from CAPLYTA. Will need to keep an eye on financials if taking a long position.\n2. Although approved by the FDA and showing positive clinical trial results, CAPLYTA is very early and there are little real-world results to show for it as of now. Success of this drug is necessary for ITCI to stay relevant.\n3. Insider selling may be [a concern](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ITCI/insider). There has also been very recent [insider buying though](https://newsfilter.io/articles/4-form-ac9be466332a794a156140ff7d3f1e06),I don't know enough about this shit to form an opinion so I'm putting it in Cons because brainlet.\n\n**//--TL;DR--//**\n\n**The Good:** history of price spikes on positive data, drug recently approved by FDA, next data releases imminent and likely to be positive based on past results\n\n**The Bad:** company has $450 mil cash but isn't making money yet; drug released and approved only recently, little data available on sales outlook and patient reception. Questionable insider buys/sells?\n\n**The Ugly:** look in the mirror\n\n**Positions: $ITCI Stock** (for the longer hold)\n\n**$ITCI 6/19 $25c** (banking on June data releases)\n\n**$ITCI 7/17 $25c** (coverage in case data is released late June or early July)",

        "selftext": "My father passed away young and left me his estate. Im not 100 % sure yet (working with CPA's now) but the 3.3 MM he held in options will probably be taxed at the maximum income tax rate so I am looking at losing 1.65 to taxes (Worst case scenario).  It certainly isn't fun. (selling over the years isnt really an option since I have to exercise within 18 months/and dividing the sale over 2 years only increases risk with less than 2% savings). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very new to ETFs and Index Funds. My goal is to somehow make most of the 1.65 MM back with low risk. I have a few CFA's I am talking to who all advise go all into the market right now (as soon as the sales are done). I also have a cousin who's father is a very successful hedge fund manager/owner who says its a bad time to get into the market. Psychologically even though CFA's dont make commission they still get a % of my net worth with them- so convincing me to enter the market is still a good idea. I dont really see how my best interests would be in mind when its basically a cold decision of put money in the market with them or not (at a 1% fee)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there a way to estimate how long this economic downturn will last (in years), and approximately how long it will take to get back to positive returns on Index funds and ETF's? (seems like the SP500 never stays negative for more than a year or two return wise). \n\nIs there a chance the SP500 and other ETFS will never come back or is that more a doomsday scenario? \n\nWill dollar cost averaging the 1.6 MM I am expecting left over after suffering the maximum tax rate the best way to go- and how long would you suggest I spread this over?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes these are questions to ask a financial advisor as well- which I am doing but when it is the question of giving them my money or not- I dont see why they would ever advise against it- hence I am here just looking for opinions.",

The next year you gain %10 but now the 10% is applied to 1100 not 1000. And so on.\n\nHow does this actually work though? That's not really compounding. That is just a stock going up 10% per year. For it to compound you would need to reinvest your gains. Using the example you would take the $100 in gains and buy 10 more stocks. That wouldn't actually work though because the stock would now cost $11 so you wouldn't gain anything by selling off your gains and rebuying the stock.\n\nIm confused. How does this work?",

They love keeping their retirement money in \"safe\" investments, SPY to be particular. And what do we know about liberals? They're stupid.\n\nHence, these liberals will take their parents money out of SPY, and bet it all on SPY calls because stonks only go up, but because so many people are withdrawing their deceased parents' 401(k)'s across the country, money will be leaving the market faster than JPow can print it.\n\ntl;dr SPY $225P 11/20",

It can be used to express a bearish view on the market, if you expect the market to **fall fast or fall a lot**\n\nYou can find a lot about it on the internet and it\u2019s really not rocket science so I\u2019ll [send you to Fidelity for the technical deets](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/options-strategy-guide/1x2-ratio-vertical-spread-puts) and just focus on how we use it to fade a rally.\n\n# How do you use it\n\nWhen the market is toppy and vols are coming down, it\u2019s an easy way to fade the market with limited risk in case the rally continues hard.\n\nYou deploy it with 1-2m tenor options and keep it for 2w at most. The key aspect is that the option has a good payout profile as shown above: **on a short-term horizon your loss profile is very contained** even in the triangular loss area where the loss is highest.\n\nIf market falls fast you profit, if markets rally hard you lose 0, if markets move sideways you bleed a bit of theta. The point being, if the market keeps rallying you get a second chance to try again.\n\n# Pros\n\n1. Protects you from bad timing: if you want to go short and the market rallies, you lose nothing and try again\n2. It works well to fade an equity rally because usually at the top of the market i) vols are low and ii) the fall can be fast\n3. *Bonus: you see the triangular loss area? When you fall there, usually vols are moving up and this gives you another boost to limit losses*\n\n# Cons\n\n1. Works only if the drop is large and/or fast, and profits will always lag a vanilla put\n2. Has negative theta at-the-money for the first week - if the market stays flat, you bleed some\n3. Has 3x transaction costs than a normal put\n\n# Is now a good moment to use it\n\nIt beats buying vanilla outright puts for sure in terms of premium deployed, but with VIX at 29 it's still nowhere near a good moment to be long vol - but again, beats buying outrights. With vols &lt;15 at index level, this becomes a no-brainer\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nRemember that like any other option structure, this a specialized tool for a specific task. It will not make money per se, rather it will help you express a view with a control on the loss profile.",

        "selftext": " [https://oracledispatch.com/2020/06/01/gearing-up-for-the-pot-stock-election-run-mjna-crlbf-mctc-curlf/](https://oracledispatch.com/2020/06/01/gearing-up-for-the-pot-stock-election-run-mjna-crlbf-mctc-curlf/) \n\n \n\nThe 2016 general election November vote was one of the biggest catalysts for the cannabis space. 2020 is shaping as potentially another similar situation, with 4 states already on the ballot for legalization (2 for recreational) and another 6 states pushing to get on the ballot (5 for recreational), making it potentially even more explosive for the overall legalization movement than we saw in the historic 2016 process.\n\nThe rationalization for this last claim is about percentage change: the ultimate shift would be to get cannabis legalized on a recreational basis in the majority of the US, thereby putting pressure on the federal government to accept the verdict by states and start removing federal statutes around cannabis, which would likely accelerate the dominoes as a \u201ctipping point\u201d phenomenon.\n\nIn percentage terms, if all states seeking to get on the ballot for recreational \u201cadult use\u201d legalization are successful in doing so, then 2020 will be a bigger shift (provided they all pass) than the movement in 2016.\n\nIn other words, start getting your pot stock portfolio picks together ASAP. Below you will find our thoughts and analysis on some of the more widely discussed names in the space, including: Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA), CRLBF, MCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC) aka Cannabis Global Inc. (OTCMKTS:MCTC), and CURLF\n\n**Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA)** isn\u2019t what we would consider a \u201cprime investment pick\u201d in this space. The company has remained on the pink sheets, offering up unaudited financials only for all of its tenure as a publicly traded stock (and we\u2019re talking about years here), despite claiming tens of millions in revenues. In case you\u2019re wondering, this is not remotely typical. As far as we can tell, MJNA is the only stock in the history of the world that fits this description. And it\u2019s certainly not a reassuring idea. Why would you hide on the pink sheets and avoid producing audited financial reports if you are seeing such success?\n\nTo underscore this, the stock has done nothing but slide lower despite the company\u2019s proclamations of ever-growing revenues. Smoke equals fire. We would simply be careful with any company that seems to overpromise and overhype, and then claim the opaque lack of transparency afforded to companies trading on the pink sheets. While we have seen a recent spike following news that Aurora bought out a CBD name (CBD is the main focus of MJNA), we would remain skeptical that the long history here of underperformance in MJNA is likely to change on a sustained basis anytime soon.\n\nMedical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) bills itself as an investment holding company that operates in the medical marijuana and industrial hemp markets. Its products range from patented and proprietary based cannabinoid products to seed and stalk or isolated high value extracts manufactured and formulated for the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical industries. The company licenses its proprietary testing, genetics, labeling and packaging, tracking, production, and standardization methods for the medicinal cannabinoid industry.\n\nIt engages in the research and development of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals; and marketing and distribution of cannabidiol hemp oil-based products. In addition, the company provides management support and services to cooperatives, collectives, health and wellness facilities, and medical clinics; and consulting and securities services to businesses and individuals in the legal cannabis industry.\n\nIt\u2019s subsidiary, Kannaway, is a network sales and marketing company specializing in the sales and marketing of hemp-based botanical products. Kannaway currently hosts weekly online sales meetings and conferences across the United States, offering unique insight and opportunity to sales professionals who are desirous of becoming successful leaders in the sale and marketing of hemp-based botanical products.\n\nMJNA has been acting well over recent days, up something like 30% in that time. Shares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 75% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nMedical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) managed to rope in revenues totaling $16.9M in overall sales during the company\u2019s most recently reported quarterly financial data \u2014 a figure that represents a rate of top line growth of -4.2%, as compared to year-ago data in comparable terms. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($6.2M against $11M, respectively).\n\n**Cresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF)** continues to act like a new leader in the making, with an expanding footprint in terms of market density and geographic range.\n\nMoreover, this is a company very much tied to the process of gradual legalization in the US marketplace, with a widely known brand and a growing scale in terms of distribution relationships.\n\nCresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) trumpets itself as a company that manufactures and sells medical cannabis products in the United States. It offers cannabis dry flower; vaporizer forms of cannabis; cannabis oil in capsule, oral and sublingual solutions; cannabis in topical; and other cannabis products.\n\nThe company also provides cannabis infused edibles, including chocolate and toffee confections, fruit-forward gummies, and hard sweet and chews. Cresco Labs Inc. sells its products under the Cresco brand. In addition, it operators a Hope Heal Health dispensary in Fall River, Bristol County, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you\u2019re long this stock, then you\u2019re liking how the stock has responded to the announcement. CRLBF shares have been moving higher over the past week overall, pushing about 8% to the upside on above average trading volume. Shares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 24% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nCresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) generated sales of $54.6M, according to information released in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of 14.2% on the top line. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($70.2M against $194.7M, respectively).\n\n**MCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC)**, now doing business as Cannabis Global, Inc. (MCTC), has started to emerge as a new focus point for cannabis stock traders in the past few weeks. The company has been an IP leader, with a number of major patents related primarily to infusion technology for CBD, THC, CBG, and THC-V in the works. It\u2019s rare to see substantive IP as a factor in the pot stock space \u2013 most of these names are basically commodity plays \u2013 but MCTC appears to be the genuine item on that note.\n\nTo help reinforce that idea, the company just announced it has completed product development and has begun distribution of its unique tetrahydrocannabivarin (THC-V) coffee and tea products to product beta testers. This comes on the heels of news that the company has been approved as an Amazon.com platform seller for its Hemp You Can Feel branded line of CBD products.\n\nAccording to the release, \u201cCannabis Global has integrated three internally developed technologies into the unique manufacturing process for the industry\u2019s first THC-V beverages. The first of these is the process developed by the Company to produce 70%+ loaded THC-V, controlled release, nanoparticles utilizing laboratory-based, pharmaceutical-grade production equipment. The Company is also utilizing both its internally developed powerization and one step dosing system, ensuring precise dosing and significantly faster production. The Company has filed provisional patents on all three technologies.\u201d\n\nAs noted, Cannabis Global (OTCMKTS:MCTC) has recently filed six patents on cannabinoid extraction technologies and delivery systems. Management is currently working with patent counsel to protect various other technologies it has developed or is currently developing, including its programs pertaining to cannabinoid glycosides, polymeric cannabinoid nanoparticles and nanofibers, and its hemp extract-based alcohol replacement technologies.\n\n\u201cOur unique infusion and production technologies provide Cannabis Global with a product purity advantage as well as a clear path to low cost leadership,\u201d commented CEO Arman Tabatabaei. \u201cThe THC-V cannabinoids are synthesized and entirely free of impurities. While there were some upfront technology development and intellectual property protection costs, we expect our ongoing variable production costs to be less than half of any potential competitor. Via our technologies, we turn one of the cannabis industry\u2019s most expensive items \u2013 pure THC-V cannabinoids \u2013 into a cost-effective solution that sets a new standard for product purity in the cannabinoid-based products marketplace.\u201d\n\nMCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC) had no reported sales in its last quarterly financial data. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($157K against $1.5M, respectively).\n\n**Curaleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF)** shares have been moving steadily higher as the company continues to expand and solidify itself as one of the primary leaders in the space, particularly in the US market.\n\nCURLF shares pushed above their key 200-day simple moving average line two weeks ago, and have held up above that key technical marker on a closing basis since, with two critical tests, both passed nicely thus far. At this point, all of the stock\u2019s major MA\u2019s are curving into a bullish posture on a long-term basis.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF) promulgates itself as a company that operates as an integrated medical and wellness cannabis operator in the United States. The Company is the parent of Curaleaf, Inc., a leading vertically integrated cannabis operator in the United States. Headquartered in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Curaleaf, Inc. has a presence in 12 states.\n\nCuraleaf, Inc. operates 30 dispensaries, 12 cultivation sites and 9 processing sites with a focus on highly populated, limited license states, including Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Curaleaf, Inc. leverages its extensive research and development capabilities to distribute cannabis products in multiple formats with the highest standard for safety, effectiveness, consistent quality and customer care. Curaleaf is committed to being the industry\u2019s leading resource in education and advancement through research and advocacy.\n\nCuraleaf Inc.\u2019s Florida operations were the first in the cannabis industry to receive the Safe Quality Food certification under the Global Food Safety Initiative, setting a new standard of excellence. It cultivates, processes, markets, and/or dispenses a range of cannabis products in various operating markets, including flower, pre-rolls and flower pods, dry-herb vaporizer cartridges, concentrates for vaporizing, concentrates for dabbing, tinctures, lozenges, capsules, and edibles.\n\nShares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 26% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF) generated sales of $129.8M, according to information released in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of 30.3% on the top line. In addition, the company has a strong balance sheet, with cash levels far exceeding current liabilities ($251M against $177.1M).",
