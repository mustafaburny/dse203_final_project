        "selftext": "Good morning from London fellow value investors.\n\nHope you're all keeping good (and had a nice bank holiday if you're in the US) \ud83d\ude04.\n\nI have three questions, and would really appreciate your opinions/insights. (I am a law student - not a finance). Tell me if I what I am saying makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***(1) Using the average S&amp;P 500 return as my discount rate.***\n\n  \\--- The discount rate, theoretically, is a measure of opportunity cost. As I understand it, the \"traditional\" approach is the risk-free rate (which would have been the 10 year treasury rate). For me, and I intend to be invested for the long-term, I regard the index as risk-free. There will be recessions and declines, but if you're invested in the ling-term; you can ride them out. In my head, it makes sense for me to use [the S&amp;P 500 average 50 years (1971-2020) return is 10.9% . Inflation adjusted is 6.8%](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/).\n\n\\--- **Question**: Does that sound right to you? If so, should I use the inflation adjusted or the nominal return? I think I should use the nominal because the average return is a calculation of each individual year? Am I right about that?\n\n***(2) Using the margin of safety to account for my risk premium as opposed to discount rate.***\n\n\\--- The book I am reading says that the discount rate should have an imbedded \"risk premium\" in the calculation.  But as a value investor, that's what the margin of safety is about, right?  In my head, the discount rate is basically me saying \"if I have the ability to invest my capital at, let's say, 10% elsewhere; what is this business worth to me?\". I then think about risk separately as a hedge in case I misjudge the business future economics, or as  windage-factor against  confirmation bias/overconfidence etc... And, demand 30%-50% depending on the upside-and-downside and my own estimation. In my mind, I don\u2019t really want to compensate for risk by increasing the discount rate. If I don't think I can intuit/infer the future free cash flows, then just pass.\n\n \\--- **Question**: How does that sound? What is your minimum margin? Do you think it's good to have one?\n\n***(3) I am having some trouble with WACC &amp; CAPM. Need some help here.***\n\n\\---- I think I understand the logic behind WACC but I don't think I get how or why it is valuable to me. I appreciate the logic of discounting the free cash flow at the weighted average cost of capital. Growth in the business will have to be funded by capital through either debt or equity. That makes sense but why should I accept a cost of debt and/or equity that is ultimately decided by the market? In basic terms, I don't really understand why I would look to the market - in terms of either the risk premium allotted to the company by the bond market, or the beta. Everyone talks about how past performance is no reliable indictor of future performance, and yet historical price volatility is meant to reflect some risk in the future? \n\nI am a bit lost here and would really love to hear from people who are experts who think WACC is useful to help me see what I am missing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said, I am doing a lot of reading but I'm coming from a non-financial background.\n\nThank you all for your time. \ud83d\ude0a",

        "selftext": "This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence.

        "selftext": "The proposal, called the Stock Buyback Accountability Act, would levy a 2% excise tax on the amount corporations spend to buy back their own stock\u2014a common practice that returns funds to shareholders without generally requiring taxes. \n\nIn recent decades, cash-rich companies have used buybacks to reward stockholders and share-incented employees. Apple (ticker: APPL) spent over $400 billion on buybacks in the last 10 years, while Microsoft (MSFT) spent nearly $130 billion. Since 2017, annual spending on buybacks by companies in the S&amp;P 500 index totaled $650 billion each year, on average, according to an Aug. 6 report by J.P. Morgan quant analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. Some 20% to 30% of those buybacks were funded with debt\u2014the rest with corporate cash.\n\nBrown and Wyden said the 2% excise tax would make corporations think twice about allocating capital to buybacks, instead of hiring or capital investment. Spending by the S&amp;P 500 companies on buybacks rose 11% from this year\u2019s March to June quarters, said J.P. Morgan\u2019s Lakos-Bujas. Capital expenditures rose 6%.

        "selftext": "\nThis journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.\n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high. I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices. Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\nThis was yesterday, Friday, September 3. \n\n$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\nAm I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!! \n\nFor fucks sake people, THIS IS HUGE!! This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to read\u2026 I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. I\u2019m actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally read\u2026I wish I was joking. Whatever\u2026weird. \n\nGross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026\n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\nSo investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nThe lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\nThey reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you. \n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\nLet me be clear\u2026I personally don\u2019t believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I don\u2019t want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do I\u2019ll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. \n\nSince the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\nShort term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\nLong term: \n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp.

        "selftext": "The IAA has been open for the last 4 days, but I hadn\u2019t been able to properly experience the MicroVision booth until now. I didn\u2019t want to distract Sumit Sharma, Dr. Luce, and the other 3 MVIS staff who attended from their B2B (business to business) goals. However, today was the first day that the general public were allowed to enter the conference halls, and Dave Allen from IR gave us the green light to go visit the booth.\n\nWhen I arrived at the booth with /u/MusicMaleficent5870, Sumit and Dr. Luce were nowhere in sight. We nevertheless decided to go in and speak to the MVIS staff. I personally spoke with Jonathan C (who I believe is the Director of Digital Engineering, thx Linkedin stalking). Jonathan walked me through the booth while MM5870 kept the other two MVIS staff members occupied. I introduced myself as a moderator of reddit and handed him my gag card..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ gag business card ](https://preview.redd.it/2zfx6lvzukm71.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8d919fd1ec5803c6f78d7c5c186b60c299b19b9)\n\n# Live Lidar Demo\n\nAn important note Jonathan mentioned was that two A-Samples were actively scanning the booth. One directly above the live demo screens (that sits on the *in*famous block of wood which I couldn\u2019t see even at a relative far distance), and one directly across from that in the back right hand corner.\n\nThe point of having two Lidars actively scanning is to showcase MicroVision\u2019s proprietary active scan lock architecture which allows the A-Sample to actively block out 99% of outside interference (as communicated to shareholders on multiple occasions in past earnings calls). As per past earnings calls the active scan lock architecture is based on proprietary technologies proven in their applications used in the Hololens 2.\n\nIn short, the Active Scan lock synchronizes the \u201csend\u201d and \u201creceiving\u201d side of the Gen 5 MEMS just as the Hololens 2 displays are sync\u2019d for the left and right eyes to prevent ocular discomfort (Sumit used a word I didn't recognize to describe that if the left eye and right eye images dont line up you get discomfort. I don\u2019t have education or background in this so could barely keep up). Each Lidar sensor is encoded its own laser signals and excludes interference even from similar identical units.\n\nFor example that if you were stuck in an intersection with 20 cars, each with their own set of short-range lidar (SRL), mid-range lidar (MRL), and long-range lidar (LRL). The IR light pollution and interference will overwhelm other sensors that do not have this feature that MicroVision owns IP for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ The second A-Sample live scanning acting as \\\\\"interference\\\\\" above the television which is showing the 1.8M Long Range Point Cloud. ](https://preview.redd.it/ien6mkf1vkm71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cb12842300f04b56ebe7c9fd7577c29351b7307)\n\nIt was explained to me that there is a filter on the live lidar demo. The filter removes the reflection of the floor for aesthetic reasons. They said that if they kept the floor in the final image, you would have been overwhelmed by extra data, but by removing them, the live stream data can be more easily interpreted. Additionally, there are indoor Class 1 EU regs that I believe are in play which made MVIS sandbag their sensor a bit (if anyone was noticing it isn\u2019t as sharp). Sumit says once all testing and certification is done there shouldn\u2019t be any issues seen specifically in the demo booth unit.\n\nThis is also a phenomenon you will notice in future Lidar demos, because the lidar sensor acts similar to the human eye does when it sees a mirage. There is a critical angle after which, the light seems to bounce to infinity. Therefore, the sensor will not return images of the road surface (due to it being a planar surface). All content which is 3 dimensional continues to be detected until the full range as advertised.\n\n# Elvis has Entered the Booth\n\nDuring the middle of conversation with Jonathan, I noticed Sumit and Dr Luce exiting from a meeting room behind the booth with an unidentified gentleman. They had obviously finished a meeting, and one of the helpers came out to return the A-Sample and the Gen 5 mems mirror back into the display (they were not there when we arrived).\n\nSumit walked over, I introduced myself as \u201cJay\u201d and he replied \u201cJay, nice to finally meet you, I\u2019ve been waiting for you all day!\u201d We arrived approximately 45 minutes before closing and I had been with Jonathan for approximately 15 minutes. Additionally, I had told Dave Allen I\u2019d try to swing by later in the afternoon, so I expect Sumit knew we were coming to visit eventually.\n\nSumit then whisked /u/MusicMaleficent5870 and I away toward the live lidar demo to start our proper tour.\n\n# The MicroVision A-Sample\n\nSumit asked us what our backgrounds were to get a grasp of our level of technical knowledge. Suffice it to say, we communicated that it was low lol. One of the biggest things Sumit wanted us to walk away with was the story he was trying to convey to investors. The specific story for investors to recognizing the true value of MicroVision\u2019s IP. The other story he\u2019s trying to convey is the inevitability for customers (from my interpretation of his explanation).\n\nTo give you an example, he spoke briefly about the Hololens 2 and Microsoft. Microsoft spent *years* trying to improve the display of the Hololens 2. It got to the point where they finally realized Microsoft could not achieve it alone (even with a group of ex-MVIS engineers on their engineer team \u2013 this is my addition for color). Alex Kipman himself mentions this in one of his talks in Zurich/digital streams in 2020. Microsoft eventually had to approach MicroVision to get the job done because of MicroVision\u2019s proprietary technology that they\u2019ve built in the past couple of decades. He also believes that **they would have never won that $22 Billion Dollar contract without them** (which I agree with. The Hololens 1 was head-to-head with Magic Leap which ate the dust after the Hololens 2 was released).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Microsoft's \\\\\"$22 Billion Dollar Contract\\\\\" ](https://preview.redd.it/5s1r48a5vkm71.jpg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdaec6c00acd3bc87406771b920045079ea5bb43)\n\nThis story of inevitability is what customers are starting to realize. If you want the best technology that solves your problems rather than creating further problems, you need to use MicroVision technology and IP (their family jewels). Their custom ASICs (which is available in a digital form) is one of the biggest advantages over competitors in the L2 and L2++ field like Tesla and Mobileye with their Camera only Neural Networks.\n\nSumit started to go down the rabbit hole into how Neural Networks work. He wouldn\u2019t trust the safety of that technology with his family, and that we wouldn\u2019t either if we read the disclaimers and fine print for cars who use these systems. This also aligns with Mobileye\u2019s current plan in developing a secondary independent Radar + Lidar system to ensure there are true redundant safety systems for maximum passenger safety.\n\nThere is a joke Sumit likes to share from the Silicon Valley Episode \u201cHot Dog, Not Hot Dog\u201d which helped us understand where he was coming from about Neural Networks.\n\n# The Family Jewels\n\nSumit believes that the ADAS market is going to go \u201cgangbusters\u201d sooner rather than later. See the bidding war currently happening between Magna and Qualcomm over Veoneer (who IAA placed side by side in the conference with Veoneer squished in the middle).\n\nMicroVision has a lot of key advantages with their proprietary custom ASICs. The way Sumit explained it to us was it comes down to basic math and physics. They can do things with edge computing faster and quicker than anyone else with their Family Jewels. **It comes from their custom OS that is built in their chips.** While Microvision is building their ADAS Lidar Sensors from an established foundation and decade\u2019s worth of tech and IP, their friends Luminar are spending billions just to be able to do the same thing with no guarantee that they can do it better or quicker than how MVIS is doing it.\n\nLastly, one of the key praises that potential customers have been commenting on the A-Sample is how **slim in profile the A-Sample is** (Apologies for the photo, I should probably take it lower down).\n\n[ Cassette of Truth - Kanye West's \\\\\"Yeezus\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/278gj577vkm71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54eaf8c77f33d8cd7b98b594a74dc47ce23bad25)\n\n[ MicroVision A-Sample ](https://preview.redd.it/trskb249vkm71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de0bfd1d8dacce0f34aada825dab45be30581c7f)\n\nI plan to publish an album of photos sometime this week which compares the other lidars on display with MVIS\u2019 A-Sample using the \u201ccassette of truth\u201d which I have been photographing to give an idea of the size of all the Lidar sensors. From my observation, MVIS is best in class from a profile aspect, all other lidar sensors are much taller in comparison.\n\n# The Lidar Product Suite\n\nSumit Sharma wants to generate more revenue. While the Hololens 2 currently does not produce enough volume for the time being,  **he believes that will change soon** with the new Lidar Product family.\n\nSumit also shared that they were getting a lot of requests for small NREs (non-recurring engineering) about, \u201chey we already have a product for short-range Lidar for the time being, can you make something for mid-range only, or maybe long-range only?\u201d.  There was enough interest that it made sense for MicroVision perspective to produce the A-Sample which would be identical to their Dynamic View Lidar (DVL) hardware wise, but with limited features the customer require now to help generate that revenue.\n\nTheir Dynamic View Lidar is meant to be their premium/flagship lidar offering. Sumit also touched on the use case of the 905nm lasers which have a standard and secure supply chain unlike the 1550nm lasers which are either custom made or non-standard supply chains utilizing exotic materials (which Velodyne does a great job of explaining in this article: [https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/](https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/)).\n\nNot only do the lasers help MVIS scale, but with the launch of MicroVision\u2019s fifth-generation MEMS to a 200-millimeter wafer silicon they control the whole process. They own their IP, and nobody else does. This gives them the ability to manufacture it the way they want. More control for MicroVision means more stability for customers.\n\n# True Value\n\nI was honestly surprised how in tune Sumit was to investors. He is also very aware of trader activity, but that is out of his hands. He\u2019s here to get true value for MVIS long investors and the multiplier/upside is massive in his eyes.\n\nI came away from the 30minute discussion in awe to be honest. There was so much content packed into that meeting, and Sumit was exuding nothing but confidence. If there are any German investors in Munich, make sure you go visit the booth, it\u2019s an excellent opportunity to share in the excitement and bullishness Sumit is currently feeling.\n\nGLTALs, it's 3:30am and i'm going to bed.\n\nTLDR - bullish",

It is an actual product that they are track testing and showing off at the IAA Mobility Conference in Germany. Look at the live demo they have up vs. our competitors: \n\n* Luminars Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/c8v23x](https://streamable.com/c8v23x)\n* Continental Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/gyee85](https://streamable.com/gyee85)\n* Velodyne Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/lhtsw2](https://streamable.com/lhtsw2)\n* Microvision Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/paywxe](https://streamable.com/paywxe)\n\nAs you can see by the point cloud and refresh rate MVIS sure looks best in class. MVIS is currently on the path of scaling for production and looking for partners.\n\nMarket Size - The global lidar market size is projected to reach **$6.77 Billion by 2026** and virtually every car company is investing/looking to utilize Lidar in the future for assisted and automated driving. It could be in every new vehicle. Luminar (LAZR) the inferior product as you can easily see by the videos above IPO'd last year with a market cap of $8.1 Billion.\n\n**AR/VR** \\- Microvision produces the MEMS Laser Beam Scanning display engine found in the Microsoft Hololens 2. It was confirmed through a tear down before and just officially via MVIS's last ASM. Also, since Microsoft produces the IVAS (rugged Hololens 2 for military use) it is highly speculated that MVIS is the engine inside that also.  \n\nMarket Size - According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), \u201cGlobal AR and VR Market information By Technology, By Component, By Device Type and Vertical - Forecast till 2027\u201d the market to reach **USD 766 billion by 2025.** Also, Microsoft just won an army contract this year **worth up to $21.9 Billion.** \n\nGoogle the Hololens 2 or IVAS units to see all the cool futuristic shit they can do. I'm not gonna spoon feed you everything.\n\n**Stock Info**\n\nCurrent Market Cap = $2.24 Billion\n\n52 Week High = $28\n\n52 Week Low = $1.38\n\nEstimated Short Interest = 29.75m or 18.29% of FF\n\n Q2 2021 shares held by institutions: **42,174,027 (25.7%)** \n\n**Summary**\n\nSince Sumit Sharma took over as CEO he continues to deliver on his promise to increase shareholder value. The company is open for a buyout, strategic alternative, or going it alone with it's amazing technology. Whatever will be the best route to **INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE**. At it's current share price we are way **UNDERVALUED.** There is more DD out there on the technologies, different verticals, and how we are at an inflection point for these things to pop. Go look at the MVIS subreddit and the meta thread there of DD I can't link.",

We'll ol' Cbass is here to welcome you to this *definitely-not-a-cult* group of investors who are, throughout the internet, highly **R**egarded for **E**xcellence, **T**houghtfulness, **A**droitness and **R**espectably **D**istinguished **E**loquence in **D**iscourse (*occasionally* going by the acronym: **RETARDED**).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Hey everybody!

Technically Anal\n\nPart 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos\n\nPart 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy\n\nPart 4.

Technically Anal**\n\nSo this past week saw a considerable breakout of the $9 resistance wall and a concomitant FOMOing into the ticker with FD's destined to Lambo or Burn. Well those FDs are either now ash or in a giant gasoline-soaked pyre, but let's have a look at the charts to see if any of the poor bastards holding 9/17 $17 calls can be saved.\n\nFirst, a general look at the important lines:\n\n[So many lines, so much value](https://preview.redd.it/cnrsj3ehy2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95d5beb400d7024a6196736106457fd6c843879)\n\nThe most important level on here is the one I've labeled \"Launch #1\", though at this point the \"#1\" is looking smidgen unnecessary. First established on the gap-down on Oct. 6 of last year, it provided resistance on three occasions afterward (yellow arrows for the simpletons), with the last ending in a massive breakout to all-time highs.\n\nThe $9.08 line is the second most important line on the chart, in my possibly chromosome-deficient opinion. First established on Mar. 15 of this year after the bounce from all-time lows, it provided some level of resistance immediately afterward, but in the post *squeeze-that-wasn't-a-squeeze* world of the past few months it has become the ultimate resistance, a titanic, 700-foot wall of ice and sorrow towering over the pitiable bag holders huddling beneath its monstrously cold heights. Before this week, there were three prior attempts so surmount the Wall, all ending failure.\n\nOf next and most immediate importance is the $8 mark. I have it as $7.94 as there is a small case for its origin story beginning on Mar. 25 of this year. However, like the $9 mark, its true importance has been found recently, and ***cannot be overstated***: This line, however pitiful, represents a **higher low** and thus holding that line is of critical importance for the prospects of any near-term upward action.\n\nThe orange downtrend line was the last of the downtrend lines, and crossing it resulted in the most recent attempt at the Wall of $9.\n\nThe green line is **the bottom**, a place of green pastures and buxom women, where the burdens of your bags will vanish away . . . because you've passed from this world and its worries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext is a chart looking at the $11.13 mark:\n\n[Fibonacci, because Italian people](https://preview.redd.it/86tdxc76z2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b1f1e37ef85a53788c7100bddb17f9d64889a2)\n\nAs shown, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $11.13 is shaping up to be a very important line. Indeed, it is soon to over shadow the $11.80 breakout line in that regard. On the dump following the June push, the ticker found support at $11.16 on Jun. 21, and subsequently it opened and dumped down from that level on a Jul. 6 (yellow arrows for simpletons). And just this week we saw the ticker reach up to **exactly** $11.13, before getting summarily thrown back off the top of the Wall. At this point, I think a breakout of $11.13 probably results in a significant push up. But we're getting well ahead of ourselves with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a TA wunderkind, I've turned my head to just the right angle and found a sliver of hope for the hopeless Men of the Watch:\n\n[Two girls &amp; a cup: can't possibly fail](https://preview.redd.it/ary603egz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e5b5f27b60656be73760dee5251e0e1d79e6b8)\n\nThe good news is it looks like a cup &amp; handle formation. The bad news is that *usually* a cup &amp; handle is a pause in an uptrend. Here, however, you have a downtrend into the cup (the giant pink arrow for the simpletons). This is a great example of Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart &amp; indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear. So, let's just call this a positive, because we have little else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at 1hr chart, let's see if we can find some more copium:\n\n[I see Higher Lows from my house!](https://preview.redd.it/dyaiz8hnz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f6ec421727eeedc62a68c18d33c86a25cd03e9d)\n\nAfter the post earnings dump, CLOV briefly had a breakdown below the $8 support before rallying back up to test the $9 Wall, repeatedly. In that time, it found itself in a new channel between $8.40 and $8.60, thus establishing $8.40 as a **new, higher low**. This, as much as the Great YOLO Brigade of Labor Day Weekend, was the cause of the breakout on Tuesday. Basically, the chart was screaming that a breakout was incoming, YOLO brigade be damned.\n\nThe copium for next week is whether or not another higher low can be put in at $8.60. Like any good Man of the Bag Watch I have to hope it can, because if I try to leave, my portfolio gets hunted down and beheaded.\n\nThe worse and therefore more likely scenario is a breakdown all the way back to $8, undoing several weeks worth of upward progress. The absolute worst case is a *true* failure of $8 and a return to all-time lows. This would be a dagger in the heart, and unless someone knows a Red Woman, we're fucked.\n\n[Winning, winning so fuckin' hard right now](https://preview.redd.it/8zf0arxvz2n71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ff09023716e9894e0f4fd672ec56fa1d4808de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos** **^((for maximum gapping)****)**\n\nIn true Clovtard fashion, my knowledge of this company prior to purchasing shares was \"it does some techy stuff with healthcare.\" Which, it turns out, is basically all you need to know. This company is one of those that seems complex and super high-tech, but in reality is more basic bitch than your average Instagram thot. That being said, it might still work out for them... after all, do you see some of these basic bitches that blow up on Instagram? Living proof that ***literally anything*** is possible.\n\nBut just in case someone cares (and to keep the Clovtards from reeing in the comments), here's a look at the company underlying the CLOV:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Business Model***\n\n* **TL;DR: they sell insurance to old people &amp; process payment claims from doctors**\n\nClover sell two products:\n\n1. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are just insurance plans for people on Medicare that include extra services along with the Medicare stuff, and\n2. Direct Contracting (DC) plans, which are one of several alternative payment models recently put forth by CMS (the people that run Medicare)\n\nThe important difference between these is that Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan where the ***patient*** is Clover's customer and Direct Contracting is where the ***doctor*** is Clover's customer. With the latter, Clover is acting as, essentially, a *payment processor* for the doctor's Medicare patients. This allows Clover to get a sweet slice of that government largess. On the doctors' side of it, they deal with Clover instead of CMS. Supposedly the whole scheme (and this is one of five put forth by CMS in 2020) is supposed to save the government money (&gt;!it won't!&lt;). I don't give a fuck about that part; all I care about here is whether Clover can grow their slice of the pie. \n\nThis Direct Contracting scheme was a ***major selling point*** for Chamath when they went public (more on that below), and for good reason. Clover only needs to manage a single relationship (with the doctor) to grab up dozens, or potentially hundreds, of patients. This DC scheme should be (*on paper at least)* far more efficient than Clover's original business model, which was just managing MA plans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Growth***\n\n* **TL;DR: they can** ***potentially*** \\~**25x their customer base** **^((but probably much, much less))**\n\nSo other than **\"the squeeze\"**, why would anyone ***genuinely*** believe this company is going to have some astronomical valuation that would give them a stock price on par with the likes of United Healthcare? Simple: growth. \n\nRight now Clover only services MA and DC contracts in a small number of counties: 108 in 8 states. They are expected to nearly double with an additional 101 counties by the end of the year, bringing the total to 209 in 9 states. Since there are 3,000 some odd counties in the United States, there is (*on paper*) a lot of room to expand here. **This is good**.\n\nAs of their latest earnings report, they had 128,591 \"lives under management.\" (I think that is a creepy as fuck way of putting it, but I *guess* it's industry standard....) Of those, 66,566 were MA customers and the remaining 62,025 were *indirect* patients, i.e., the Medicare patients of doctors in a DC agreement with Clover. The total of \\~129,000 was a year-over-year increase of 126.3%. **This is also good**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Math time!**\n\nIn their best counties, Clover has upward of 25% market share (at least this is their *claim*); that is, they have a quarter of the MA patients signed up with them. But to assume they can do that everywhere would be absurd. To keep this ultra simple, let's just assume that their current percentage as of the last earning report is representative of what they can do. So that is 128,591 \"lives\" across 108 counties which comes to an **average of 1,190 \"lives\" per county**.  (Obviously, not all counties are the same size, but let's just use this average for simplicity's sake.) So we have:\n\n**1,190 x 3000 = 3.57 million \"lives\"**\n\n**3,570,000 / 128,591 = 27.8**\n\nSo, ***theoretically***, Clover could achieve **27.8x growth** in customers, and ***presumably*** a similar growth in revenue. (We'll get to profitability, or lack there of, below.) Looking deeper at this number, one thing going for it is that the number of old people is steadily increasing. But on the other hand, competition is a thing, and big thing in this space. To assume that Clover is going to have 3.5 million customers in 10 years, or even 20, is pretty wild..... \n\nChamath claimed Clover was the \"easiest ten bagger\" he'd ever seen (or some shit like that). So, even going with that number, they would end up with 1.3 million \"lives\" in ten years. Even this seems pretty high to me. They went from 0 to 62,025 DC patients this year, but it is ***always easier to grow when you're small***. Scaling is an issue for all businesses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Profitability***\n\n* **TL;DR: they'll make no profit for a long ass time** **^((if ever))**\n\nAs for actually making money, well Clover doesn't do that. Yes, they had a 140% increase in revenue, which is good, but their expenses are rising ***faster*** than revenue. Accordingly, they missed on earnings by -0.52, or **378% downside surprise**. In typical corporate fashion, their forward guidance is full of claims of improvement on cost management just around the corner.\n\nThere is, to be fair here, a legitimate reason for some of the cost increases in the form of covid expenses. Essentially, some old people needed extra care, while others *delayed* care until it looked safe which caused a massive spike in trips to the doctor. And when you're old and you let shit slide, it gets a lot worse and a lot more expensive.\n\nFurthermore, their basic strategy involves eating losses when they take on new \"lives under management,\" with the idea that they'll make it back, and more, further down the road with that same patient though the efficiencies of their \"A.I.\", Clover Assistant.  \n\nTaking them at their word that this works (and will continue to do so at larger scales) then it is obvious they will being eating losses for years to come. Allegedly, they'll turn a profit in 2023, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that. However, just growing their \"lives under management\" number might be enough to hold up the stock price.\n\nIt might **not** be enough, however, to keep the lights on. If they can't at least slow the bleeding, share issuances could be lurking down the road (queue the pump &amp; dump conspiracies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Competition***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have to take market share from better companies**\n\nAs noted above, the biggest hurdle in front of Clover is **competition**. Despite the \"tech start-up\" narrative surrounding Clover, the reality is that they are marching into the teeth of well-entrenched healthcare companies. \n\nThe likes of United Healthcare and Humana aren't going to take lightly to little ol' Clov rolling up in their shit. With about 10 million patients between them, UH and Humana are monsters in the Medicare space and with that comes the ability to undercut the competition. Furthermore, all these big players also have their own ***magic AI machine-learning gizmos*** that do ***magic AI things***. And they already have access to more data than Clover on account of their massive patient base. \n\nThis doesn't mean they can just snuff Clover out of existence, but taking away market share from established players is a far different gambit than expanding into a new market. And it gets harder the bigger you get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Shaddy Shit***\n\n* **TL;DR: Chamath is a shaddy af, and so is the CEO**\n\nThis whole shabang was rolled out in typical Chamath fashion. Back in October of 2020, in his pitch for Clover, he claimed they **\"already\"** had 200,000 lives under management in their **Direct Contracting program** (i.e., not including the MA patients). Except that was bullshit of the Chamath-degree. At the time he claimed this, Clover ***hadn't even started*** its DC program (it had only just been accepted into the program). \n\nAs their latest earning report notes, they don't expect to get anymore \"lives\" in their DC program until Jan. 2022. (This is due to Medicare enrollment period rules). So, rather than \"already\" having 200,000 for 2021, Clover will instead end the year with the \\~62,000 that they have right now. ***Chamath at his finest, ladies and gentlemen.***\n\nClover's top guy, Vivek, is also well-known for being shaddy. Though, in his case, I don't actually care as much. Back in the day, this guy ran three hospitals in NJ that were noteworthy for having the highest fees of any hospitals in America. Shaddy, but shaddy in the ***ruthless capitalism direction***. He gets a pass from Cbass *for this*. He is also alleged to have pilfered a company he ran back in the day. This doesn't get a pass, because it could negatively affect my bottom line. \n\nClover is the subject of two ***related*** investigations, one from DoJ and the other from the SEC. The DoJ one is about shaddy business practices; something about kickbacks. I also don't give much a fuck about this. The SEC investigation is about the fact that the DoJ investigation was not disclosed during the SPAC merger. All this will probably amount to some fines, if anything at all. \n\nOn scale of 0 to Enron, I'll give Clover a 1.5. Doesn't look that bad to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Technology***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have a magic AI app that designed to maximize** **~~health~~** ***profits*** **^((maybe))**\n\nThe last thing to mention is the Great Green Hope: the **Clover Assistant**. This is the \"tech\" in Clover and the reason dipshits are using #TelsaHealth. What is it? Well, basically a data input and analysis program. More basically: *Microsoft Excel with fancy buttons*.\n\nClover Assistant is used by the doctors (and many MA patients use it, too) to coordinate and recommend stuff. The Great Hope here is that doctors love using this thing so much that they'll sign onto a DC agreement with Clover, allowing Clover to process their Medicare payment claims in exchange for access to the \"**app**\".\n\nSo is it going to work? Well, it is ***starting*** to: Clover went from 0 to 62,000 patients via this scheme this year. It's a country fucking mile from what Chamath claimed, but ain't nothing. And given the potential for expansion into the rest of the US, and you have the receipt for a pretty damn good return on capital. But then again, it is just an \"app\".\n\nTo be clear, I don't hate the *idea* of Clover Assistant. Conceptually, I actually like it. The Clover Assistant basically helps doctors make sure their patients are getting the \"right care\" by compiling data and presenting it in an easy to use fashion. This is presented as an opportunity to \"improve outcomes\" and \"save costs\" and \"help the under-served.\" But I don't give a rat's ass about any of that.\n\nWhich brings me to the Hindenburg report, and the part about it that I ***like***. The report claims that Clover is using the Assistant to direct doctors toward medical recommendations that would result in profits for Clover (rather than the best medical outcome), and that they are incentivizing the doctors with increased payments for these outcomes. ***I love this.*** Now, Clover vehemently denies this is the case, but I (not so) secretly hope their lying here, because this is ***exactly*** what I imagine when I think of applying Big Data-A.I. and Machine Learning to healthcare.   \n\nPeople have ***blind faith*** in machines, particularly ones that they've been told are \"**A.I. powered**\" and involve \"**machine learning**\". Thus, you can use the concept of \"A.I.\" to persuade patients to just accept whatever the computer tells them. Machine learning is then used program the Clover Assistant to ***maximize profits***, which should involve providing the minimum care required to keep the patient alive as long as possible. (Medicare pays a set amount to Clover and they get to keep the extra if the patients don't use up all the funds). \n\nThe only way I could see to improve on this diabolical scheme would be if they ground up the corpses of their newly deceased patients, turned them into food and fed them to the rest of their **\"lives under management.\"** I'm lookin' for every penny here, kids, ***every single penny***.\n\n[It's made from options traders!](https://preview.redd.it/u4qd8tzo63n71.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e27a86ed516acbd906706d2e9440056b6bd90d3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy**\n\nTypical of any stock ticker that gathers a cultish following, the Clovidiots are as well-known for their conspiracy theories as they are for their options expiring worthless. Now, most of these are the run-of-mill shit you get with any ticker: the Hedgies, reeee! You would think that this is the first time some of these people had ever bought a stock... oh, wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Hedgies!!!***\n\n* **TL;DR: it's the stock market, deal with it**\n\nSo, do the \"Hedge Funds\" manipulate the stock price? Well, sure, why not. They definitely shorted it, and then managed to cover those short sales with little appreciable rise in the stock. Back in June, CLOV was at something like a 48% shorted. Now the it's 15% and I believe it got as low as 7% before this week's run up. While going from 48% to 7% short with no appreciable rise in the stock price looks impossible, it's definitely not when you considered that a large percentage of the float has been in institutional hands this whole time. Stock goes up a little, they sell and back down she goes, welcome to a regular day on the stock market.\n\nIs this some grand conspiracy of fat cats in a room smoking cigars as they plan out how to stick it to those pesky Reddit kids? ***I doubt it***, but if it makes you feel better, whatever.\n\nI, personally, would worry less about the \"Hedge Funds\" and more about the Market Makers, as they're the ones selling you the options, and if they buy up the stock beforehand, they can sell out for a profit while simultaneous vaporizing those call options you bought from them. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the game.\n\nCan anything be done about it? Well, no, not really. At least, not unless retail buys up a larger percentage of the float. However, with each false run up, I wonder if that exact process is taking place, i.e., more bagholders are being newly minted, and each, not wanting to take an L and just move on with his life, decides to become a \"diamond handed ape.\" Only time will reveal the truth of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Us vs. the World***\n\n* **TL;DR: everyone thinks this way, deal with it**\n\nThe second great conspiracy of CLOV is that the whole of the internet is out to get it. This is proffered with the full knowledge that GME-Anon and Popcorn ***both believe the same thing about their own stock.*** Both also believe that CLOV is, ***in and of itself***, a conspiracy to distract from their pet stock. But GME-Anon ***also believes*** that Popcorn is an engineered distraction. And all three are ***also*** convinced that the Mods are out to get them, ***specifically***.\n\nThis is, of course, perfectly normal behavior. That might seem shocking to some of you, but the next time you're watching football with a die hard fan (or whatever lame-ass europoor sport you watch), look for their reactions whenever the slightest thing doesn't go their way:\n\n* *\"These fucking refs are terrible! They're totally biased against my team! They've got it out for us! I'm going to write an angry letter to the league!\"*\n\nSound familiar? It should, because if you look around with open eyes, you'll find this exact behavioral pattern repeated at infinitum across every conceivable human endeavor.\n\nDo people hate CLOV and the masses of idiots holding it? Sure, and I don't blame them. You guys can be pretty fucking annoying. That does not, however, equate to a grand conspiracy of suppression. The fact that your copy-pasta DD got nixed just like everyone else's lazy dogshit copy-pasta is not you being singled out. It's you not understanding the rules and adapting your behavior to play within them. But hey, maybe it's easier to just blame the Mods.\n\n[\\(please don't ban me\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7mfo4sa0q3n71.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00e9a245357f31fe49b1cf093303f400f411d546)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 4. Rise now, a Man of the Bag Watch**\n\nHaving taken a brief tour of Castle Black and had a bit of a feel for what it's like to be a venerable Man of the Clov Bag Watch, most of you are probably thinking: *Okay, how the fuck do I get out this chickenshit operation?* \n\nWell, you are probably still hoping for **moon**. In that regard, I've some bad news for you: ***there will be no squeeze.*** \n\nThere will absolutely not be a **short squeeze****.** At 15% short, there is zero chance of this happening. *\"But, bruh, the* ***real*** *short number is like 420% bruh.\"* Bullshit. Just straight bullshit.\n\nThere is also not going to be a **gamma squeeze.** Not anytime soon, and likely never. In order to get a gamma squeeze you need options that are going to be delta-hedged. But why delta-hedge options that are going to be Thanos-snapped out of existence by expiry?\n\nA while back, it looked like there could be a **mixed squeeze** (short covering + gamma hedging), but that's all in the past now. Down the road from now, could it still happen? Yeah, sure, and I could end up raw-dogging a Victoria's Secret model on the hood of my new lambo. All kinds of crazy things are ***possible***, but that doesn't make them ***likely***.\n\nAnd honestly, what the fuck is wrong with a good ol' grind up? Squeezes are fun, I get it. You get to see your money double, triple, 5x, 10x, all in the space of a day or two. You get to see those option YOLO's gain a thousand of percent in minutes. But you still make money on a grind up. A fuckload of it.\n\nI'm not sure I buy into this whole notion of a \"squeeze\" being the **Holy Grail of the Stock Market**. It's starting to sound like the Bears and their perpetual claims that they're going to make ***all the money*** on the coming collapse, all while lighting round after round of SPY puts on fire. The Squeeze Fanatics are doing the same thing, but with call options on meme stocks. \n\nBut, hey, what do I know? I'm just peon in this operation, a pitifully small cog in the great meat grinder we call the stock market. For now the chart tells me there's still **hope of up**, and so my bag watch continues. When the chart dies and there is no more good to be said of the company, then I will initiate my Bagholder Optimization Formula and there my watch will end. Until then, I man my post.\n\n[Tormund Bearfucker](https://preview.redd.it/dpx4byfpy3n71.jpg?width=961&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55407f36e295ce5450fa607f21dfa766fc2f54c1)\n\n**Positions or Ban:**\n\n[Maybe I can try crtl-z?](https://preview.redd.it/w59n919dx3n71.jpg?width=1667&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a10ed3b8aee187ad77f3d03404586278d97e8c4)",

        "selftext": "So, Alibaba is of course the most discussed stock in the last month on this sub, I think. So I decided to discuss Tencent, instead.\n\nI think Tencent is simply incredible. Let's see why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WeChat** \n\nThey own WeChat/Weixin (Weixin is for mainland China, WeChat for everywhere else. I will call it WeChat). WeChat is.. WeChat. Mohnish pabrai calls it \"a bazooka Tencent can fire at will\". It has 1.25 billion users. What can you do on WeChat? Everything. Text, pay for stuff, play games, shop online, anything. Imagine if the following app existed:\n\n* Need something on Amazon? No problem, you can do it directly from WeChat through its mini-app.\n* Need to pay something in a shop? Use TenPay.\n* Need a ride on Uber? Use WeChat mini-app.\n* Need to order food on DoorDash? WeChat.\n\nReplace Amazon with JD, Uber with Didi, DoorDash with Meituan, and you have WeChat. \n\nWeChat is a bazooka beause, if Tencent decides to partner with someone and allows them to integrate in their ecosystem, that business will explode. It happened with Pinduoduo, which mainly works on WeChat: it grew 100% last year.\n\nSince it runs the platform, Tencent gets a commission. Also, it stores all the data that goes through these apps. In 2020, revenue from WeChat was 16.7 billion dollars, out of 74.6 billion in total. WeChat has 3.2 million mini programs on its platform, which transacted 1.6 trillion RMB (247 billion $) in 2020. To get how much this thing is growing, in 2017 it was 210 billion RMB (32b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's empire**\n\nTencent has an impressive number of businesses: they have a subscription revenue which is 62% that of Netflix; a media ads business (bigger than the Nyt), games, cloud, mobile payment services. Their business is so wide it is hard to navigate. Some examples:\n\n1. **Gaming**: Tencent has around 50% of market share in China in the mobile gaming industry. In 2020 they made 29.3 billions from games. In 2021 it is probably going to be lower. Online gaming industry in 2020 was 58b, it is expected to grow to 86b in 2027. Mobile gaming is projected to be 70% of the online gaming market in China by then.\n2. **TenPay**: There are two ways to pay for stuff in China: TenPay and AliPay. While in the West switched from cash to cards, and are still in transition, China has skipped a step and went directly to mobile payments. In 2018 already, a walloping 83% of all payments in China were made through mobile. Now it is around 90%. Cards are useless, in China: they account for less than 5% of payments. In the Western world, Google pay and Apple Pay are only now eroding the empire of Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. China, on the other hand, was to Tencent and Alibaba like a smooth field: they just took over. Apple pay now has around 500 million users world-wide. Tencent has 900 millions. From the last financial report, Tencent shows that revenue of the financial technology and corporate services business increased by 40% year-on-year to RMB 41.9 billion (6. billions). China's mobile payment market is projected to reach 88.4 Billion usd by the year 2027, trailing a CAGR of 47.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's fantastic portfolio**:\n\nBefore you do a cf analysis of Tencent, you need to know that Tencent has a portfolio that is currently valued around 250 billions usd at present. It is like a financial version of Cthulhu, with tentacles everywhere. It is quite hard to navigate/find information about it. They say they are currently invested in over 700 companies, of which only 103 are publicly traded. This guy has put up a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owpL6WmMK30X19Kw3BziAw39rGJbsfIMOOexdtvAkxU/edit) for you that tracks the most notable public ones.\n\nSome notable busineness Tencent owns (percentages might not be accurate):\n\na) Gaming:\n\n* 100% Riot Games (League of Legends)\n* 40% Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* 81.4% Supercell (Clash of Clans)\n* 10% BlueHole (PUBG)\n* 80% Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile)\n* 5% Activision Blizzard.\n* 20% Kingsoft (gaming competitor in China &amp; cloud business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Finance:\n\n* 30% Webank (biggest online bank in China)\n* 2%? Khatabook (digital payments in India)\n* 25% Gojek (same in Indonesia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Social:\n\n* 50.1% Huya (twitch-like)\n* 38% Douyu (twitch-like)\n* 12% Snapchat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) Music:\n\n* 58% Tencent music\n* 6.8% Spotify\n* 10% Universal music group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) E-commerce:\n\n* 25% Sea ltd (which also makes games, does mobile payments etc)\n* 18% JD\n* 17% Pinduodo\n* 7% Vipshop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf) Other\n\n* 20% Meituan (Doordash of China)\n* 15% Nio (ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Valuation**\n\nHow do you value Tencent? Currently, Tencent has a market cap of 619.72b, with a P/E of 24 and P/fcf (trailing 12 months) of 22 (Do not forget the investment portfolio, as well). fcf grew 29.4% a year in the last 10 years. Tencent has Microsoft-style profit margins of 35%. Revenue is growing at more than 30% a year, which is insane for a company this size. With its impressive portfolio, Tencent is poised to have a leading role in a country that is growing it GDP at 7%, that soon will catch up with the US, and where around 500 million people are projected to reach middle class in the next 10 years, something which will benefit tech companies the most. Of course, the risks are China regulations, in particular its anti-monopoly campaign; China in general: VIE structure, accounting standards etc. Here is an earnings based model, but take it with a grain of salt. \n\nDiscount rate: 14%. Based on eps without nri. 20 years.\n\n* Best scenario (20%): year 1-10: 25% growth, y 10-20: 10%. Value: 112.13\n* Normal scenario (60%): y1-10: 18%; y10-20: 10%. Value: 70.38\n* Worst scenario (20%): y1-10: 15%. y10-20: 8%. Value: 55.27\n* Fair value: 75.7\n* current price: 64.56. Undervalued by 17.25 % for a 14% return.  \n\n\nOf course it's all about assumptions. If you raise margin of safety, cut down growth estimates etc, you will get a very different number. I think I used a fairly conservative growth estimate, though. I personally think the upside for Tencent is insane., even though it is a behemoth already. It is one of my strongest buys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might consider doing a separate post about the risks of investing in Tencent: China regulations etc. For now.. thanks for reading!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider](https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) &amp; [gurufocus.com/](https://gurufocus.com/)\n\n[https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/](https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/)\n\n[https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/](https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/)\n\n[https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf](https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf)\n\n[https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html](https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html)\n\n[https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020](https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020)",

It will be the Greatest Speculative Bubble of All Time in All Things \u2013 [Michael Burry](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-has-found-the-next-market-bubble.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is Passive Investment Actively Hurting the Economy? - [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-passive-investment-actively-hurting-the-economy)\n\nBut at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week\u2019s issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \\[1\\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!\n\n**The Problem**\n\nThe argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)\n\nIf you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes\n\n**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**\n\nThe problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)\n\nIf you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \\[2,3\\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.\n\nAdding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it\u2019s something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it\u2019s not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\\[4\\].\n\nNow that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder\n\n**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**\n\nI believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)\n\nThe above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).\n\nFinally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.\n\n**Alternatives to index funds**\n\nWhile researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.\n\nAs of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN &amp; FB) account for more than 23% of the S&amp;P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.\n\nThere are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation\n\n[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&amp;P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)\n\n[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&amp;P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!\n\nWhile the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!\n\nUntil next week :)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (&gt;90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!\n\n\\[2\\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing\u2019s efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.\n\n\\[3\\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.\n\n\\[4\\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other.",

I am a salesperson at a Large FCA Store (Stellantis) Dealership in the midwest, and we are sitting on less vehicles today for sale in September, 2021 than we had in July, 2021. \n\n**Ram trucks factories are shut down right now.

Everything that requires a button in your car, fire stick remote controller, xbox controller, keyboard etc... requires a semi conductor.\n\nThe problem with the vehicle shortage is that the vehicle manufactures planned to schedule less chips in February 2021 for the vehicles of 2021 sales. They thought they would sell less vehicles this year because of the Covid, however, earlier this year, things opened and mask came off.  The car manufactures decided to instead order the same amount of chips as they usually do yearly, but the orders were already booked for other manufactures that needed chips. This is why you dont see a shortage in Smart phones, and computers, or TVS. The chip factories are producing chips for them first now before they can produce for car manufactures. It isn't because of a covid factory shut down...\n\nThis gives me reason to believe that demand will only increase for Semi Conductors and since TSM holds the most market in this area and they can generally control pricing. \n\nThis shows that the demand of current electrical devices int he world is actually far greater than we expected!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolid LongTerm Lifetime investment company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*At todays share price on September 3rd, 2021*\n\n*The P/E Ratio of TSM is 32X* \n\n*Apple P/E Ratio is 29X*\n\n*Microsoft P/E ratio is 37X*\n\n*Tesla P/E ratio is 170X*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Average analyst target of $147/share.*\n\nHigh of $200 and Low of $105\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n TSMC formed in 1987, located HQ in Hsinchu, Taiwan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xnxfeghadl71.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=439f443755a78bf1d3196f0dbf40094a440d3308\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1on5sfgiadl71.jpg?width=881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daec6d79172b837788407a8a9aa424e314dc045c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyjqrmekadl71.jpg?width=280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d23b13907924b9618d8f9def091308fbe0b0227\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dm7llfz59dl71.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0f312c9e543ffed4b23af9e395ced2ee39513dd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5o61y339dl71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b523709807728fb9e2e3493a8049ab218f24da6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/um88hin29dl71.jpg?width=1504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5552a028558c76441675d3bec3cedb4a722e5cd1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wv6gsi509dl71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f984f64edabdb85ef83e3ae665395b55e299a0b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwgxhayfcdl71.jpg?width=2119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a610a0371e7d27e6506ddec9a2f3ffbdea533bd2\n\nToday i bought 100 calls, (2 days after earnings) purchase and am expecting more long term purchased investments into this company.

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. \n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.\n\nWhich brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.\n\nHere's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)\n\nUnless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.\n\nAnother thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&amp;A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.\n\nI'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6jpncvw6dm71.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a7eca7bafa3737ba33fe74f0f222748a3175370",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nMy main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.\n\nI am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. \n\nI back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.\n\n[Back Testing Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=22&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=AAPL&amp;allocation1_1=20&amp;symbol2=AMZN&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;symbol3=GOOGL&amp;allocation3_1=20&amp;symbol4=MSFT&amp;allocation4_1=20&amp;symbol5=TSLA&amp;allocation5_1=20)",

I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months\u2026\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs\u2026however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid\u2026.\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be\u2026however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially\u2026.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "When I started trading I was trying to follow the mantra of \"don't invest more than you're willing to lose.\" This resulted in sort of a max of $400-500 that I would put in per individual stock and I definitely had too many going at once to see any legit profit. \n\nI have also read that I should have specific rules set and follow them, setting emotions aside. With this, I have set my initial investment around $1-2K as well as buying puts to hedge potential drops and/or setting Stop Limits for a % I would be willing to lose. My goal is to hit around a 20-30% ROI before selling. There are a few I plan to just buy and Hold, but others I would like to swing trade over the span of a few months. \n\nThe more I think about it, wouldn't it be better to put far more (10-20K) into a stock that is very likely to increase in value over time, like blue chip stocks - wait for it to drop to a 20-50 day MA, invest and look to get out when that 20% is hit. \n\nBut you can't time the market! I know, I know but stocks like MSFT, AAPL, JNJ, PG and many others aren't likely to just drop to 0 even if they do have a pullback (which is when I would buy). Plus, I would have purchased a Put and/or set a stop loss with what I'm comfortable losing. \n\nHow hard do you all go in on your initial investment and do you really need to up the ante to see consistently high returns?

        "selftext": "If you\u2019ve been following Reddit and Twitter from last week, CCJ has been one of the most talked about tickers, and rightfully so as the stock is up 60% in one month and 15% just last week. Interestingly enough, on Friday the stock price closed at the area with the most Gamma Exposure (GEX) at $25 per share.\n\nPersonally, I like Uranium as a long-term hold, but this price action deserves some paying attention to and potentially taking some profits off the table.\n\nFor those of you that don\u2019t remember or haven\u2019t read some of my other posts. Here\u2019s a description of the boxes/zones I\u2019ve overlaid on the chart.\n\n* Red Zone = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play.\n* Orange Zone = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone.\n* Green Zone = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn1o5yokj5n71.png?width=2402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10b78c2e46eaccdd27af17e68cf7f09d2c0afc04\n\nOf course, these zones are very easy to notice after-the-fact. Going into June CCJ would have looked to have been on a steady up-trend and buying any dips earlier this year along the way would have netted some nice returns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll be keeping an eye on CCJ next week to see what happens with this squeeze or if it reverts back to the mean. Entering a new position here and chasing FOMO is extremely risky. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on this if it goes back into the low $20\u2019s to enter another position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s look at my short-list of \u201cbuy the dip\u201d stocks this week.\n\n# The BTFD (Buy The F\u2019n Dip) List\n\n**Ametek (AME)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38dkmfhlj5n71.png?width=2404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803267ccea4bfeade96c1570d09223ce3802b60b\n\nIf you don\u2019t know about Ametek then all you need to know is that it is a beast of a company. Strong fundamentals, strong business model, and is nicknamed the \u201cniche acquirer\u201d from their strategic list of acquisitions. AME is typically a very slow moving stock, similar to Microsoft, but if you zoom the chart out over a couple years you\u2019ll see this thing only goes up. The very small dip recently might prove to be a good entry point if you\u2019ve been waiting to get in for some time. Ex-dividend date is also tomorrow. So I would expect this to be slightly green, if the market permits, to make up for the div.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Salesforce (CRM)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahl11f3mj5n71.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4049d6c64e87d0f805682ad8fbbc9aff60e17492\n\nAnother long-term stock for my portfolio. CRM saw some tailwinds early on during Covid, but over the last 12 months the stock price has stalled. In my opinion last week\u2019s dip could be a good entry. The $250 level, which was previously resistance, might also be a good support zone to enter. Keep an eye on the 50 EMA which it was been bouncing off during this recent uptrend since May.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The MEME List\n\nThe \u201cmeme\u201d list isn\u2019t necessarily meme stocks, but it\u2019s what I refer to when I\u2019m talking about stocks that have potential to trend on social media, or they are generally higher-risk growth-stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2s81jromj5n71.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4895c9ae388d2f7562af1729e44a6b28ad646d65\n\nSquare, which saw insane growth through Covid, has somewhat lost it\u2019s momentum. This 10% dip over the last several weeks gives it a better entry than at $275 when it was a slightly over-extended. RSI hitting over-sold and volume profile sitting right at the shelf where trading volume thins out. IMO this is a quality name to own for the long-term and although the stock is up a lot in the last 6 months, today offers a better entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**D-Local (DLO)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jr0aanhnj5n71.png?width=2398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8608a6c86738b337ced80d2f1ca7a817fb7ca44\n\nYou don\u2019t see this name around Reddit too much, but I think it deserves to get on most people\u2019s radar. DLO is a payment processor for Latin America, and 3rd world/emerging markets. The growth they are experiencing is over 100% YoY, which drove the stock price +30% on earnings in August. Since then it\u2019s had about a month\u2019s worth of consolidation at the $65 level. I think here at $62 provides an \u201corange box\u201d entry which I am willing to take a risk at. Ideally I would have liked to enter in the $50\u2019s, but that\u2019s what investing is all about, finding ideal risk-to-reward opportunities.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone. Happy Saturday and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months\u2026\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs\u2026however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid\u2026.\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be\u2026however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially\u2026.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.",

I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.\n\nWhich brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.\n\nHere's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)\n\nHere are my positions: [https://i.imgur.com/5s6tFfe.png](https://i.imgur.com/5s6tFfe.png)\n\nUnless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.\n\nAnother thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&amp;A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.\n\nI'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 13th, 2021.\n\n# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve\u2019s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.\n*****\n&gt; Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed\u2019s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed\u2019s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.\n*****\n&gt; # Hot CPI\n&gt; \u201cIf the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August\u2019s producer price index \u2014 which was released Friday \u2014 showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August\u2019s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cCertainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it\u2019s an issue for the bond market if it\u2019s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,\u201d CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf markets have an inflation mutiny here and there\u2019s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,\u201d Donabedian said of the Fed\u2019s taper announcement. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Stagflation?\n&gt; That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August\u2019s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m more about the \u2018flation\u2019 side of it than the \u2018stag.\u2019 I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,\u201d Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a \u201cshort-term warning.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It\u2019s really settled down now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you\u2019re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you\u2019re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There\u2019s income there for consumers to spend. We\u2019re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn\u2019t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn\u2019t call it stagflation.\u201d\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tjC3emB.png\n*****\n&gt; Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower this week, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed\u2019s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,\u201d Donabedian said. \u201cThese are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it\u2019s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Now watch Congress\n&gt; Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the overall corporate tax rate, it\u2019s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. \u201cThose sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it\u2019s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market\u2019s gains. \u201cOne very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That\u2019s a direct hair cut,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N7rC5Aa.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HWQvdLE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mhxbqUc.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/56EBVaE.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/h3mvijP.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mY4BIi5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6zaLis8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwYa3KS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HdA9rex.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GDh7ITS.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/47iBGVi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/UU3eRed.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sHAUFMJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/lihZlf8.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens\n\n&gt; Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of \"moderate\" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**\n\n&gt; In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige-vs-GDP-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks\n\n&gt; Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The \"reddit army\" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**\n\n&gt; The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**\n\n&gt; To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma &amp; Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**\n\n&gt; Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.\n\n&gt; To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Decile-Analysis-R3000-SIPF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago\n\n&gt; Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&amp;P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**\n\n&gt; Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&amp;J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner &amp; Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&amp;P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**\n\n&gt; The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 310.61%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-top-25-performance-v4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month\n\n&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month\u2019s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0406c0510bf2760aa9f1ca7ca37db204/b461817d00bd35c3-2e/s500x750/6431255e2d043e4c8bfa5bc2ea302c3594098196.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September quarterly option expiration week: S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 18\n\n&gt; September\u2019s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September\u2019s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a78dfb81813e1a58a41595c56f0d123a/159500c1f2844242-29/s640x960/97fa0711c0bca38817bcf2f7ba591836ab31bba1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?\n\n&gt; This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.\n\n&gt; In today\u2019s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.\n\n&gt; The catch (and there\u2019s always a catch) is the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.\n\n&gt; But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. \u201cLooking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSo should we see any seasonal weakness, we\u2019d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.\n\n&gt; From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.\n\n&gt; Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 10th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.12.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.13.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7kWjurx.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Os3qSw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.14.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jjaTGzM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fTsIG8P.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9kTEtg.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.16.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.17.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets. :)",

I\u2019m not sure if this is a strategy that is already out there, but I am looking for a database or a list put out by the CBOE or another exchange that shows this type of information. Does anybody have additional information on this or where I can get a list of companies selling puts on their stock? I know this was something Microsoft did for some time.",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nMy main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.\n\nI am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. \n\nI back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.\n\n[Back Testing Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=22&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=AAPL&amp;allocation1_1=20&amp;symbol2=AMZN&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;symbol3=GOOGL&amp;allocation3_1=20&amp;symbol4=MSFT&amp;allocation4_1=20&amp;symbol5=TSLA&amp;allocation5_1=20)",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone. Happy Saturday and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months\u2026\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs\u2026however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid\u2026.\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be\u2026however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially\u2026.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 8, 2021**\n\n*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight. Stock currently around $856. ASML is probably the most important and influential tech company you\u2019ve never heard of.\n* Chipotle (CMG) with two target raises. Stock c currently around $1905\n   * Cowen from $2080 from $2250 at Overweight\n   * BTIG Research from $1850 to $2150 at Outperform\n* Coupa Software with a host of target raises following earnings.

And its stock is inexpensive. \nBy Eric J. Savitz \n\nThis should be a magical moment for Plantronics, the producer of conference-room products and office headsets, better known as Poly. \n\nWith a gradual return to the office, there is expected to be a surge in \"hybrid meetings\" -- mixing in-person and virtual participants. Poly CEO Dave Shull estimates that there are about 50 million conference rooms globally, and that 10% or less are equipped for videoconferencing. That is a huge potential opportunity for Poly (ticker: POLY) and its competitors. \n\nShares of Poly, meanwhile, have been driven down to bargain-basement levels by the fallout from an ill-fated merger three years ago. At a recent $32, the stock now trades for about 0.7 times anticipated revenue for the March 2023 fiscal year, and just under eight times projected profits for the same period. \n\nIn comparison, Logitech International (LOGI), which has an overlapping set of products, trades for about 3.2 times revenue and 22 times projected profits for the same period. \n\nAt such deeply discounted levels, investors willing to be patient could reap rich rewards as a turnaround gets underway at Poly.",

We're on the growth trajectory that we projected. We have become the world's leading provider of enterprise AI applications.\n\nWe just formed a very, very strategic relationship with Google Cloud where the almost 4,000-strong sales person organization at Google Cloud will be selling all of our applications globally, so that dramatically increases our sales capacity, say, by a couple of orders of magnitude.\n\nAnd I think the company's right on track, and you know, I don't really watch the stock price day to day. That's not my job. I think, as far as I'm concerned, we have $1 billion cash in the bank. We have enough money to do what we need to do. The market can just close for five years, and I think if it opens, then all the shareholders will be happy.\n\n- Some strong words. I was going to ask you about the stock move. I know you don't like to comment on it, but we are seeing it under some pressure today, so I just wonder what you think investors are missing in terms of the growth story that C3 AI is on right now.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, let's think about this. We deliver 40 turnkey enterprise AI applications a day, for banking, for manufacturing, for oil and gas, financial services, telecommunications, and manufacturing. Google Cloud decided they wanted-- these are very, very high value applications, where these companies are realizing billions of dollars a year annual economic benefit from these apps.\n\nNow, the Google Cloud decided that they wanted to change the competitive dynamics of the hyperscaler market, and lead with turnkey enterprise applications rather than CPU seconds and storage as they compete against the other hyperscalers.\n\nIt's a new think about this in terms of, maybe they needed to approach a partner who had a portfolio of applications like that. How many doors are there to knock on in the world? There's virtually only one. We're the only company in this business. We're the only pure play in enterprise application software in the world, in applications, other than, say, toys. Like, toys would be storage, or toys would be virtualization, or toys would be a machine learning library. We don't deliver toys, we deliver applications.\n\nSo we're the only company in this game. This is a-- probably a $300 to $400 billion addressable market, and I think we're going about establishing a market leadership position in that space, and that's the big picture. And I think we have three, four, five, ten years to execute that strategy. If we execute it, this will be one of the great technology companies in the world.\n\n- Yeah, let's use that five year frame here, then. Because you know, I felt like when we were at the IPO stage, right? When was that? A year ago, more than a year ago, right? When we're looking at the growth rate, right? And you came on, and you were kind of honest about, we're not going to run 75% growth all the time. It's going to moderate a little bit, and we've seen that now in terms of, kind of, subscription revenue here up 29%, total revenue up 29% year over year.\n\nI mean, when you look at that five year time frame, and position it where the stock's trading now, I mean, what is it that you would tell investors about where you'll be in five years if all the things pan out? The Google Cloud partnership, and also the government contracts that it sounded like analysts might not have been projecting quite correctly.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, I think, you know, again, whatever the stock did this morning is, you know, it'll do what it does. And the 29% growth rate will put us in the top decile, certainly, of high growth companies in enterprise application software. The analysts' predictions are that our growth rate will accelerate in the coming years.\n\nAnd I think the company is right on track. It's all good. I think we're very pleased. We're pleased with our Microsoft partnership, our Google partnership, our Baker Hughes partnership, FIS partnership. This company is right on track, and I'm quite pleased with the results.\n\n- You've got a pretty broad footprint right now across sectors, whether that's in manufacturing or financials. A long list here in terms of your research on enterprise AI. Where are you seeing the biggest growth right now? What are you most excited about?\n\nTOM SIEBEL: I think in the long run-- so today, we're huge in energy, oil and gas-- excuse me, energy efficiency, telecommunications, manufacturing, aerospace, defense, intelligence. In the long run, I'm personally most excited about precision health. Precision health will be the largest commercial application of AI, where we will be able to do very precise disease prediction, and therefore be able to intervene clinically and avoid the diagnosis.\n\nWe'll have AI-assisted medicine, genome specific medical protocols. I think the economic and social benefits that will accrue from applying AI to precision health are going to be really staggering. This will-- people will live longer, they will be healthier, we will deliver health care at lower cost, and we will do it-- we'll deliver-- using devices like this, we will be delivering health care to a massively large, previously underserved communities.\n\nSQUEEEEZE!

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 13th, 2021.\n\n# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve\u2019s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.\n*****\n&gt; Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed\u2019s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed\u2019s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.\n*****\n&gt; # Hot CPI\n&gt; \u201cIf the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August\u2019s producer price index \u2014 which was released Friday \u2014 showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August\u2019s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cCertainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it\u2019s an issue for the bond market if it\u2019s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,\u201d CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf markets have an inflation mutiny here and there\u2019s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,\u201d Donabedian said of the Fed\u2019s taper announcement. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Stagflation?\n&gt; That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August\u2019s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m more about the \u2018flation\u2019 side of it than the \u2018stag.\u2019 I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,\u201d Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a \u201cshort-term warning.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It\u2019s really settled down now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you\u2019re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you\u2019re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There\u2019s income there for consumers to spend. We\u2019re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn\u2019t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn\u2019t call it stagflation.\u201d\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tjC3emB.png\n*****\n&gt; Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower this week, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed\u2019s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,\u201d Donabedian said. \u201cThese are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it\u2019s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Now watch Congress\n&gt; Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the overall corporate tax rate, it\u2019s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. \u201cThose sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it\u2019s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market\u2019s gains. \u201cOne very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That\u2019s a direct hair cut,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N7rC5Aa.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HWQvdLE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mhxbqUc.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/56EBVaE.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/h3mvijP.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mY4BIi5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6zaLis8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwYa3KS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HdA9rex.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GDh7ITS.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/47iBGVi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/UU3eRed.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sHAUFMJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/lihZlf8.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens\n\n&gt; Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of \"moderate\" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**\n\n&gt; In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige-vs-GDP-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks\n\n&gt; Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The \"reddit army\" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**\n\n&gt; The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**\n\n&gt; To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma &amp; Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**\n\n&gt; Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.\n\n&gt; To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Decile-Analysis-R3000-SIPF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago\n\n&gt; Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&amp;P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**\n\n&gt; Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&amp;J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner &amp; Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&amp;P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**\n\n&gt; The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 310.61%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-top-25-performance-v4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month\n\n&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month\u2019s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0406c0510bf2760aa9f1ca7ca37db204/b461817d00bd35c3-2e/s500x750/6431255e2d043e4c8bfa5bc2ea302c3594098196.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September quarterly option expiration week: S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 18\n\n&gt; September\u2019s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September\u2019s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a78dfb81813e1a58a41595c56f0d123a/159500c1f2844242-29/s640x960/97fa0711c0bca38817bcf2f7ba591836ab31bba1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?\n\n&gt; This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.\n\n&gt; In today\u2019s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.\n\n&gt; The catch (and there\u2019s always a catch) is the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.\n\n&gt; But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. \u201cLooking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSo should we see any seasonal weakness, we\u2019d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.\n\n&gt; From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.\n\n&gt; Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 10th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.12.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.13.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7kWjurx.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Os3qSw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.14.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jjaTGzM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fTsIG8P.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9kTEtg.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.16.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.17.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",

A percentage of these spreads can get assigned, lets assume I take the shares and sell calls on them till they reach my break even. \n\n\\- I have both on MSFT, TSLA, NVDA, FB, COST and PYPL.

        "selftext": "In April 2020, ecommerce spending exploded globally. In 8 short weeks, US ecommerce spending as a % of total retail sales grew from 16% to 27%. $SHOP and $AMZN have seen their TAM grow massively and their valuations have grown to reflect this.\n\nWhat if I told you something very similar is happening right now in enterprise SaaS?\n\nAmazingly, in 2020, cloud/SaaS spending is still only 9.1% of total global IT spend. But this in changing. Spending on  cloud/SaaS is expected to grow by 18.4% in 2021 alone.\n\nMuch in the same way that the pandemic has made ecommerce a core part of any retail company\u2019s strategy, it has made SaaS a core part of every company\u2019s plans.\n\nOn-premise software just doesn\u2019t make sense in a remote-first world.\n\nJust like Amazon and Shopify have benefited from the eccommerce explosion, companies like $WDAY, $CRM, $MSFT and $OKTA will benefit from the SaaS explosion.\n\nRead more here: https://tadhg.substack.com/p/the-saas-market-opportunity-is-way",

They are chinese so hard to trust. Company could be taken private and nobody knows if they will be relisted. So its a very high risk position. \n\nPAYO is a payment system provider like stripe, paypal and many. I think is overlooked as it only ipoed few months ago. Market cap of 2B \n\nZIM here the train is already gone with a 400% YTD performance. However they have a strong balance sheet and based in Israele is a big plus as to shipping containers is a very great location.

However \u203a due to TEAM's steady predictability &amp; rapidly growing revenues \u203a he aggressively solicits a posture of Atlassian long game \u203a as one can make room in a portfolio for tech companies that are the disruptors &amp; carry a moat. \n\nConnected Enterprise\n\nAtlassian \u203a TEAM \u203a produces software that helps teams work together more efficiently &amp; effectively \u203a offering a broad set of \u203a easy to deploy &amp; use tools \u2933 Jira \u203a Confluence \u203a Bitbucket \u203a Trello.\n\n83% of Fortune 500 companies use Atlassian software products \u203a utilized by more than 212K customers at both large &amp; small organizations \u203a for open teamwork models &amp; autonomous project planning &amp; management \u203a that provides an environment for enterprises to experiment &amp; optimize employee experience \u203a for frictionless work environments \u203a business partners \u203a in a connected vendor ecosystem \u203a for easy interaction back &amp; forth &amp; quick response to market signals \u203a &amp; connect with customers \u203a to deepen relationships via those processes.\n\nAs teamwork becomes increasingly digital \u203a investing in a connected enterprise is the clear path forward for 10 million monthly active users who use Atlassian cloud collaboration management tools &amp; help desk solutions \u203a to support a variety of collaboration styles &amp; provide standardization to innovate &amp; cut costs. \n\nAtlassian operates in 4 segments \u2933 1 \u203a subscriptions \u203a term licenses &amp; cloud agreements \u2933 2 \u203a maintenance \u203a annual maintenance contracts that provide support &amp; periodic updates &amp; are generally attached to perpetual license sales \u2933 3 \u203a perpetual license \u203a upfront sale for indefinite usage of the software \u2933 4 \u203a other \u203a training \u203a strategic consulting &amp; revenue from the Atlassian Marketplace app store.\n\nFirst Mover Advantage\n\nWhat sets Atlassian apart is its first mover advantage in its core market. Given the time sensitive nature &amp; delivery windows of most software projects \u203a most of Atlassian's customers simply don\u2019t have the appetite for risking project execution nor the time to adopt a new platform. This has resulted in creating a moat \u203a  as there are indirect costs associated with the learning curve &amp; switching altogether to another platform. \n\nAtlassian delivers the tools &amp; platforms that developers need to build applications \u203a with every company in every sector becoming a software-driven company \u203a there will be almost infinite demand for new applications. As developers raced to build new applications to help their companies cope with the pandemic \u203a they gravitated toward the tools that enabled them to work the fastest &amp; most efficiently. Every company from the smallest mom &amp; pop shop to the largest multinational realized with utmost clarity that they would live or die by software.\n\n\u201cWe are a multi-product company. We differ from many companies that get product/market fit &amp; grow to $500 million in revenue before their second product. We introduced a second product \u203a Confluence \u203a before we reached that scale. We found that customers perceived that software documentation is poor \u2014 we developed a product for document collaboration that\u2019s like a Google Doc on steroids. We have multi-product in our DNA. We now have 14 different products.\u201d \u2933 Cameron Deatsch - Chief Revenue Officer.\n\nAtlassian applies the now-popular agile systems development mindset to all its operations. \n\n\u201cAs far as process \u203a we use an agile approach. This differs \u203a from the traditional waterfall approach \u203a in which system requirements are developed over two years &amp; handed off to the systems development people to build. With agile \u203a we start with customer goals &amp; iteratively build versus the goals. Every two weeks we ship something &amp; learn from it. We can apply this approach to marketing \u203a closing the books \u203a &amp; so on. We have daily stand-ups &amp; two week sprints.\"\n\nCustomer Growth\n\nAtlassian products meet a unique market need for business customers \u203a modernizing collaboration through human-centered technology \u2933 including office productivity tools \u203a video conferencing platforms \u203a file synchronization \u203a sharing solutions \u203a content management apps &amp; more \u2933 empowering companies to design experiences that unlock less fragmented workflows &amp; bring people together in seamless \u203a interconnected &amp; digital experiences.\n\nThey are able to land customers at a low cost with little human intervention. In the latest quarter \u203a Atlassian brought in 17k new customers who never talked to people at Atlassian or its partners \u203a equating to a robust 9.5% sequential QoQ growth \u203a driven by 5.7k  Trello accounts \u203a as a result of new product features &amp; TEAM\u2019s recent sales funnel optimization initiatives.\n\nThe addressable market size in total is an estimated $125 billion \u203a in terms of potential users \u203a including 800 million knowledge workers at the highest level \u203a drilling down to 100 million technical team members &amp; 23 million software developers. Atlassian noted\u00a0during the recent industry conference \u203a the company continues to out its online ecosystem \u203a with a marketplace for over 4k apps that utilize its product technology \u2933 recently launched Forge \u203a which provides runtime for these apps.\n\nAtlassian invents new products through processes propelled by its employees. \u203a it builds on its strengths \u2933 a focus on teams\u203a of which there are many different kinds in different industries \u203a come up with new products by looking at customer use cases &amp; trends outside the norm. Service management is the fastest growing product.\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nAtlassian continues its strong track record of growth \u203a Q3\u201921 revenue growing 38% YoY \u203a driven by subscription revenue growth of 43% YoY. Subscription now comprises 62% of TEAM\u2019s total revenue &amp; its recurring nature helps to smooth out the revenue stream \u203a resulting in higher predictability.\n\nAtlassian has grown impressively over the past few years because it adopts a low-cost web-based marketing &amp; lean transactional operating model \u203a going without a traditional enterprise salesforce &amp; marketing team. Atlassian has a large opportunity ahead \u203a demonstrating strong profitability relative to peers \u203a with a gross profit margin of 84% \u203a far higher than the 49% sector average \u203a a strong balance sheet &amp; plenty of cash to fund future growth initiatives \u203a its FCF margin is 43% \u203a comparing favorably to 12.6% sector median. \n\nGiven the subscription-heavy nature of the business \u203a Atlassian's revenue stream has resulted in sequential quarterly revenue growth over at least the past 3 years &amp; this includes pandemic quarters. Atlassian stopped new sales of server license \u203a increased pricing &amp; created pull-forward effects that incentivize users to renew early \u203a leading to strong revenue &amp; billings growth. Atlassian has demonstrated impressive revenue growth since its IPO in 2015 \u203a growing by 513% over this timeframe to $1.96 billion for the trailing 12 months. Atlassian maintains a fortress balance sheet to fund growth initiatives, with $1.56 billion in cash &amp; short-term investments \u203a no long-term debt, and just $206M in capital leases.\n\nTEAM has outperformed the market in the last year with a price return of \u2191 91.4% while the SPY ETF gained \u2191 30.1%. TEAM has also outperformed the stock market ETF in the last 3 month &amp; 2 week periods returning \u2191 62.1% &amp; \u2191 11.3% \u203a respectively \u203a SPY returned \u2191 8.3% &amp; \u2191 3.2%. Last quarter \u203a Atlassian reported $560 million in Revenue &amp; $.24 earnings per share \u203a this beat revenue expectation by $35 million &amp; exceeded earnings estimates by $.06.\n\nValuation\n\nPotential for competition from legacy software provider Microsoft \u203a MSFT \u203a in the space in which TEAM operates. Atlassian will directly compete against ServiceNow \u203a NOW \u203a as it encroaches on the service desk space. Atlassian\u2019s formal planning processes are adjusted so it can adapt to new threats or opportunities. That\u2019s what happened last year when a competitor\u2019s IPO gave it extra capital to spend on marketing to Atlassian\u2019s customers. Atlassian reprioritized go-to-market resources to keep customer acquisition up in light of that competitor\u2019s spending. One product leader got less. They have OKRs &amp; they adjust.\n\nDisclosure\n\nWithout data \u203a you're just another \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f with an opinion \u2933 Dogeboy\u2019s 17 Sep 21 calls are \u2191 770%",

        "selftext": "If you\u2019ve been following Reddit and Twitter from last week, CCJ has been one of the most talked about tickers, and rightfully so as the stock is up 60% in one month and 15% just last week. Interestingly enough, on Friday the stock price closed at the area with the most Gamma Exposure (GEX) at $25 per share.\n\nPersonally, I like Uranium as a long-term hold, but this price action deserves some paying attention to and potentially taking some profits off the table.\n\nFor those of you that don\u2019t remember or haven\u2019t read some of my other posts. Here\u2019s a description of the boxes/zones I\u2019ve overlaid on the chart.\n\n* Red Zone = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play.\n* Orange Zone = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone.\n* Green Zone = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwz91k3tj5n71.png?width=2402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46d2784339171190537fc231271da66977f58f31\n\nOf course, these zones are very easy to notice after-the-fact. Going into June CCJ would have looked to have been on a steady up-trend and buying any dips earlier this year along the way would have netted some nice returns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll be keeping an eye on CCJ next week to see what happens with this squeeze or if it reverts back to the mean. Entering a new position here and chasing FOMO is extremely risky. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on this if it goes back into the low $20\u2019s to enter another position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s look at my short-list of \u201cbuy the dip\u201d stocks this week.\n\n# The BTFD (Buy The F\u2019n Dip) List\n\n**Ametek (AME)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxu2m9vtj5n71.png?width=2404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b6eedffa4f173e1d7823cf47d626d7372fa41b\n\nIf you don\u2019t know about Ametek then all you need to know is that it is a beast of a company. Strong fundamentals, strong business model, and is nicknamed the \u201cniche acquirer\u201d from their strategic list of acquisitions. AME is typically a very slow moving stock, similar to Microsoft, but if you zoom the chart out over a couple years you\u2019ll see this thing only goes up. The very small dip recently might prove to be a good entry point if you\u2019ve been waiting to get in for some time. Ex-dividend date is also tomorrow. So I would expect this to be slightly green, if the market permits, to make up for the div.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Salesforce (CRM)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gbqynguj5n71.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff07c616c63147ba228d85cb40554afc87a63f6b\n\nAnother long-term stock for my portfolio. CRM saw some tailwinds early on during Covid, but over the last 12 months the stock price has stalled. In my opinion last week\u2019s dip could be a good entry. The $250 level, which was previously resistance, might also be a good support zone to enter. Keep an eye on the 50 EMA which it was been bouncing off during this recent uptrend since May.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The MEME List\n\nThe \u201cmeme\u201d list isn\u2019t necessarily meme stocks, but it\u2019s what I refer to when I\u2019m talking about stocks that have potential to trend on social media, or they are generally higher-risk growth-stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac8k3eivj5n71.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4acc054e09790d4fe23db1354c236820e9f75658\n\nSquare, which saw insane growth through Covid, has somewhat lost it\u2019s momentum. This 10% dip over the last several weeks gives it a better entry than at $275 when it was a slightly over-extended. RSI hitting over-sold and volume profile sitting right at the shelf where trading volume thins out. IMO this is a quality name to own for the long-term and although the stock is up a lot in the last 6 months, today offers a better entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**D-Local (DLO)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iyi3bw6vj5n71.png?width=2398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc147db4aed6820b9733439128a7beaf69f62766\n\nYou don\u2019t see this name around Reddit too much, but I think it deserves to get on most people\u2019s radar. DLO is a payment processor for Latin America, and 3rd world/emerging markets. The growth they are experiencing is over 100% YoY, which drove the stock price +30% on earnings in August. Since then it\u2019s had about a month\u2019s worth of consolidation at the $65 level. I think here at $62 provides an \u201corange box\u201d entry which I am willing to take a risk at. Ideally I would have liked to enter in the $50\u2019s, but that\u2019s what investing is all about, finding ideal risk-to-reward opportunities.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 13th, 2021.\n\n# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve\u2019s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.\n*****\n&gt; Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed\u2019s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed\u2019s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.\n*****\n&gt; # Hot CPI\n&gt; \u201cIf the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August\u2019s producer price index \u2014 which was released Friday \u2014 showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August\u2019s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cCertainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it\u2019s an issue for the bond market if it\u2019s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,\u201d CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf markets have an inflation mutiny here and there\u2019s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,\u201d Donabedian said of the Fed\u2019s taper announcement. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Stagflation?\n&gt; That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August\u2019s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m more about the \u2018flation\u2019 side of it than the \u2018stag.\u2019 I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,\u201d Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a \u201cshort-term warning.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It\u2019s really settled down now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you\u2019re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you\u2019re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There\u2019s income there for consumers to spend. We\u2019re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn\u2019t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn\u2019t call it stagflation.\u201d\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tjC3emB.png\n*****\n&gt; Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower this week, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed\u2019s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.\n*****\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,\u201d Donabedian said. \u201cThese are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it\u2019s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Now watch Congress\n&gt; Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the overall corporate tax rate, it\u2019s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate.

For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of \"moderate\" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**\n\n&gt; In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige-vs-GDP-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks\n\n&gt; Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The \"reddit army\" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**\n\n&gt; The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**\n\n&gt; To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma &amp; Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**\n\n&gt; Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.\n\n&gt; To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Decile-Analysis-R3000-SIPF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago\n\n&gt; Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&amp;P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**\n\n&gt; Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&amp;J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner &amp; Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&amp;P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**\n\n&gt; The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 310.61%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-top-25-performance-v4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month\n\n&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month\u2019s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0406c0510bf2760aa9f1ca7ca37db204/b461817d00bd35c3-2e/s500x750/6431255e2d043e4c8bfa5bc2ea302c3594098196.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September quarterly option expiration week: S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 18\n\n&gt; September\u2019s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September\u2019s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a78dfb81813e1a58a41595c56f0d123a/159500c1f2844242-29/s640x960/97fa0711c0bca38817bcf2f7ba591836ab31bba1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?\n\n&gt; This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.\n\n&gt; In today\u2019s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.\n\n&gt; The catch (and there\u2019s always a catch) is the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.\n\n&gt; But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. \u201cLooking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSo should we see any seasonal weakness, we\u2019d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.\n\n&gt; From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.\n\n&gt; Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 10th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhzjLed1sjg))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.12.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.13.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7kWjurx.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Os3qSw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.14.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jjaTGzM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fTsIG8P.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9kTEtg.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.16.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.17.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

It is known as \u201cCELLAR BOXING\u201d and it has to do with the fact that the NASD and the SEC had to arbitrarily set a minimum level at which a stock can trade. This level was set at $.0001 or one-one hundredth of a penny. This level is appropriately referred to as \u201cthe CELLAR\u201d. This $.0001 level can be used as a \"backstop\" for all kinds of market maker and naked short selling manipulations.  \n\n\n\u201cCELLAR BOXING\u201d has been one of the security frauds du jour since 1999 when the market went to a \u201cdecimalization\u201d basis. In the pre-decimalization days the minimum market spread for most stocks was set at 1/8th of a dollar and the market makers were guaranteed a healthy \u201cspread\u201d. Since decimalization came into effect, those one-eighth of a dollar spreads now are often only a penny as you can see in Microsoft\u2019s quote throughout the day. Where did the unscrupulous MMs go to make up for all of this lost income? They headed \"south\" to the OTCBB and Pink Sheets where the protective effects from naked short selling like Rule 10-a, and NASD Rules 3350, 3360, and 3370 are nonexistent.  \n\n\nThe unique aspect of needing an arbitrary \u201cCELLAR\u201d level is that the lowest possible incremental gain above this CELLAR level represents a 100% spread available to MMs making a market in these securities. When compared to the typical spread in Microsoft of perhaps four-tenths of 1%, this is pretty tempting territory. In fact, when the market is no bid to $.0001 offer there is theoretically an infinite spread.  \n\n\nIn order to participate in \u201cCELLAR BOXING\u201d, the MMs first need to pummel the **price** per share down to these levels. The lower they can force the share price, the larger are the percentage spreads to feed off of. This is easily done via garden variety naked short selling. In fact if the MM is large enough and has enough visibility of buy and sell orders as well as order flow, he can simultaneously be acting as the conduit for the sale of nonexistent shares through Canadian co-conspiring broker/dealers and their associates with his right hand at the same time that his left hand is naked short selling into every buy order that appears through its own proprietary accounts. The key here is to be a dominant enough of a MM to have visibility of these buy orders. This is referred to as \"broker/dealer internalization\" or naked short selling via \"desking\" which refers to the market makers trading desk. While the right hand is busy flooding the victim company's market with \"counterfeit\" shares that can be sold at any instant in time the left hand is nullifying any upward pressure in share price by neutralizing the demand for the securities. The net effect becomes no demonstrable demand for shares and a huge oversupply of shares which induces a downward spiral in share price.  \n\n\nIn fact, until the \"beefed up\" version of Rule 3370 (Affirmative determination in writing of \"borrowability\" by settlement date) becomes effective, U.S. MMs have been \"legally\" processing naked short sale orders out of Canada and other offshore locations even though they and the clearing firms involved knew by history that these shares were in no way going to be delivered. The question that then begs to be asked is how \"the system\" can allow these obviously bogus sell orders to clear and settle. To find the answer to this one need look no further than to Addendum \"C\" to the Rules and Regulations of the NSCC subdivision of the DTCC. This gaping loophole allows the DTCC, which is basically the 11,000 b/ds and banks that we refer to as \"Wall Street\u201d, to borrow shares from those investors naive enough to hold these shares in \"street name\" at their brokerage firm. This amounts to about 95% of us. Theoretically, this \u201cborrow\u201d was designed to allow trades to clear and settle that involved LEGITIMATE 1 OR 2 DAY delays in delivery. This \"borrow\" is done unbeknownst to the investor that purchased the shares in question and amounts to probably the largest \"conflict of interest\" known to mankind. The question becomes would these investors knowingly loan, without compensation, their shares to those whose intent is to bankrupt their investment if they knew that the loan process was the key mechanism needed for the naked short sellers to effect their goal? Another question that arises is should the investor's b/d who just earned a commission and therefore owes its client a fiduciary duty of care, be acting as the intermediary in this loan process keeping in mind that this b/d is being paid the cash value of the shares being loaned as a means of collateralizing the loan, all unbeknownst to his client the purchaser.  \n\n\nAn interesting phenomenon occurs at these \"CELLAR\" levels. Since NASD Rule 3370 allows MMs to legally naked short sell into markets characterized by a plethora of buy orders at a time when few sell orders are in existence, a MM can theoretically \"legally\" sit at the $.0001 level and sell nonexistent shares all day long because at no bid and $.0001 ask there is obviously a huge disparity between buy orders and sell orders. What tends to happen is that every time the share price tries to get off of the CELLAR floor and onto the first step of the stairway at $.0001 there is somebody there to step on the hands of the victim corporation's market.  \n\n\nOnce a given micro cap corporation is \u201cboxed in the CELLAR\u201d it doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of options to climb its way out of the CELLAR. One obvious option would be for it to reverse split its way out of the CELLAR but history has shown that these are counter-productive as the market capitalization typically gets hammered and the post split share price level starts heading back to its original pre-split level.  \n\n\nAnother option would be to organize a sustained buying effort and muscle your way out of the CELLAR but typically there will, as if by magic, be a naked short sell order there to meet each and every buy order. Sometimes the shareholder base can muster up enough buying pressure to put the market at $.0001 bid and $.0002 offer for a limited amount of time. Later the market makers will typically pound the $.0001 bids with a blitzkrieg of selling to wipe out all of the bids and the market goes back to no bid and $.0001 offer. When the weak-kneed shareholders see this a few times they usually make up their mind to sell their shares the next time that a $.0001 bid appears and to get the heck out of Dodge. This phenomenon is referred to as \u201cshaking the tree\u201d for weak-kneed investors and it is very effective.  \n\n\nAt times the market will go to $.0001 bid and $.0003 offer. This sets up a juicy 200% spread for the MMs and tends to dissuade any buyers from reaching up to the \"lofty\" level of $.0003. If a $.0002 bid should appear from a MM not \"playing ball\" with the unscrupulous MMs, it will be hit so quickly that Level 2 will never reveal the existence of the bid. The $.0001 bid at $.0003 offer market sets up a \"stalemate\" wherein market makers can leisurely enjoy the huge spreads while the victim company slowly dilutes itself to death by paying the monthly bills with \"real\" shares sold at incredibly low levels. Since all of these development-stage corporations have to pay their monthly bills, time becomes on the side of the naked short sellers.  \n\n\nAt times it almost seems that the unscrupulous market makers are not actively trying to kill the victim corporation but instead want to milk the situation for as long of a period of time as possible and let the corporation die a slow death by dilution. The reality is that it is extremely easy to strip away 99% of a victim company\u2019s share price or market cap and to keep the victim corporation \u201cboxed\u201c in the CELLAR, but it really is difficult to kill a corporation especially after management and the shareholder base have figured out the game that is being played at their expense.  \n\n\nAs the weeks and months go by the market makers make a fortune with these huge percentage spreads but the net aggregate naked short positions become astronomical from all of this activity. This leads to some apprehension amongst the co-conspiring MMs. The predicament they find themselves in is that they can\u2019t even stop naked short selling into every buy order that appears because if they do the share price will gap and this will put tremendous pressures on net capital reserves for the MMs and margin maintenance requirements for the co-conspiring hedge funds and others operating out of the more than 13,000 naked short selling margin accounts set up in Canada. And of course covering the naked short position is out of the question since they can\u2019t even stop the day-to-day naked short selling in the first place and you can't be covering at the same time you continue to naked short sell.  \n\n\nWhat typically happens in these situations is that the victim company has to massively dilute its share structure from the constant paying of the monthly burn rate with money received from the selling of \u201creal\u201d shares at artificially low levels. Then the goal of the naked short sellers is to point out to the investors, usually via paid \u201cInternet bashers\u201d, that with the, let\u2019s say, 50 billion shares currently issued and outstanding, that this lousy company is not worth the $5 million market cap it is trading at, especially if it is just a shell company whose primary business plan was wiped out by the naked short sellers\u2019 tortuous interference earlier on.  \n\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the single biggest asset of these victim companies often becomes the astronomically large aggregate naked short position that has accumulated throughout the initial \u201cbear raid\u201d and also during the \u201cCELLAR BOXING\u201d phase. The goal of the victim company now becomes to avoid the 3 main goals of the naked short sellers, namely: bankruptcy, a reverse split, or the forced signing of a death spiral convertible debenture out of desperation. As long as the victim company can continue to pay the monthly burn rate, then the game plan becomes to make some of the strategic moves that hundreds of victim companies have been forced into doing which includes name changes, CUSIP # changes, cancel/reissue procedures, dividend distributions, amending of by-laws and Articles of Corporation, etc. Nevada domiciled companies usually cancel all of their shares in the system, both real and fake, and force shareholders and their b/ds to PROVE the ownership of the old \u201creal\u201d shares before they get a new \u201creal\u201d share. Many also file their civil suits at this time also. This indirect forcing of hundreds of U.S. micro cap corporations to go through all of these extraneous hoops and hurdles as a means to survive, whether it be due to regulatory apathy or lack of resources, is probably one of the biggest black eyes the U.S. financial systems have ever sustained. In a perfect world it would be the regulators that periodically audit the \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d sub-accounts at the DTCC, the proprietary accounts of the MMs, clearing firms, and Canadian b/ds, and force the buy-in of counterfeit shares, many of which are hiding behind altered CUSIP #s, that are detected above the Rule 11830 guidelines for allowable \u201cfailed deliveries\u201d of one half of 1% of the shares issued. U.S. micro cap corporations should not have to periodically \u201cpurge\u201d their share structure of counterfeit electronic book entries but if the regulators will not do it then management has a fiduciary duty to do it.  \n\n\nA lot of management teams become overwhelmed with grief and guilt in regards to the huge increase in the number of shares issued and outstanding that have accumulated during their \u201cwatch\u201d. The truth however is that as long as management made the proper corporate governance moves throughout this ordeal then a huge number of resultant shares issued and outstanding is unavoidable and often indicative of an astronomically high naked short position and is nothing to be ashamed of. These massive naked short positions need to be looked upon as huge assets that need to be developed. Hopefully the regulators will come to grips with the reality of naked short selling and tactics like \"CELLAR BOXING\" and quickly address this fraud that has decimated thousands of U.S. micro cap corporations and the tens of millions of U.S. investors therein.",

        "selftext": " ( NOTE : this stock was originally brought to my attention by RamenNoodles1776, although im adding various things on to it, the backbone of the argument is by the noodle man )\n\n**introduction**\n\nAlright you pieces of shit, it's time for post #2, and this time it's a less substantiated boy: Cyxtera ( CYXT ). They're a global leader in data center colocation and interconnection services. Now if you're brain dead like I am, I'll tell you what that means : in essence their business is based in a variety of data analyzing, managing, and protection services ( cyber shit ). Now normally this wouldn\u2019t mean much, BUT due to Biden\u2019s push for cybersecurity as of late, as well as several other factors, it's actually incredibly well poised to explode and reach andromeda.\n\n**Bullet time**\n\nNow i could post all about their earnings, volume movement, target estimation, outlook, but you\u2019re lazy ass doesn't want to look at that so I'll just be loud, quick and decisive with some handy dandy bullet points :\n\n* In the last week or so their stocks has increased 10%\n* Still merely under 10$ in price per share, their so low right now that an increase in their price would magnify gains greater than any blue-chip could reach\n* Regardless of the actual performance of the company their placement as a market leader gives them an intrinsic advantage in data service opportunities provided by the government ( oooooo big boy words )\n* Considering major companies like google, Microsoft and amazon all have extremely large portions of themselves dedicated to data, it is not unwise to assume \n\n**The Real shit**\n\n\\****Alright time for some fuckin graphs.***\n\nThis first graph provides information regarding the speculated data services over the next 6 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwlp3sozc7l71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9efc951faee4b1adab0d77263cd28468fcf14181\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5op8tozc7l71.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4c17582bc4ff91cb4afd762eda89278631e67b0\n\nNow, if you have eyes, one can see that this is clearly an exponential trend which would of course coincide with a positive change in CYXT\u2019s stock price as well. Now you may ask yourself \u201c well why hasn't it gone up yet then ya fuckin doofus\u201d. Well ya piece of shit, I'll tell you : amazon and other companies like it have been mostly monopolizing data services and Cyxtera hasn\u2019t been in a position to fight back. HOWEVER, Biden has made a strong push towards antitrust scrutiny of amazon and other such companies. Thus allowing for it to get a foothold that will allow it to hulk jump into space. \n\nAs was said before, its a major data management company but it\u2019s been faced with a variety of compounding factors that's been holding it down, with the biggest being : IT'S PRETTY NEW.\n\nIt's not just coming out dicks swinging right outta the gate it has to first develop a reputation and develop itself before people start putting money into it, and the time for that is very close at hand.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nBuy it or don\u2019t buy it, no matter what your choice is, feel free to...\n\n# Suck my meat on soft\n\nSummary : ( courtesy of RamenNoodles1776 )\n\nCyxtera finally hit 1.5 billion market cap, this new spac venture is well positioned to take advantage of Biden's push for cyber security. They are the third largest data colocation center in the world and went public with the svac spac purchase in august, which is now CYXT. They essentially have a secure path to hold all of business data acting as a giant server that has locations all over the world.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n*Noodle man Disclaimer, I do have a small amount of call options out through November on CYXT (after their quarterly report) and am in no way a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "In April 2020, ecommerce spending exploded globally. In 8 short weeks, US ecommerce spending as a % of total retail sales grew from 16% to 27%. $SHOP and $AMZN have seen their TAM grow massively and their valuations have grown to reflect this.\n\nWhat if I told you something very similar is happening right now in enterprise SaaS?\n\nAmazingly, in 2020, cloud/SaaS spending is still only 9.1% of total global IT spend. But this in changing. Spending on  cloud/SaaS is expected to grow by 18.4% in 2021 alone.\n\nMuch in the same way that the pandemic has made ecommerce a core part of any retail company\u2019s strategy, it has made SaaS a core part of every company\u2019s plans.\n\nOn-premise software just doesn\u2019t make sense in a remote-first world.\n\nJust like Amazon and Shopify have benefited from the eccommerce explosion, companies like $WDAY, $CRM, $MSFT and $OKTA will benefit from the SaaS explosion.\n\nRead more here: https://tadhg.substack.com/p/the-saas-market-opportunity-is-way",

        "selftext": "What\u2019s up my stoner friends. I re-rolled all the highlights from last week to this Monday on the stock market.  \n\nNon-farm data came out last Friday. It brought some concerns to the market, but I\u2019m gonna stick to my plan and keep buying more promising stocks. \n\n# Highlights:\n\n# 1. Non farm data2. Reddit IPO  3. Windows11 launches on 10/5\n\n\\-\n\n# Non farm payrolls out \n\nThe rising of Delta cases caused a dramatic drop - the monthly employment numbers went WAY lower than expected: 23.5k VS 72.5K, the unemployment rate also dropped to 5.2% compared to July.  \n\nMany experts consider this a signal of postponing \u201c the taper,\u201d which is a clear sign of slower growth along with uncertainty in the market. However, as wages and unemployment rate shows, it\u2019s not as bad as it looks. \n\nIn this case, I remain bullish in the short run. \n\n\\-\n\n# Reddit IPO = WSB IPO? \n\nThe birthplace of our beloved MEME stock, Reddit, is seeking to hire advisers for their IPO next year to GIT MORE $$$$. Targeting a 15$ billion valuation when listed on the stock market. I\u2019m expecting mayhem on meme stocks a week before Reddit\u2019s IPO.  We\u2019ll sit and wait before the show begins.  \n\n\\-\n\n# Windows 11 is one month away\n\nThe long awaited new windows OS will be released on October 5th as MSFT recently announced. It will be a free upgrade for you as long as you have a legit windows 10 in your devices. \n\nThat being said, as usual, the upgrade will roll out in phases - current windows 10 users will likely be offered an upgrade weeks after new products. Analysts estimate it will contribute 19% of MSFT\u2019s profit for 2021.  \n\nI personally am a big fan of MSFT in terms of their business model and outlook. New OS seems pretty decent and clean. So I will be adding more MSFT into my long term portfolio. Again. \ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you feel the same way about Windows11, also checkout my take on MSFT here:   \n\n\nAlthough it won\u2019t be as nice and peaceful as last week, I\u2019m still expecting slightly bullish on the market this week ahead overall.  Uncertainty isn\u2019t a bearish sign in this case as nothing fundamentally impacts the market in the short run.   \n\n\nThanks for your time, good luck and stay high.",

        "selftext": "Netflix, even though it didnt break 600 yesterday, its certainly still bullish and especially after being in a channel for the last 7 months, i think its due for a break out relatively soon. Also with the miss in jobs and more stimulus entering the market as well as the tapering not starting until November (probably) Id say this next week is a break out week . Now i could be completely wrong and netflix could again go back down to low 500s but idk TA showed a strong support at 580s. \n\nI dont have any positions in it yet but plan on opening a call.\n\nModerna , on the weekly chart it shows that the stock has been respecting the lower 300s support and just now is breaking out of that 3ish week long channel , we will see what happens next week but over all im bullish on it after that break out, i have a few calls for next week and hoping they print.\n\nMsft, I  love this stock, one thing about it is that after it breaks out it consolidates for a bit before breaking out again. Its been coslidating around 300s for a while now so im expecting a break out soon. Plan on opening a position in it after seeing next weeks price action.\n\nFacebook \\^ same applies as msft.\n\nGoogle is a monster expecting it to probably each 3k this week if im being honest, usually after a pull google hits new highs and it did have a pull back this friday so yeah.\n\nOther than that i really have nothing else to say except whats yalls views on these stocks? Also what do yall use for TA? I tend to use 5,20,50,200 emas , vwap and the regular trend lines on the daily and weelky chart how about yall?",

        "selftext": "This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\n**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put\u2026**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a \u201cBlack swan event\u201dby purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars\u2026Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I\u2019m saying that maybe it\u2019s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don\u2019t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m\u2026 another bearish catalyst for the market\u2026 I literally could go on and on guys\u2026. It\u2019s pretty obvious at this point\u2026we\u2019ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December. \n\nEdit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit\u2026",

        "selftext": "\nThis journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.\n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high. I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices. Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\nThis was yesterday, Friday, September 3. \n\n$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\nAm I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!! \n\nFor fucks sake people, THIS IS HUGE!! This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to read\u2026 I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. I\u2019m actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally read\u2026I wish I was joking. Whatever\u2026weird. \n\nGross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026\n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\nSo investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nThe lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\nThey reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July.

I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you. \n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\nLet me be clear\u2026I personally don\u2019t believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I don\u2019t want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do I\u2019ll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. \n\nSince the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios.

It is an actual product that they are track testing and showing off at the IAA Mobility Conference in Germany. Look at the live demo they have up vs. our competitors: \n\n* Luminars Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/c8v23x](https://streamable.com/c8v23x)\n* Continental Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/gyee85](https://streamable.com/gyee85)\n* Velodyne Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/lhtsw2](https://streamable.com/lhtsw2)\n* Microvision Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/paywxe](https://streamable.com/paywxe)\n\nAs you can see by the point cloud and refresh rate MVIS sure looks best in class. MVIS is currently on the path of scaling for production and looking for partners.\n\nMarket Size - The global lidar market size is projected to reach **$6.77 Billion by 2026** and virtually every car company is investing/looking to utilize Lidar in the future for assisted and automated driving. It could be in every new vehicle. Luminar (LAZR) the inferior product as you can easily see by the videos above IPO'd last year with a market cap of $8.1 Billion.\n\n**AR/VR** \\- Microvision produces the MEMS Laser Beam Scanning display engine found in the Microsoft Hololens 2. It was confirmed through a tear down before and just officially via MVIS's last ASM. Also, since Microsoft produces the IVAS (rugged Hololens 2 for military use) it is highly speculated that MVIS is the engine inside that also.  \n\nMarket Size - According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), \u201cGlobal AR and VR Market information By Technology, By Component, By Device Type and Vertical - Forecast till 2027\u201d the market to reach **USD 766 billion by 2025.** Also, Microsoft just won an army contract this year **worth up to $21.9 Billion.** \n\nGoogle the Hololens 2 or IVAS units to see all the cool futuristic shit they can do. I'm not gonna spoon feed you everything.\n\n**Stock Info**\n\nCurrent Market Cap = $2.24 Billion\n\n52 Week High = $28\n\n52 Week Low = $1.38\n\nEstimated Short Interest = 29.75m or 18.29% of FF\n\n Q2 2021 shares held by institutions: **42,174,027 (25.7%)** \n\n**Summary**\n\nSince Sumit Sharma took over as CEO he continues to deliver on his promise to increase shareholder value. The company is open for a buyout, strategic alternative, or going it alone with it's amazing technology. Whatever will be the best route to **INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE**. At it's current share price we are way **UNDERVALUED.** There is more DD out there on the technologies, different verticals, and how we are at an inflection point for these things to pop.

        "selftext": "So, Alibaba is of course the most discussed stock in the last month on this sub, I think. So I decided to discuss Tencent, instead.\n\nI think Tencent is simply incredible. Let's see why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WeChat** \n\nThey own WeChat/Weixin (Weixin is for mainland China, WeChat for everywhere else. I will call it WeChat). WeChat is.. WeChat. Mohnish pabrai calls it \"a bazooka Tencent can fire at will\". It has 1.25 billion users. What can you do on WeChat? Everything. Text, pay for stuff, play games, shop online, anything. Imagine if the following app existed:\n\n* Need something on Amazon? No problem, you can do it directly from WeChat through its mini-app.\n* Need to pay something in a shop? Use TenPay.\n* Need a ride on Uber? Use WeChat mini-app.\n* Need to order food on DoorDash? WeChat.\n\nReplace Amazon with JD, Uber with Didi, DoorDash with Meituan, and you have WeChat. \n\nWeChat is a bazooka beause, if Tencent decides to partner with someone and allows them to integrate in their ecosystem, that business will explode. It happened with Pinduoduo, which mainly works on WeChat: it grew 100% last year.\n\nSince it runs the platform, Tencent gets a commission. Also, it stores all the data that goes through these apps. In 2020, revenue from WeChat was 16.7 billion dollars, out of 74.6 billion in total. WeChat has 3.2 million mini programs on its platform, which transacted 1.6 trillion RMB (247 billion $) in 2020. To get how much this thing is growing, in 2017 it was 210 billion RMB (32b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's empire**\n\nTencent has an impressive number of businesses: they have a subscription revenue which is 62% that of Netflix; a media ads business (bigger than the Nyt), games, cloud, mobile payment services. Their business is so wide it is hard to navigate. Some examples:\n\n1. **Gaming**: Tencent has around 50% of market share in China in the mobile gaming industry. In 2020 they made 29.3 billions from games. In 2021 it is probably going to be lower. Online gaming industry in 2020 was 58b, it is expected to grow to 86b in 2027. Mobile gaming is projected to be 70% of the online gaming market in China by then.\n2. **TenPay**: There are two ways to pay for stuff in China: TenPay and AliPay. While in the West switched from cash to cards, and are still in transition, China has skipped a step and went directly to mobile payments. In 2018 already, a walloping 83% of all payments in China were made through mobile. Now it is around 90%. Cards are useless, in China: they account for less than 5% of payments. In the Western world, Google pay and Apple Pay are only now eroding the empire of Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. China, on the other hand, was to Tencent and Alibaba like a smooth field: they just took over. Apple pay now has around 500 million users world-wide. Tencent has 900 millions. From the last financial report, Tencent shows that revenue of the financial technology and corporate services business increased by 40% year-on-year to RMB 41.9 billion (6. billions). China's mobile payment market is projected to reach 88.4 Billion usd by the year 2027, trailing a CAGR of 47.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's fantastic portfolio**:\n\nBefore you do a cf analysis of Tencent, you need to know that Tencent has a portfolio that is currently valued around 250 billions usd at present. It is like a financial version of Cthulhu, with tentacles everywhere. It is quite hard to navigate/find information about it. They say they are currently invested in over 700 companies, of which only 103 are publicly traded. This guy has put up a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owpL6WmMK30X19Kw3BziAw39rGJbsfIMOOexdtvAkxU/edit) for you that tracks the most notable public ones.\n\nSome notable busineness Tencent owns (percentages might not be accurate):\n\na) Gaming:\n\n* 100% Riot Games (League of Legends)\n* 40% Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* 81.4% Supercell (Clash of Clans)\n* 10% BlueHole (PUBG)\n* 80% Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile)\n* 5% Activision Blizzard.\n* 20% Kingsoft (gaming competitor in China &amp; cloud business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Finance:\n\n* 30% Webank (biggest online bank in China)\n* 2%? Khatabook (digital payments in India)\n* 25% Gojek (same in Indonesia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Social:\n\n* 50.1% Huya (twitch-like)\n* 38% Douyu (twitch-like)\n* 12% Snapchat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) Music:\n\n* 58% Tencent music\n* 6.8% Spotify\n* 10% Universal music group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) E-commerce:\n\n* 25% Sea ltd (which also makes games, does mobile payments etc)\n* 18% JD\n* 17% Pinduodo\n* 7% Vipshop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf) Other\n\n* 20% Meituan (Doordash of China)\n* 15% Nio (ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Valuation**\n\nHow do you value Tencent? Currently, Tencent has a market cap of 619.72b, with a P/E of 24 and P/fcf (trailing 12 months) of 22 (Do not forget the investment portfolio, as well). fcf grew 29.4% a year in the last 10 years. Tencent has Microsoft-style profit margins of 35%. Revenue is growing at more than 30% a year, which is insane for a company this size. With its impressive portfolio, Tencent is poised to have a leading role in a country that is growing it GDP at 7%, that soon will catch up with the US, and where around 500 million people are projected to reach middle class in the next 10 years, something which will benefit tech companies the most. Of course, the risks are China regulations, in particular its anti-monopoly campaign; China in general: VIE structure, accounting standards etc. Here is an earnings based model, but take it with a grain of salt. \n\nDiscount rate: 14%. Based on eps without nri. 20 years.\n\n* Best scenario (20%): year 1-10: 25% growth, y 10-20: 10%. Value: 112.13\n* Normal scenario (60%): y1-10: 18%; y10-20: 10%. Value: 70.38\n* Worst scenario (20%): y1-10: 15%. y10-20: 8%. Value: 55.27\n* Fair value: 75.7\n* current price: 64.56. Undervalued by 17.25 % for a 14% return.  \n\n\nOf course it's all about assumptions. If you raise margin of safety, cut down growth estimates etc, you will get a very different number. I think I used a fairly conservative growth estimate, though. I personally think the upside for Tencent is insane., even though it is a behemoth already. It is one of my strongest buys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might consider doing a separate post about the risks of investing in Tencent: China regulations etc. For now.. thanks for reading!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider](https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) &amp; [gurufocus.com/](https://gurufocus.com/)\n\n[https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/](https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/)\n\n[https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/](https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/)\n\n[https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf](https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf)\n\n[https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html](https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html)\n\n[https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020](https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020)",

        "selftext": "A recurring theme over the past year has been one \u2018expert\u2019 after another bashing index funds calling them a massive bubble that is waiting to pop. \u00a0 \n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/z8f8yutkpvl71.gif)\n\n&gt;Could Index Funds Be \u2018Worse Than Marxism\u2019? \u2013 [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This \\[index funds\\] is very much like the bubble in synthetic asset-backed CDOs before the Great Financial Crisis. It will be the Greatest Speculative Bubble of All Time in All Things \u2013 [Michael Burry](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-has-found-the-next-market-bubble.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is Passive Investment Actively Hurting the Economy? - [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-passive-investment-actively-hurting-the-economy)\n\nBut at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week\u2019s issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \\[1\\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!\n\n**The Problem**\n\nThe argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)\n\nIf you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes\n\n**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**\n\nThe problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)\n\nIf you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \\[2,3\\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.\n\nAdding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it\u2019s something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it\u2019s not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\\[4\\].\n\nNow that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder\n\n**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**\n\nI believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)\n\nThe above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).\n\nFinally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.\n\n**Alternatives to index funds**\n\nWhile researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.\n\nAs of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN &amp; FB) account for more than 23% of the S&amp;P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.\n\nThere are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation\n\n[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&amp;P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)\n\n[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&amp;P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!\n\nWhile the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!\n\nUntil next week :)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (&gt;90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!\n\n\\[2\\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing\u2019s efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.\n\n\\[3\\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.\n\n\\[4\\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other.",

I am a salesperson at a Large FCA Store (Stellantis) Dealership in the midwest, and we are sitting on less vehicles today for sale in September, 2021 than we had in July, 2021. \n\n**Ram trucks factories are shut down right now.

Everything that requires a button in your car, fire stick remote controller, xbox controller, keyboard etc... requires a semi conductor.\n\nThe problem with the vehicle shortage is that the vehicle manufactures planned to schedule less chips in February 2021 for the vehicles of 2021 sales. They thought they would sell less vehicles this year because of the Covid, however, earlier this year, things opened and mask came off.  The car manufactures decided to instead order the same amount of chips as they usually do yearly, but the orders were already booked for other manufactures that needed chips. This is why you dont see a shortage in Smart phones, and computers, or TVS. The chip factories are producing chips for them first now before they can produce for car manufactures. It isn't because of a covid factory shut down...\n\nThis gives me reason to believe that demand will only increase for Semi Conductors and since TSM holds the most market in this area and they can generally control pricing. \n\nThis shows that the demand of current electrical devices int he world is actually far greater than we expected!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolid LongTerm Lifetime investment company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*At todays share price on September 3rd, 2021*\n\n*The P/E Ratio of TSM is 32X* \n\n*Apple P/E Ratio is 29X*\n\n*Microsoft P/E ratio is 37X*\n\n*Tesla P/E ratio is 170X*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Average analyst target of $147/share.*\n\nHigh of $200 and Low of $105\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n TSMC formed in 1987, located HQ in Hsinchu, Taiwan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xnxfeghadl71.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=439f443755a78bf1d3196f0dbf40094a440d3308\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1on5sfgiadl71.jpg?width=881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daec6d79172b837788407a8a9aa424e314dc045c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyjqrmekadl71.jpg?width=280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d23b13907924b9618d8f9def091308fbe0b0227\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dm7llfz59dl71.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0f312c9e543ffed4b23af9e395ced2ee39513dd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5o61y339dl71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b523709807728fb9e2e3493a8049ab218f24da6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/um88hin29dl71.jpg?width=1504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5552a028558c76441675d3bec3cedb4a722e5cd1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wv6gsi509dl71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f984f64edabdb85ef83e3ae665395b55e299a0b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwgxhayfcdl71.jpg?width=2119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a610a0371e7d27e6506ddec9a2f3ffbdea533bd2\n\nToday i bought 100 calls, (2 days after earnings) purchase and am expecting more long term purchased investments into this company.

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.\n\nWhich brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.\n\nHere's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)\n\nUnless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.\n\nAnother thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&amp;A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.\n\nI'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6jpncvw6dm71.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a7eca7bafa3737ba33fe74f0f222748a3175370",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nMy main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.\n\nI am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. \n\nI back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.\n\n[Back Testing Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=22&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=AAPL&amp;allocation1_1=20&amp;symbol2=AMZN&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;symbol3=GOOGL&amp;allocation3_1=20&amp;symbol4=MSFT&amp;allocation4_1=20&amp;symbol5=TSLA&amp;allocation5_1=20)",

        "selftext": "When I started trading I was trying to follow the mantra of \"don't invest more than you're willing to lose.\" This resulted in sort of a max of $400-500 that I would put in per individual stock and I definitely had too many going at once to see any legit profit. \n\nI have also read that I should have specific rules set and follow them, setting emotions aside. With this, I have set my initial investment around $1-2K as well as buying puts to hedge potential drops and/or setting Stop Limits for a % I would be willing to lose. My goal is to hit around a 20-30% ROI before selling. There are a few I plan to just buy and Hold, but others I would like to swing trade over the span of a few months. \n\nThe more I think about it, wouldn't it be better to put far more (10-20K) into a stock that is very likely to increase in value over time, like blue chip stocks - wait for it to drop to a 20-50 day MA, invest and look to get out when that 20% is hit. \n\nBut you can't time the market! I know, I know but stocks like MSFT, AAPL, JNJ, PG and many others aren't likely to just drop to 0 even if they do have a pullback (which is when I would buy). Plus, I would have purchased a Put and/or set a stop loss with what I'm comfortable losing. \n\nHow hard do you all go in on your initial investment and do you really need to up the ante to see consistently high returns?

I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.\n\nWhich brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.\n\nHere's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)\n\nHere are my positions: [https://i.imgur.com/5s6tFfe.png](https://i.imgur.com/5s6tFfe.png)\n\nUnless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.\n\nAnother thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&amp;A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.\n\nI'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nMy main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.\n\nI am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. \n\nI back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.\n\n[Back Testing Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=22&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=AAPL&amp;allocation1_1=20&amp;symbol2=AMZN&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;symbol3=GOOGL&amp;allocation3_1=20&amp;symbol4=MSFT&amp;allocation4_1=20&amp;symbol5=TSLA&amp;allocation5_1=20)",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone. Happy Saturday and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months\u2026\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs\u2026however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid\u2026.\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be\u2026however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially\u2026.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 8, 2021**\n\n*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight. Stock currently around $856. ASML is probably the most important and influential tech company you\u2019ve never heard of.\n* Chipotle (CMG) with two target raises. Stock c currently around $1905\n   * Cowen from $2080 from $2250 at Overweight\n   * BTIG Research from $1850 to $2150 at Outperform\n* Coupa Software with a host of target raises following earnings. Average price target $300 at Overweight. Stock currently around $250\n* Microsoft (MSFT) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $335 to $345 at Buy. Stock currently around $300\n* Netflix (NFLX) target raised by JP Morgan from $625 to $705 at Overweight. Stock currently around $605\n* UiPath (PATH) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $72 to $74 at Overweight. Stock currently around $56\n* State Street (STT) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $117 to $122 at Overweight. Stock currently around $87\n* Atlassian (TEAN) target raised by Robert W Baird from $345 to $400 at Outperform. Stock currently around $382\n* Upstart (UPST) target raised by Piper Sandler from $192 to $300 at Outperform. Stock currently around $274\n\n\u201cNumberless are the world's wonders, but none More wonderful than man.\u201d - Sophocles",

And its stock is inexpensive. \nBy Eric J. Savitz \n\nThis should be a magical moment for Plantronics, the producer of conference-room products and office headsets, better known as Poly. \n\nWith a gradual return to the office, there is expected to be a surge in \"hybrid meetings\" -- mixing in-person and virtual participants. Poly CEO Dave Shull estimates that there are about 50 million conference rooms globally, and that 10% or less are equipped for videoconferencing. That is a huge potential opportunity for Poly (ticker: POLY) and its competitors. \n\nShares of Poly, meanwhile, have been driven down to bargain-basement levels by the fallout from an ill-fated merger three years ago. At a recent $32, the stock now trades for about 0.7 times anticipated revenue for the March 2023 fiscal year, and just under eight times projected profits for the same period. \n\nIn comparison, Logitech International (LOGI), which has an overlapping set of products, trades for about 3.2 times revenue and 22 times projected profits for the same period. \n\nAt such deeply discounted levels, investors willing to be patient could reap rich rewards as a turnaround gets underway at Poly.",

        "selftext": "TOM SIEBEL: Well I think we're right on track with what we communicated when we took the company public. So far, we've exceeded expectations every quarter. We're on the growth trajectory that we projected. We have become the world's leading provider of enterprise AI applications.\n\nWe just formed a very, very strategic relationship with Google Cloud where the almost 4,000-strong sales person organization at Google Cloud will be selling all of our applications globally, so that dramatically increases our sales capacity, say, by a couple of orders of magnitude.\n\nAnd I think the company's right on track, and you know, I don't really watch the stock price day to day. That's not my job. I think, as far as I'm concerned, we have $1 billion cash in the bank. We have enough money to do what we need to do. The market can just close for five years, and I think if it opens, then all the shareholders will be happy.\n\n- Some strong words. I was going to ask you about the stock move. I know you don't like to comment on it, but we are seeing it under some pressure today, so I just wonder what you think investors are missing in terms of the growth story that C3 AI is on right now.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, let's think about this. We deliver 40 turnkey enterprise AI applications a day, for banking, for manufacturing, for oil and gas, financial services, telecommunications, and manufacturing. Google Cloud decided they wanted-- these are very, very high value applications, where these companies are realizing billions of dollars a year annual economic benefit from these apps.\n\nNow, the Google Cloud decided that they wanted to change the competitive dynamics of the hyperscaler market, and lead with turnkey enterprise applications rather than CPU seconds and storage as they compete against the other hyperscalers.\n\nIt's a new think about this in terms of, maybe they needed to approach a partner who had a portfolio of applications like that. How many doors are there to knock on in the world? There's virtually only one. We're the only company in this business. We're the only pure play in enterprise application software in the world, in applications, other than, say, toys. Like, toys would be storage, or toys would be virtualization, or toys would be a machine learning library. We don't deliver toys, we deliver applications.\n\nSo we're the only company in this game. This is a-- probably a $300 to $400 billion addressable market, and I think we're going about establishing a market leadership position in that space, and that's the big picture. And I think we have three, four, five, ten years to execute that strategy. If we execute it, this will be one of the great technology companies in the world.\n\n- Yeah, let's use that five year frame here, then. Because you know, I felt like when we were at the IPO stage, right? When was that? A year ago, more than a year ago, right? When we're looking at the growth rate, right? And you came on, and you were kind of honest about, we're not going to run 75% growth all the time. It's going to moderate a little bit, and we've seen that now in terms of, kind of, subscription revenue here up 29%, total revenue up 29% year over year.\n\nI mean, when you look at that five year time frame, and position it where the stock's trading now, I mean, what is it that you would tell investors about where you'll be in five years if all the things pan out? The Google Cloud partnership, and also the government contracts that it sounded like analysts might not have been projecting quite correctly.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, I think, you know, again, whatever the stock did this morning is, you know, it'll do what it does. And the 29% growth rate will put us in the top decile, certainly, of high growth companies in enterprise application software. The analysts' predictions are that our growth rate will accelerate in the coming years.\n\nAnd I think the company is right on track. It's all good. I think we're very pleased. We're pleased with our Microsoft partnership, our Google partnership, our Baker Hughes partnership, FIS partnership. This company is right on track, and I'm quite pleased with the results.\n\n- You've got a pretty broad footprint right now across sectors, whether that's in manufacturing or financials. A long list here in terms of your research on enterprise AI. Where are you seeing the biggest growth right now? What are you most excited about?\n\nTOM SIEBEL: I think in the long run-- so today, we're huge in energy, oil and gas-- excuse me, energy efficiency, telecommunications, manufacturing, aerospace, defense, intelligence. In the long run, I'm personally most excited about precision health. Precision health will be the largest commercial application of AI, where we will be able to do very precise disease prediction, and therefore be able to intervene clinically and avoid the diagnosis.\n\nWe'll have AI-assisted medicine, genome specific medical protocols. I think the economic and social benefits that will accrue from applying AI to precision health are going to be really staggering. This will-- people will live longer, they will be healthier, we will deliver health care at lower cost, and we will do it-- we'll deliver-- using devices like this, we will be delivering health care to a massively large, previously underserved communities.\n\nSQUEEEEZE!

        "selftext": "In April 2020, ecommerce spending exploded globally. In 8 short weeks, US ecommerce spending as a % of total retail sales grew from 16% to 27%. $SHOP and $AMZN have seen their TAM grow massively and their valuations have grown to reflect this.\n\nWhat if I told you something very similar is happening right now in enterprise SaaS?\n\nAmazingly, in 2020, cloud/SaaS spending is still only 9.1% of total global IT spend. But this in changing. Spending on  cloud/SaaS is expected to grow by 18.4% in 2021 alone.\n\nMuch in the same way that the pandemic has made ecommerce a core part of any retail company\u2019s strategy, it has made SaaS a core part of every company\u2019s plans.\n\nOn-premise software just doesn\u2019t make sense in a remote-first world.\n\nJust like Amazon and Shopify have benefited from the eccommerce explosion, companies like $WDAY, $CRM, $MSFT and $OKTA will benefit from the SaaS explosion.\n\nRead more here: https://tadhg.substack.com/p/the-saas-market-opportunity-is-way",

        "selftext": "TLDR\n\nThis article was written by Dogefather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u203a who ascertains as a result of research \u203a to provide thorough \u203a readable \u203a analysis. His trading strategy is Long only \u203a Value \u203a Growth \u203a with a medium to long-term horizon. Dogeboy is generally wary of tech stocks \u203a as this sector is ripe for disruption. However \u203a due to TEAM's steady predictability &amp; rapidly growing revenues \u203a he aggressively solicits a posture of Atlassian long game \u203a as one can make room in a portfolio for tech companies that are the disruptors &amp; carry a moat. \n\nConnected Enterprise\n\nAtlassian \u203a TEAM \u203a produces software that helps teams work together more efficiently &amp; effectively \u203a offering a broad set of \u203a easy to deploy &amp; use tools \u2933 Jira \u203a Confluence \u203a Bitbucket \u203a Trello.\n\n83% of Fortune 500 companies use Atlassian software products \u203a utilized by more than 212K customers at both large &amp; small organizations \u203a for open teamwork models &amp; autonomous project planning &amp; management \u203a that provides an environment for enterprises to experiment &amp; optimize employee experience \u203a for frictionless work environments \u203a business partners \u203a in a connected vendor ecosystem \u203a for easy interaction back &amp; forth &amp; quick response to market signals \u203a &amp; connect with customers \u203a to deepen relationships via those processes.\n\nAs teamwork becomes increasingly digital \u203a investing in a connected enterprise is the clear path forward for 10 million monthly active users who use Atlassian cloud collaboration management tools &amp; help desk solutions \u203a to support a variety of collaboration styles &amp; provide standardization to innovate &amp; cut costs. \n\nAtlassian operates in 4 segments \u2933 1 \u203a subscriptions \u203a term licenses &amp; cloud agreements \u2933 2 \u203a maintenance \u203a annual maintenance contracts that provide support &amp; periodic updates &amp; are generally attached to perpetual license sales \u2933 3 \u203a perpetual license \u203a upfront sale for indefinite usage of the software \u2933 4 \u203a other \u203a training \u203a strategic consulting &amp; revenue from the Atlassian Marketplace app store.\n\nFirst Mover Advantage\n\nWhat sets Atlassian apart is its first mover advantage in its core market. Given the time sensitive nature &amp; delivery windows of most software projects \u203a most of Atlassian's customers simply don\u2019t have the appetite for risking project execution nor the time to adopt a new platform. This has resulted in creating a moat \u203a  as there are indirect costs associated with the learning curve &amp; switching altogether to another platform. \n\nAtlassian delivers the tools &amp; platforms that developers need to build applications \u203a with every company in every sector becoming a software-driven company \u203a there will be almost infinite demand for new applications. As developers raced to build new applications to help their companies cope with the pandemic \u203a they gravitated toward the tools that enabled them to work the fastest &amp; most efficiently. Every company from the smallest mom &amp; pop shop to the largest multinational realized with utmost clarity that they would live or die by software.\n\n\u201cWe are a multi-product company. We differ from many companies that get product/market fit &amp; grow to $500 million in revenue before their second product. We introduced a second product \u203a Confluence \u203a before we reached that scale. We found that customers perceived that software documentation is poor \u2014 we developed a product for document collaboration that\u2019s like a Google Doc on steroids. We have multi-product in our DNA. We now have 14 different products.\u201d \u2933 Cameron Deatsch - Chief Revenue Officer.\n\nAtlassian applies the now-popular agile systems development mindset to all its operations. \n\n\u201cAs far as process \u203a we use an agile approach. This differs \u203a from the traditional waterfall approach \u203a in which system requirements are developed over two years &amp; handed off to the systems development people to build. With agile \u203a we start with customer goals &amp; iteratively build versus the goals. Every two weeks we ship something &amp; learn from it. We can apply this approach to marketing \u203a closing the books \u203a &amp; so on. We have daily stand-ups &amp; two week sprints.\"\n\nCustomer Growth\n\nAtlassian products meet a unique market need for business customers \u203a modernizing collaboration through human-centered technology \u2933 including office productivity tools \u203a video conferencing platforms \u203a file synchronization \u203a sharing solutions \u203a content management apps &amp; more \u2933 empowering companies to design experiences that unlock less fragmented workflows &amp; bring people together in seamless \u203a interconnected &amp; digital experiences.\n\nThey are able to land customers at a low cost with little human intervention. In the latest quarter \u203a Atlassian brought in 17k new customers who never talked to people at Atlassian or its partners \u203a equating to a robust 9.5% sequential QoQ growth \u203a driven by 5.7k  Trello accounts \u203a as a result of new product features &amp; TEAM\u2019s recent sales funnel optimization initiatives.\n\nThe addressable market size in total is an estimated $125 billion \u203a in terms of potential users \u203a including 800 million knowledge workers at the highest level \u203a drilling down to 100 million technical team members &amp; 23 million software developers. Atlassian noted\u00a0during the recent industry conference \u203a the company continues to out its online ecosystem \u203a with a marketplace for over 4k apps that utilize its product technology \u2933 recently launched Forge \u203a which provides runtime for these apps.\n\nAtlassian invents new products through processes propelled by its employees. \u203a it builds on its strengths \u2933 a focus on teams\u203a of which there are many different kinds in different industries \u203a come up with new products by looking at customer use cases &amp; trends outside the norm. Service management is the fastest growing product.\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nAtlassian continues its strong track record of growth \u203a Q3\u201921 revenue growing 38% YoY \u203a driven by subscription revenue growth of 43% YoY. Subscription now comprises 62% of TEAM\u2019s total revenue &amp; its recurring nature helps to smooth out the revenue stream \u203a resulting in higher predictability.\n\nAtlassian has grown impressively over the past few years because it adopts a low-cost web-based marketing &amp; lean transactional operating model \u203a going without a traditional enterprise salesforce &amp; marketing team. Atlassian has a large opportunity ahead \u203a demonstrating strong profitability relative to peers \u203a with a gross profit margin of 84% \u203a far higher than the 49% sector average \u203a a strong balance sheet &amp; plenty of cash to fund future growth initiatives \u203a its FCF margin is 43% \u203a comparing favorably to 12.6% sector median. \n\nGiven the subscription-heavy nature of the business \u203a Atlassian's revenue stream has resulted in sequential quarterly revenue growth over at least the past 3 years &amp; this includes pandemic quarters. Atlassian stopped new sales of server license \u203a increased pricing &amp; created pull-forward effects that incentivize users to renew early \u203a leading to strong revenue &amp; billings growth. Atlassian has demonstrated impressive revenue growth since its IPO in 2015 \u203a growing by 513% over this timeframe to $1.96 billion for the trailing 12 months. Atlassian maintains a fortress balance sheet to fund growth initiatives, with $1.56 billion in cash &amp; short-term investments \u203a no long-term debt, and just $206M in capital leases.\n\nTEAM has outperformed the market in the last year with a price return of \u2191 91.4% while the SPY ETF gained \u2191 30.1%. TEAM has also outperformed the stock market ETF in the last 3 month &amp; 2 week periods returning \u2191 62.1% &amp; \u2191 11.3% \u203a respectively \u203a SPY returned \u2191 8.3% &amp; \u2191 3.2%. Last quarter \u203a Atlassian reported $560 million in Revenue &amp; $.24 earnings per share \u203a this beat revenue expectation by $35 million &amp; exceeded earnings estimates by $.06.\n\nValuation\n\nPotential for competition from legacy software provider Microsoft \u203a MSFT \u203a in the space in which TEAM operates. Atlassian will directly compete against ServiceNow \u203a NOW \u203a as it encroaches on the service desk space. Atlassian\u2019s formal planning processes are adjusted so it can adapt to new threats or opportunities. That\u2019s what happened last year when a competitor\u2019s IPO gave it extra capital to spend on marketing to Atlassian\u2019s customers. Atlassian reprioritized go-to-market resources to keep customer acquisition up in light of that competitor\u2019s spending. One product leader got less. They have OKRs &amp; they adjust.\n\nDisclosure\n\nWithout data \u203a you're just another \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f with an opinion \u2933 Dogeboy\u2019s 17 Sep 21 calls are \u2191 770%",

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

        "selftext": " ( NOTE : this stock was originally brought to my attention by RamenNoodles1776, although im adding various things on to it, the backbone of the argument is by the noodle man )\n\n**introduction**\n\nAlright you pieces of shit, it's time for post #2, and this time it's a less substantiated boy: Cyxtera ( CYXT ). They're a global leader in data center colocation and interconnection services. Now if you're brain dead like I am, I'll tell you what that means : in essence their business is based in a variety of data analyzing, managing, and protection services ( cyber shit ). Now normally this wouldn\u2019t mean much, BUT due to Biden\u2019s push for cybersecurity as of late, as well as several other factors, it's actually incredibly well poised to explode and reach andromeda.\n\n**Bullet time**\n\nNow i could post all about their earnings, volume movement, target estimation, outlook, but you\u2019re lazy ass doesn't want to look at that so I'll just be loud, quick and decisive with some handy dandy bullet points :\n\n* In the last week or so their stocks has increased 10%\n* Still merely under 10$ in price per share, their so low right now that an increase in their price would magnify gains greater than any blue-chip could reach\n* Regardless of the actual performance of the company their placement as a market leader gives them an intrinsic advantage in data service opportunities provided by the government ( oooooo big boy words )\n* Considering major companies like google, Microsoft and amazon all have extremely large portions of themselves dedicated to data, it is not unwise to assume \n\n**The Real shit**\n\n\\****Alright time for some fuckin graphs.***\n\nThis first graph provides information regarding the speculated data services over the next 6 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwlp3sozc7l71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9efc951faee4b1adab0d77263cd28468fcf14181\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5op8tozc7l71.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4c17582bc4ff91cb4afd762eda89278631e67b0\n\nNow, if you have eyes, one can see that this is clearly an exponential trend which would of course coincide with a positive change in CYXT\u2019s stock price as well. Now you may ask yourself \u201c well why hasn't it gone up yet then ya fuckin doofus\u201d. Well ya piece of shit, I'll tell you : amazon and other companies like it have been mostly monopolizing data services and Cyxtera hasn\u2019t been in a position to fight back. HOWEVER, Biden has made a strong push towards antitrust scrutiny of amazon and other such companies. Thus allowing for it to get a foothold that will allow it to hulk jump into space. \n\nAs was said before, its a major data management company but it\u2019s been faced with a variety of compounding factors that's been holding it down, with the biggest being : IT'S PRETTY NEW.\n\nIt's not just coming out dicks swinging right outta the gate it has to first develop a reputation and develop itself before people start putting money into it, and the time for that is very close at hand.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nBuy it or don\u2019t buy it, no matter what your choice is, feel free to...\n\n# Suck my meat on soft\n\nSummary : ( courtesy of RamenNoodles1776 )\n\nCyxtera finally hit 1.5 billion market cap, this new spac venture is well positioned to take advantage of Biden's push for cyber security. They are the third largest data colocation center in the world and went public with the svac spac purchase in august, which is now CYXT. They essentially have a secure path to hold all of business data acting as a giant server that has locations all over the world.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n*Noodle man Disclaimer, I do have a small amount of call options out through November on CYXT (after their quarterly report) and am in no way a financial advisor. This is an opportunity my amatuer self has noticed, let me know what you all think.*",

Spending on  cloud/SaaS is expected to grow by 18.4% in 2021 alone.\n\nMuch in the same way that the pandemic has made ecommerce a core part of any retail company\u2019s strategy, it has made SaaS a core part of every company\u2019s plans.\n\nOn-premise software just doesn\u2019t make sense in a remote-first world.\n\nJust like Amazon and Shopify have benefited from the eccommerce explosion, companies like $WDAY, $CRM, $MSFT and $OKTA will benefit from the SaaS explosion.\n\nRead more here: https://tadhg.substack.com/p/the-saas-market-opportunity-is-way",

        "selftext": " My portfolio is quite tech heavy right now, stocks and ETF. I do like investing in tech but I want to diversify more. I have two tax-free accounts, and I intend to keep most of these stocks and ETFs for a long period of time. Here's what I have right now:\n\nTFSA **(holding 5+ years)**\n\n9% - AAPL\n\n10% - ASTS\n\n8% - CRSR\n\n17% - MSFT\n\n17% - QQQ\n\n15% - SMH\n\n24% - VGT\n\nLike I said, super tech heavy. I'm also aware of the big overlap. This is an account I'm willing to take more risks with. Looking to add some clean energy, cyber security and other \"future tech\" ETFs. Any recommendations?\n\nRRSP **(holding 30+ years):**\n\n40% - SCHD\n\n40% - VYM\n\n20% - VOO\n\nThis is very focused on dividends, since this account is tax-free for gains and dividends, and I'm not willing to take as much risk with this one. Any thoughts?\n\nStill very new to stocks and ETFs, looking for any type of feedback.",

        "selftext": "What\u2019s up my stoner friends. I re-rolled all the highlights from last week to this Monday on the stock market.  \n\nNon-farm data came out last Friday. It brought some concerns to the market, but I\u2019m gonna stick to my plan and keep buying more promising stocks. \n\n# Highlights:\n\n# 1. Non farm data2. Reddit IPO  3. Windows11 launches on 10/5\n\n\\-\n\n# Non farm payrolls out \n\nThe rising of Delta cases caused a dramatic drop - the monthly employment numbers went WAY lower than expected: 23.5k VS 72.5K, the unemployment rate also dropped to 5.2% compared to July.  \n\nMany experts consider this a signal of postponing \u201c the taper,\u201d which is a clear sign of slower growth along with uncertainty in the market. However, as wages and unemployment rate shows, it\u2019s not as bad as it looks. \n\nIn this case, I remain bullish in the short run. \n\n\\-\n\n# Reddit IPO = WSB IPO? \n\nThe birthplace of our beloved MEME stock, Reddit, is seeking to hire advisers for their IPO next year to GIT MORE $$$$. Targeting a 15$ billion valuation when listed on the stock market. I\u2019m expecting mayhem on meme stocks a week before Reddit\u2019s IPO.  We\u2019ll sit and wait before the show begins.  \n\n\\-\n\n# Windows 11 is one month away\n\nThe long awaited new windows OS will be released on October 5th as MSFT recently announced. It will be a free upgrade for you as long as you have a legit windows 10 in your devices. \n\nThat being said, as usual, the upgrade will roll out in phases - current windows 10 users will likely be offered an upgrade weeks after new products. Analysts estimate it will contribute 19% of MSFT\u2019s profit for 2021.  \n\nI personally am a big fan of MSFT in terms of their business model and outlook. New OS seems pretty decent and clean. So I will be adding more MSFT into my long term portfolio. Again. \ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you feel the same way about Windows11, also checkout my take on MSFT here:   \n\n\nAlthough it won\u2019t be as nice and peaceful as last week, I\u2019m still expecting slightly bullish on the market this week ahead overall.  Uncertainty isn\u2019t a bearish sign in this case as nothing fundamentally impacts the market in the short run.   \n\n\nThanks for your time, good luck and stay high.",

        "selftext": "Netflix, even though it didnt break 600 yesterday, its certainly still bullish and especially after being in a channel for the last 7 months, i think its due for a break out relatively soon. Also with the miss in jobs and more stimulus entering the market as well as the tapering not starting until November (probably) Id say this next week is a break out week . Now i could be completely wrong and netflix could again go back down to low 500s but idk TA showed a strong support at 580s. \n\nI dont have any positions in it yet but plan on opening a call.\n\nModerna , on the weekly chart it shows that the stock has been respecting the lower 300s support and just now is breaking out of that 3ish week long channel , we will see what happens next week but over all im bullish on it after that break out, i have a few calls for next week and hoping they print.\n\nMsft, I  love this stock, one thing about it is that after it breaks out it consolidates for a bit before breaking out again. Its been coslidating around 300s for a while now so im expecting a break out soon. Plan on opening a position in it after seeing next weeks price action.\n\nFacebook \\^ same applies as msft.\n\nGoogle is a monster expecting it to probably each 3k this week if im being honest, usually after a pull google hits new highs and it did have a pull back this friday so yeah.\n\nOther than that i really have nothing else to say except whats yalls views on these stocks? Also what do yall use for TA? I tend to use 5,20,50,200 emas , vwap and the regular trend lines on the daily and weelky chart how about yall?",
