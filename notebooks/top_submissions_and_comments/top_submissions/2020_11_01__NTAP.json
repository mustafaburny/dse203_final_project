        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n&gt; Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&amp;P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n&gt; November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n&gt; Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs report\n&gt; There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n&gt; Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n&gt; Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n&gt; December is now the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&amp;P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n&gt; For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n&gt; Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n&gt; Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&amp;P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n&gt; Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n&gt; Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n&gt; There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n&gt; The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&amp;P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&amp;P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n&gt; On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&amp;P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n&gt; In aggregate, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&amp;P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&amp;P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n&gt; What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n&gt; Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n&gt; Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&amp;P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&amp;P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n&gt; Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&amp;P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n&gt; The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n&gt; Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&amp;P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n&gt; November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n&gt; Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs report\n&gt; There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n&gt; Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n&gt; Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n&gt; December is now the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&amp;P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n&gt; For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n&gt; Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n&gt; Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&amp;P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n&gt; Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n&gt; Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n&gt; There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n&gt; The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&amp;P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&amp;P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n&gt; On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&amp;P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n&gt; In aggregate, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&amp;P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&amp;P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n&gt; What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n&gt; Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n&gt; Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&amp;P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&amp;P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n&gt; Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&amp;P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n&gt; The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into \u201921, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn\u2019t only about the US anymore.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days.

        "selftext": "**US equities mostly lower: Dow (0.45%), S&amp;P 500 (0.34%), Nasdaq +0.07%, Russell 2000 (0.45%)**\n\n* US equities mostly lower in Thursday midday trading after putting in a mixed performance in prior session. Value underperforming growth for a second straight session following big pro-cyclical rotation early in the week. Financials, energy, materials among the worst performers. Comm services, tech, healthcare outperforming. Treasuries stronger with the curve bull flattening. Dollar weaker vs yen and euro but firmer vs sterling. Gold up 0.9%. WTI up 0.7%.\n* **No big directional drives in play thus far today**. Path of least resistance has recently been higher on vaccine optimism, removal of election overhang, continued monetary policy tailwind and earnings resilience. Key areas of concern revolve around worsening coronavirus trends and the potential for a scaled-down stimulus package. Much of the focus over the last few days has been on what is going on below the surface in terms of a rotation from growth and momentum to value and cyclicals. A number of strategists have said rotation has more room to run but some have questioned sustainability, highlighting lack of traction behind prior moves.\n* **Resurgent coronavirus cases, an increase in hospitalizations and new restrictions continue to dominate the headlines**. However, new wave may be cresting in European hot spots. Vaccine optimism still elevated with MRNA-US completing case accrual for interim analysis. **Politics the other big story** **though market implications limited for now**. Trump campaign trying to block certification of Biden victory in key states but reports noted the futility of these legal challenges. Biden named longtime advisor Ron Klain as chief of staff, as widely expected. Also reassured allies on regional security in calls with leaders of Japan, South Korea and Australia. On the economic front, **weekly initial and continuing jobless claims lower** than consensus and **October CPI lighter** on both headline and core readings.\n* Not much corporate news though tonight brings first batch of higher-profile Oct Q reporters with **CSCO-US** and **NTAP-US** . **DIS-US** also reports after the close. Focus next week will be on the retailers, which should provide more insight into the consumer resilience theme. **VRM-US** , **ENR-US** , **SBH-US** , **GOCO-US** and **GDRX-US** the notable post-earnings decliners today. **FOSL-US** , **IGT-US** , **HI-US** , **TTEK-US** and **SDGR-US** the standouts. **LUV-US** said it has seen a deceleration in improving trends that could be partly related to resurgent coronavirus cases. **UTZ-US** to acquire On The Border tortilla chips for $480M.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+27.7% **FOSL-US** (Fossil): Q3 EPS positive though revenue lower y/y; cash position better, debt lower than previously announced levels in July; management said while it expects COVID to impact Q4 sales, highlighted ecomm strength.\n* \\+7.5% **SDGR-US** (Schr\u00f6dinger): Q3 earnings and revenue beat; highlighted strength in Software in both life sciences and materials segments (though some y/y weakness in drug discovery revenue); said do not expect a long-term impact from pandemic.\n* \\+4.4% **MRNA-US** (Moderna, Inc.): Completed case accrual for the first interim analysis of phase three trial of coronavirus vaccine candidate and with increased case identification over the past week it will include well more than the minimum case number; Dr Fauci, director of NIAID, has recently speculated the Moderna vaccine could be as effective as the candidate from PFE-US and BNTX-US .\n* \\+4.1% **IGT-US** (International Game Technology Plc): Q3 earnings and revenue beat; highlighted strongest Lottery comps in seven quarters (NA a bright spot); noted some positive sequential trends in Global Gaming as casinos reopen and installed base gradually reactivated.\n* \\+3.4% **TTEK-US** (Tetra Tech): FQ4 earnings beat with revenue and guidance mostly in line to stronger; analysts noted record order backlog, strong EBIT margins across segments on upmarket demand and strong execution, continued strength in government business.\n* \\+2.9% **HI-US** (Hillenbrand): FQ4 earnings and revenue missed; highlighted boost from Milacron acquisition and said Batesville remaining unseasonably strong; engineered plastics a bright spot, driving y/y backlog improvement; next-Q EPS guide above the Street.\n* \\+2.2% **NOW-US** (ServiceNow): Upgraded to overweight from equal weight at Morgan Stanley; sees Workflow Automation platform as a beneficiary of Covid-related work from home trends, expects strong growth and better margins; raised price target.\n* \\+1.7% **SMG-US** (Scotts Miracle-Gro): Upgraded to buy from hold at Berenberg; cited record growth across both segments on strong consumer and professional demand; also noted upside from recent election results that could lead to more cannabis legislation in the near-term.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-17.4% **GOCO-US** (GoHealth, Inc.): Q3 earnings beat but revenue missed, guidance in line on revenue and ahead for earnings; analysts noted large mix shift away from commission revenue has created confusion, competitors have raised FY guidance on strong start to AEP while GoHealth did not; management said focus shift towards enterprise revenue is a sustainable driver of earnings.\n* \\-11.1% **ENR-US** (Energizer Holdings): FQ4 earnings and revenue beat though GM light; Covid costs higher than expected; midpoint of FY21 EPS guide a bit below the Street; withdrew pre-pandemic 2022 targets; announced COO LaVigne to replace retiring CEO Hoskins on 1-Jan.\n* \\-9.3% **VRM-US** (Vroom): Q3 revenue, EBITDA, EPS beat; ecomm unit sales missed, TDA units sold at low end of guidance range; guided Q4 EPS, EBITDA below Street; analysts cautions on Q4 ecomm and TDA unit guidance, flagged operational challenges and inventory constraints.\n* \\-6.9% **RVLV-US** (Revolve Group, Inc.): Q3 EBITDA beat but revenue missed; management said COVID has had negative impact on operations since end of Q3 with net sales down HSD in October; analysts also noted limited visibility until vaccine is distributed, flagged loss of market share in quarter.\n* \\-5.6% **SBH-US** (Sally Beauty Holdings): FQ4 earnings beat but revenue missed; comps light across both segments; flagged slower recovery from elements of full-service business and loss of professional sales amid CA salon shutdowns.\n* \\-5.3% **FOXA-US** (Fox Corporation): Axios reported Donald Trump looking to start a digital media offering to compete with Fox News; could be available on a monthly subscription basis; Trump tweeted today that Fox forgot in 2020 what made them successful in 2016.\n* \\-4.9% **GDRX-US** (GoodRx): Q3 EPS and revenue beat; noted higher cost of revenue driven by customer-support expenses and more online provider visits; Q4 and FY guidance a bit better than the Street; analysts flagged Covid impacts on core business.\n* \\-3.3% **MTOR-US** (Meritor): FQ4 earnings and revenue beat; noted lower y/y volumes and decreased demand in Commercial Truck; Aftermarket and Industrial sales weaker than consensus; FY guidance below the Street; approved plant closures as part of restructuring plan.\n* \\-1.1% **LUV-US** (Southwest Air): Company said revenue trends decelerated for November and December, though unclear whether softness directly due to rise in COVID-19 cases; currently estimates Jan-21 capacity to decrease by 35-40% y/y, little changed from Q4 levels.\n\n10:35:17 AM CST on 12 Nov '20",

        "selftext": "OKTA - Q3FY2021 on December 2nd\n\nIdentity and access management. \nUp 42.7% YoY in Revenues, down 39.38% in Earnings. Momentum has been non-existent since summer; I\u2019m calling it a pass. \n\nSNOW - Q3FY2021 on December 2nd\n\nCloud-based data warehousing, price holding steady since the IPO in September. Revenue and  Earnings climbing YoY, but both earnings and profit margins are still strongly in the red. \n\nBOX - Q3FY2021 on December 1st \n\nCloud content management and file sharing for B2B. Box Earnings and profit margins are up around 80% YoY, with small gains in revenues. Box is seeing a reversal of 30-day momentum for the better, which may put it up as a strong play going into December. \n\nCRM - Q3FY2021 on December 1st\n\nEverybody\u2019s favourite cloud based CRM. Salesforce blew Earnings out of the water last quarter, and is running back up after the dip early November. I\u2019m expecting this one to pump a little more leading up to posting earnings, but wouldn\u2019t hold beyond the reporting date. \n\nSPLK - Q3FY2021 on December 2nd \n\nReal-time big data analytics, monitoring and delivery within the enterprise. Revenues and earnings took a significant hit this year, and price has been effectively stagnant since august peaks with no obvious reversal in sight. \n\nCRWD - Q3FY2021 on December 2nd \n\nCrowdstrike provides end point security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Fundamentals have been moving in a positive direction YoY (Revenues up 84%, earnings up 42%) with the stock down from all time highs in October. Analysts are generally feeling good about the company moving towards profitability, but we aren\u2019t seeing the run up yet. \n\nASAN - Q3FY2021 on December 9th\n\nProduct management hipster SaaS. I would just skip this honestly, but that\u2019s a personal bias. \n\nNTAP - Q2FY2021 on December 01st \n\nHybrid cloud data services and data management. NTAP didn\u2019t benefit much from the post-Corona tech rally, but is estimated to post strong earnings, and seems to be rallying into the reporting period. \n\n\nTL;DR: Sector rotation appears to be in effect. I\u2019d look at NetApp and Box as decent longer term choices, with Salesforce and Crowdstrike as possible short term plays until the reporting date (overvalued enough; likely to tank after).",
