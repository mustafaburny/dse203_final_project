        "selftext": "Today I included the aggressive orders, watch tomorrow which of these orders go into OI then you can tell which of these are sitting open.\n\nThese options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and strike. Also lots of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were   breaking down their order to get filled faster.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/Nr5XB8q](https://imgur.com/a/Nr5XB8q)\n\nAlso   all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest    in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either    buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the       aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open.  Some of   these may be  hedges and some most likely not.\n\nYesterday I posted about BAC , CCL, and others. CCL closed down 33% and the flow yesterday bet on a drop so I would say this move in CCL has already been made so all of you would be late, the same for BAC. I don't know what VEEV does enough to give an opinion. I am interested in those GILD calls from yesterday still here, I haven't had time to check if those orders went into OI. -- [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsom2h/aggressive\\_options\\_baccclgildmgmtsla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsom2h/aggressive_options_baccclgildmgmtsla/)\n\nDon't    just  enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most  cases.   Use   technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all  combined    instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if  you worry    about losing what u put in and be  smart, understand the  risks of  putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry.  Learn IV AND IV CRUSH!!\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.\n\nEDIT     - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers,   when  I  am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I   did  in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I   have   different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These   orders   today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the   confidence   level is lower than something extremely aggressive and   unusual like SBUX order flow I posted about in the past.\n\nEDIT    - We are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact.  Technicals say there is more room to fall in the indexes so most    companies should follow.",

        "selftext": "The free market is supposed to be a two way street, but Jpow printed some one way signs, put a construction zone on it, and is directing traffic away so no one sees him filling pot holes with sand. 6.64 million jobless claims, doubles the historical worst, exceeds the grimmest expectations from any major firm, and the market is up with talking heads trying to justify it. Here's what they're not saying: the prop up isn't just the Fed with the unlimited printer to banking institutions, buying ETFs, and backing every loan in the states... it's also the MMs along with exchanges themselves through direct price manipulation intervention. Yeah, I said it. The markets refuse to let this thing go down, and it's not because Jpow's printer makes MSFT go higher, it's because the people who dictate pricing have put parameters in place that limit the downside, artificially inflate bid and ask ratios, volume, all that, to give the illusion of up days when fundamentals, market sentiment, are all down.\n\nThe market is supposed to have its ups and downs, and when we disallow the downs and punt them into the future, the market becomes fake and unstable. Jpow's printer makes the bulls feel good right now, but he's putting them through a castration machine, they just don't know it because the illusion shows them in a massive field with all these hot cows they think they're about to fuck. This up day is very fucking ominous. Might wanna put gloves on those diamond hands and always be ready for the systemic cliff fall, because this is bad.",

Fucking Microsoft Teams is the same thing on a slightly shittier platform, and it's free with Microsoft365. Every company has Teams. Unlike the temporary boost from corona, this cost savings is permanent.\n\n$TSLA started cost savings and the very first thing it did was cancel Zoom Pro subscriptions for every one of its 45,000 employees. It was a straight up overnight decision because they already have Teams. At $15 per employee, Zoom just lost over $6 million in revenue from a single company.\n\nZM 110 P, 4/17",

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm a bit new to this whole investing thing (so pardon the newbiness).\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this is a good time to buy Microsoft. Now, obviously its better to buy now at around $150, rather than when it was at its highs. But, I can't help but think stocks in general have a little ways to go before they hit the bottom.\n\nHowever, since I'm in it for the long haul I don't particularly think it'll matter so much in the long run where I buy in. At least so long as I don't buy the peak.\n\nBut, I'd still like to maximize gains without being too greedy of course. \n\nThoughts and/advice?",
