But Robinhood's restricted list was way bigger and included stocks such as AMD, AAL, BYND, GM, IPOE, MRNA, and SBUX. I had got into stocks in January 2021 as a new years resolution. Which was a couple weeks before the GME stuff and reddit trading was even all over the news. At the time I honestly thought the buying restriction was something a part of the stock market. As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. \n\nNow that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that. They limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside. I really hope that doesn't happen again.",

I since saw the light and YOLO'd my money into TSLA, SHOP, SQ, and some alternative assets, generating interdimensional returns of about 500% in the past year. All of this was on Robinhood. I poured my entire life savings into Robinhood. I even borrowed some money from my mom to invest. (Sadly still tied up in GME @ $380).\n\nI now wanted to buy my first home. I was excited that I could afford it with all of these gainz. I was excited I could make an all cash offer because that's what it takes with these foreign buyers running the market. But then I found out that the evil villains of RobinHood would not allow me to take my money out! RobinHood limits you from withdrawing **a MAXIMUM of $50,000 per BUSINESS DAY.** They're doing you dirty worse than they did to Harambe. \n\nWe must get the word out that **your money in RobinHood is not yours!** \n\nWhat is a good alternative to Robinhood for my $TSLA calls, $PLTR LEAPs, and box spread trades?

President Joe Biden just recently began a 100-day assessment of the risks to supply chains, noting that the US\u2019\u2019 need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semis, EV batteries, and rare earth minerals. This is where E2Open ($ETWO) comes into play.\n\n**COMPANY SUMMARY**\n\n*\u201cLeaders win through logistics. Vision, sure. Strategy, yes. But when you go to war, you need to have both toilet paper and bullets at the right place at the right time. In other words, you must win through superior logistics.\u201d  \\~ Tom Peters*\n\nEssentially an unknown up-and-coming company that provides cloud-based, on-demand supply chain software that offers customers a significant value proposition. ETWO helps customers reduce inventory costs (10-20%), reduce direct materials procurement operating costs (50%), improve inventory forecasts (15-50%), and reduce supply chain staff (15%).\n\nETWO has only recently went public on February 21\u2019, yet this relatively new company has already acquired and secured clients such as Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, AMD, Nike, and many more (See Image Below for a better overall picture of its customer base). Another notable point is it\u2019s founders. According to Wikipedia, *the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.* This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions. The company is also trading very cheap in comparison to it\u2019s fundamentals and it\u2019s peers (Scroll down for a slightly deeper dive).\n\n* *A Snapshot of its largest customer base:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwe5biyquuw61.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2bc97da035fdd0cc0d84e11686aa40166f5c91\n\n* *A Snapshot Of Their Investment Thesis:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1v3wk1uuuw61.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3530ce3826ed67513c7797afd4bb1a3a0d54e56a\n\n**Key Qualities Of ETWO, and Competitive Advantages It Has Over Its Competitors:**\n\n* Multi-enterprise network combining data with best-in-class intelligent applications\n* integrated cloud platform delivering meaning ROI across supply chain\n* First mover advantages from data connectors and harmonization\n* Long term relationships with blue-chip, large enterprise customer base\n* Attractive industry tailwinds and large TAM with significant white space\n* Category-defining End-to-End provider of mission-critical software\n* Strong network effects enhanced by flexible and integrated data model\n\n**Key issues for current supply chains and how $ETWO is solving them:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tm9r4jdyuuw61.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd452f13403ddf6f1c43151b9fca9415d9aa1826\n\n*A Visual Of $ETWO 's business model:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pts7oo10vuw61.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b50c7097f059b98ffb48f2e8134628860fccf700\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nThe stock itself offers value to shareholders due to it\u2019s very cheap valuation compared to its peers, as well as it\u2019s massive potential for growth. At its current valuation, $ETWO is trading at an estimated EV/Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11.7 among it\u2019s peers. It also boasts an EV/EBITDA of 21.3 compared to 29.2 and 59.1 from it\u2019s two closest competitors, Descartes and Kinaxis. \n\nOne of the most important value factors for SaaS platforms is in the recurring cash flow. In $ETWO's case, this comes from it's subscription sales, which provides some much valued predictability in these uncertain times . This is another strength that $ETWO possesses, as the company boasts an extremely low churn rate - which is a an indicator of a massive moat, which can allow $ETWO to retain profits from its competitors. This only further demonstrates that the company is due for strong future growth. Below are some visuals which exemplify the value of ETWO:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Strong Performance on Key Metrics:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wirah1d2vuw61.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75ae35151c09a121def921cb6bd42c03c947c563\n\n* Attractive Long Term Financial Profile:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9intlpp3vuw61.png?width=1869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba50479fab89957024b271cc1223ddb2e25d83a1\n\n* Growth and Profitability:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52quo145vuw61.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93bbeb7ace2f303d45c68a5cf90bd616cff90c8\n\n**What Wallstreet is Saying**\n\n*\u201cIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.  If you think about that, you\u2019ll do things differently.\u201d  \\~ Warren Buffett,*\n\nAlthough it is a relatively new and low profile company (for now), it seems Wall Street is already taking notice. Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company:\n\n*\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"*\n\n**One Final and Intriguing Note:**\n\nA few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it\u2019s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post).\n\nShort Interest:\n\n[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh\\_opt\\_option,sh\\_short\\_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh_opt_option,sh_short_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO)\n\nI am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light.\n\nPut/Call Ratio:\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios)\n\nAnyone interested in some further reading on the company, should check out this solid write up on $ETWO, as it makes some great points that I missed in mine:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl\\_cc\\_neuberger\\_principal\\_holdings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl_cc_neuberger_principal_holdings/)\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nThe cheaply valued ETWO and it\u2019s value proposition, it\u2019s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it\u2019s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist.
