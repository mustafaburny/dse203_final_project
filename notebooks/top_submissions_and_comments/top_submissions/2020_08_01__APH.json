        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

        "selftext": "I firmly expect $OSS to run up into earnings this Thursday and potentially beyond, and I have statistics + leaks from AMD/NVIDIA to back this up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you review their [partnerships](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners) and [financial statements](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-20-013196/0001564590-20-013196.pdf), you start to wonder if their stock price is some kind of joke. They are very clearly doing much better than 95% of the pennystocks mentioned on this subreddit and have an array of high-level connections in their industry. In short, they're not struggling.\n\nNVIDIA cites them as a \"[top system maker](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2050975/0/en/World-s-Top-System-Makers-Unveil-NVIDIA-A100-Powered-Servers-to-Accelerate-AI-Data-Science-and-Scientific-Computing.html)\" and are officially one of NVIDIA's [Preferred Manufacturers](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's rare for a company this young to perform at such a high level. By their SECOND YEAR, they generated $60 million in revenue (57% increase YoY) and already had multiple profitable quarters, which is unheard of. For comparison, they make 60x as much as GNUS, but get 1/60th of the attention. This means we get to be early.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Three Catalysts - Pick your Weapon:\n\n1. Q2 earnings this Thursday, August 6th - Their past earnings have been very very strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Upcoming Siggraph 2020 tech conference (August 17-24) - A showcase of new military-grade Nvidia workstations/datacenters and Nvme PCIe storage/flash products)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Caught in the middle of a dick-measuring contest between AMD/NVIDIA, who both have new GPU architectures coming out (partnered with both). This is a situation that's going to unfold over time. As an OEM for both companies who are targeting PCIe 4.0 systems, OSS is going to be very pleased.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PROMISED LEAKS:**\n\nOSS currently holds the [first and only PCIe 4.0 server expansion system](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/164/oss-introduces-worlds-first-pcie-gen-4-expansion-system) that's compatible with Nvidia's A-100 card, the [most powerful processor in the world](https://www.techpowerup.com/270338/nvidia-ampere-a100-gpu-gets-benchmark-and-takes-the-crown-of-the-fastest-gpu-in-the-world). (benchmarked last week. Highest Octanebench score ever recorded.)\n\nThe CEO hinted that AMD's MI100 would be soon to follow, as [leaks from AMD](https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-cdna-and-mi100-presentation-slides-leak/) are showing specs and the clear intention to target PCIe 4.0 server systems, which OSS currently holds the majority of the market share in.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI could write a novel on this company, but I'm not going to bother. They will do well whether we talk about them or not.\n\nThey recently hired a new CEO, who's led two companies in the same industry to record revenues and one was bought out entirely by Broadcom. He also receives a [massive salary bonus](https://imgur.com/MPDnP9c) if the stock price reaches $5.50. It's clear what their intentions are.\n\nThe CEO did an interview yesterday where he mentioned that they had \"0 Covid cases on the production line\", which further bolsters my firm prediction that their quarterly/annual earnings should be very strong.",

You could've exited anytime on Friday for a profit except the last 15 mins of trading.  AAPL stock split enthusiasm and tiktok buyout rumors by MSFT(now canned) drove it past 325 eclipsing the stimulus paycheck pause\n\nLooking into next week, again for the SPY we need to think in terms of Geopolitik Say AMZN struck a deal in South Asia and MENA regions, they're set to dominate the ecommerce market there, oh just one problem. all the goods from vietnam / US can't get there because the South China Sea is being blockaded. Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages. Whoops won't matter if they are banned in Asia due to US loosing allies over there. Tiktok case is the reverse example of this.\n\nWho makes the most money ultimately comes down to who have MORE GUNS(and wins wars),  we will see how this play out over the next few months along with the rona pandemic. It's been this way for thousands of years ever since Roman times. This view is also echoed by the world's biggest Hedge Funds.\n\n***\"Ray Dalio's, chairman of Bridgewater capital(160B AUM) 2nd article on Geopolitics\"***\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio/)\n\n&gt;Governance between countries is very different from governance within countries.  That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.  Operating internationally is like operating in a jungle in which there is survival of the fittest and most anything goes.  That is what makes having a strong military so important.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where the US Is in Its Big Cycle The stats seem to suggest that the US is roughly 75% through that cycle, +/- 10%.

        "selftext": "The new OSS CEO (David Raun) has some intriguing incentives and a much different skillset than the previous CEO (Steven \"Old News\" Cooper). In general, Steven Cooper's background appears to have been more directly tied to the product line (B.A. in electrical engineering) while David Raun is an experienced CEO with at least one major exit and a focus on profitability. I'll leave the skillset analysis to others, but I thought it might be worth sharing some intriguing bits from the new CEOs compensation package.\n\nThe [CEOs full compensation agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391dex101.htm) (filed with the SEC as an attachment to the [8-k announcing the new CEO hire](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391d8k.htm)) specifies that \"a discretionary bonus provided that the Company\u2019s common stock price reaches $5.50 per share and remains at or above such price for six (6)\u00a0consecutive months\". It doesn't specify the discretionary bonus amount, but I would assume it would be fairly lucrative considering that would represent \\~150% of increased market cap over the time. The CEO Officially started in June and has been interim CEO since February.\n\nHe's got vesting incentives that lock in at the end of Q2 and Q4 which incentivize him to increase the price $0.25 over the previous six months at the end of the period using a weighted average price.\n\nHis compensation agreement went into effect on June 24, 2020, so it's early in the term of the agreement but it's meaningful that this is the goal. The earning report on Thursday represents the end of Q2 so the price run up here matches the incentive to increase the price over the previous six month period. End of the price around Q4 last fiscal year was $1.80ish so they've easily hit the $0.25 price increase milestone with the current \\~$3 price. That said, I believe the end of Q2 (relevant period for the price escalator) was actually approximately June 20-30 at which point the price was hovering around $2.00. \n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n* The board of directors has incentivized the CEO with a price target of $5.50 (average price over 6 month period during the next three years of the agreement period) and stock option vesting escalators if the price increases $0.25 at the end of Q2 and Q4, pro-rated if he doesn't hit it. \n* CEO has previous exit experience PLX Technologies acquired by the company now known as Broadcom (an OSS partner) and the CEO change would seem to be an indication that they are looking to move toward growth/profitability.\n* Strong partnership list including NVIDIA, AMD, and others.\n* [COVID-19 statement](https://www.onestopsystems.com/coronavirus-covid-19-statement) includes this language: \"Due to the medical, military and other critical applications serviced by our products, the US Undersecretary of State has requested that OSS remain in operation and continue to provide the essential critical infrastructure products we manufacture.\" They had some supply crunch early on during COVID-19, [but according to this CEO interview they never stopped the production line.](https://www.channelchek.com/channelcast-detail/157)\n* A diverse product set that ruggedizes computation in a wide set of markets (e.g. military, medical, autonomous vehicles, media and entertainment, etc) where quick decisions need to be made faster than is possible in cloud computing applications.\n\nKey Resources:\n\n* [8K - SEC filing announcing hiring of David Raun as CEO.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391d8k.htm)\n* [CEO Employment Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391dex101.htm)\n* [CEO Interview on OSS product offerings including \"AI on the Fly\" and Edge Computing](https://www.channelchek.com/channelcast-detail/157)\n* [July 21 Corporate Presentation including Customer List, Q1 and Q2 progress, and some fluff.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_e9cdb971205220b8a434fada5addbc0a/onestopsystems/db/354/2817/pdf/OSS+Corporate+Profile+July+2020.pdf) Key customers in industries ranging from aerospace, military/government, medical instrumentation, 5G communications, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nI don't know where this is going, but I like the company's outlook. Long term price outlook is $5.50 at some point over the next three years. I have no idea what's going to happen in the short term.",
