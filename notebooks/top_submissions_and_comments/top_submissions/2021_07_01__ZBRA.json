        "selftext": "Has anyone used a ZEBRA spread to cover a short position? I've never done this before. I have a naked call that's in jeopardy and I thought it might be a good time to experiment. I thought about buying a deep ITM call to turn it into a PMCC, but was curious how that compares to a ZEBRA spread. The zebra is about 1.5x the cost of an 80 delta call and about 40% of the cost of the stock outright. Does this position have any real advantage over just buying shares on margin? The cost is roughly the same.",
