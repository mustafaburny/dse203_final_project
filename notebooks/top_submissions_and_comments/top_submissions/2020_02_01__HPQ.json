        "selftext": "Insider buying on Monday at upscale hotel REIT **Hersha Hospitality Trust** $HT.  Brothers Neil and Jay Shah, President and CEO respectively, bought a combined $100,000 in their seventh joint purchase over the past 6 months in the REIT that owns 48 upscale/luxury  hotels in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC, South Florida, and the West Coast. \n\nValued at 6.1x AFFO Hersha Hospitality Trust already looks cheap with a discount to NAV of 37% and a yield of 8.6% based on an AFFO payout rate of just 56%. \n\nThose metrics should improve further as numerous upgrades have disrupted operations but should start adding to cash flow growth in the near term.  Specifically, two of the REIT\u2019s most profitable hotels in south Florida are operational again (after Hurricane Irma in 2017) and are expected to boost EBITDA by 20-25%.\n\nHotel REITs are out of favor at the moment but $HT\u2019s already cheap valuation offers downside protection while 20%+ AFFO growth provides a tangible catalyst for upside supported by insider buying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Grand Canyon Education** $LOPE dropped 16% to $78 after a Citron report on Tuesday  called it \u201cThe Educational Enron\u201d and lowered their Price Target from $30 to $0\n\n\u201cCitron believes that management of Grand Canyon has been both incompetent and deceitful in its ability to transform the school to adapt to the rapidly changing for profit education space.\u201d\n\nCitron Research also say that \u201c\\[t\\]he corporate structure between Grand Canyon Education and Grand Canyon University is one that the SEC should investigate. GCE\u2019s revenues are almost entirely from Grand Canyon University. Having a captive customer that is 90% of revenues with the same CEO and no \u201cChinese wall\u201d does not pass the smell test.\u201d  Additionally, \u201cCitron believes GCE is stuffing GCU with expenses to inflate its own profitability and as a result bankrupting GCU.\u201d\n\nCitron says \u201cIn light of the significant fraud we have uncovered, we are lowering our Price Target from $30 previously to $0\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Acceleron** jumps 70%, after reporting on Phase 2 trials on Tuesday, but as the only drug for a $10 billion TAM its $4.8bn market cap still looks reasonable\n\nAccording to Fool;\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension is a condition in which a patient has high blood pressure in the lungs. This means that the part of the heart responsible for pumping oxygen to the lungs, the right ventricle, has to work even harder to do its job. Eventually, this can lead to right ventricular failure and death.\n\nAt the moment, there are no drugs that specifically treat PAH and as far as I can see the market is growing and expected to hit $10 billion in 2026.\n\nWith the only cure for a fatal disease, a large market share and big margins would seem reasonable assumption for any forecasts.  Back of the envelope, a 50% share at 20% margins and 14x PE would justify a market cap of $14 billion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft** $MSFT jumped on Wednesday after a strong performance across the board and a thriving cloud business helped revenues and earnings grow 14% and 37% respectively. Guidance suggests the company expects its strong growth to continue and MSFT has a habit of underpromising and overdelivering.  The stock has had a remarkable run up but, even on 30x trailing earnings it still looks like good value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Farfetch** $FTCH jumped 10% after reporting a $250 million investment on Thursday from Tencent and west coast investment firm Dragoneer that will increase the company\u2019s exposure to China and help to finance its technology platform. \n\nFarfetch is a high-end fashion retailer that carries no inventory which is a major advantage when the risk of getting stuck with expensive stock you cannot sell is significant. Instead the company runs an online marketplace where more than 1,000 retailers and 3 million customers from over 50 countries. Growth has been spectacular with revenue increasing by 50%+ for several years in a row.\n\nThis rapid growth has led to increasing networking effects and allows Farfetch to charge a 25% to 33% commission fee on sales made through its site. Current year forecast sales are still modest at just under $1 billion. Equally modest, in comparison to the opportunity, is the current market capitalization of $2.74 billion. The $300 billion global market for luxury products is in the midst of a structural shift to online and Farfetch, with its network effects, is in prime position to benefit.\n\n\u201cTencent\u2019s deep technology expertise and ongoing relationship with Farfetch, paired with Dragoneer\u2019s expertise in supporting growth-oriented technology companies, makes both investors outstanding partners to support Farfetch\u2019s next chapter of growth,\u201d commented Farfetch founder and CEO Jos\u00e9 Neves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlant-based burger maker **Beyond Meat** $BYND dropped 15% this week as it emerged that the company is facing a lawsuit from former business partner Don Lee over claims the company misappropriated its trade secrets and broke a contract. \n\nDon Lee alleges that it helped Beyond develope the \u201cbeyond meat\u201d product using its own family secret while they were partners.  When Beyond Meat left the partnership, it allegedly took Don Lee\u2019s family secrets with and reportedly shared those secrets with other competitors in order to develop similar products.  The trial is to begin officially on May 18th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Grocery Outlet** $GO dropped 7% after reporting a secondary offering, even though it was non diluting, but this is a stock that is definitely worth a closer look.  The company has been called the TJ Maxx of grocery and its business model is very similar. It sells branded goods at discounts of 40%-70% by acting as a clearing channel for producers. That offers a treasure hunt experience for buyers and useful way to offload excess inventory for producers.\n\nI was initially sceptical of the ability to implement the model for grocery but the results speak for themselves. In November, the company reported strong Q3 earnings with revenues up 13.1%, comparable store sales up 5.8%, adjusted net income up 58.8% and adjusted EBITDA up 13.2%. Full year guidance was raised across the board with EPS rising from 69 cents to 73.5 cents at the midpoint (and comparable to 18 cents last year).\n\nIt is true that the company has to buy and sell certain staples such as bread and milk like any other grocery store. However it appears that there is a huge range of goods (dry goods, cereals, wines, deli, frozen etc) that lend themselves very well to the model. Opportunistic purchases of fresh produce such as meat, fruit and vegetables enhance the product range.\n\nThe two drivers for this business are;\n\n* There is a huge opportunity, Grocery Outlet currently has 330 locations but believes there is demand nationwide for 4,800 stores\n* Grocery Outlet (similar to TJ Maxx) is establishing itself as the go to market place for both producers and consumers. That leads to a virtuous circle of more high quality goods, more variety, more customers, more high quality goods.\n\nThe stock isn\u2019t cheap on 40x current year estimates but, given the size of the opportunity, the valuation appears very justifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, **Sorrento Therapeutics**' $SRNE board of directors unanimously rejected a proposal to acquire a majority or all of the company's shares for up to $7 per share (current $3.83). They concluded that the offer \"significantly undervalues the company and is not in the best interest of the shareholders.\"\n\nSorrento has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $763 million (after the recent increase).\n\nThe $7 bid follows two bids in December between $3-$5 which Sorrento immediately declined saying \u201cthe offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.\" The recent $7 bid suggests other parties may very well agree. Either way, management clearly think the company\u2019s value is well in excess of yesterdays close at $3.83 and, with all their insider knowledge, they probably know more than most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hepion Pharmaceuticals** $HEPA (WARNING SPECULATIVE NANO CAP)  jumped on Wednesday after positive findings from a Phase 1 expanded study\n\nHepion's drug candidate \"CRV431 offers a novel approach to the treatment of fibrosis caused by NASH and possibly other causes of liver injury,\" stated Dr. Robert Foster, CEO of Hepion Pharmaceuticals. \"This is because CRV431 acts, in part, by directly targeting fibrotic scar formation by down-regulating an important regulator of collagen synthesis, cyclophilin B, thereby reducing collagen production. This contrasts with most other NASH drug candidates that target events such as dyslipidemia or diabetes that may lead to fibrosis. Combining the direct antifibrotic actions of CRV431 with the indirect actions of other drug candidates likely represents the best opportunity for rapidly and effectively decreasing liver fibrosis in NASH.\"\n\nThe global Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) market is expected to cross US$20.0 Billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of more than 10.0% during given forecast period from 2018-2025.  Hepion has a long way to go before approval or commercialization of its drug and has since given back most of its gains.  However, with a market cap f just $18 million, even a small chance of developing a successful treatment for such a large prize makes this an interesting stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to receive updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",
