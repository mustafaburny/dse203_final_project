        "selftext": "Sup apes. In my first [DD last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhh7d/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in/), I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued, and how it should be in **everyone\u2019s portfolio**. With Part 2, I\u2019m addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021.  \n\n-\n\n\n**Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry?**\n-\nCorsair didn\u2019t snooze, but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire. Being well funded, profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche: Streaming. Have a look at their investor relations page:\n\n-\n\n*\u201cCorsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators. Our industry-leading gaming gear helps digital athletes, from casual gamers to committed professionals, to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms, and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio-quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans.* \n\n*CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato, which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, SCUF Gaming, which builds custom-designed controllers for competitive gamers, and **ORIGIN PC**, a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops.**\n\n-\nWith Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments (Streaming). While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops. **They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans, keyboards, RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play, stream or game properly.**\n\n**How much faster is Corsair really expanding?**\n-\n\nI cannot stress this enough, but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water. Seeing how they raised guidance, I think August will be even more brutal. One for value:\n\n* **$529.4 million** in net revenue, an increase of **71.6%** year-over-year. \n* **$175.9 million** net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment, an increase of **131.9%** year-over-year.\n* Gross profit was **$160.3 million**, an increase of **103.9%** year-over-year, with a gross margin of 30.3%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. \n* Operating income was **$67.3 million**, an increase of **404.5%** year-over-year.\n* Adjusted operating income was **$80.4 million**, an increase of **221.4%** year-over-year.\n\n\n-\nDo yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz, punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap. There\u2019s a reason why GME got picked up by DFV. Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term.\n\n-\n**Why hasn\u2019t it blown up yet to +100?**\n-\n\nThere is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation, the other is that there is very little retail investor interest, compared to the amount of net sellers. The second point actually holds up, the stock never really got picked up by retail investors (or apes) and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up, mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low. Pure but selfish value investing. \n\n-\n**Eagle What?**\n-\n\nThis one was also pointed out a lot. Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree. They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 (which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively) and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10% of the company. \n\nThey currently hold 61.9%. The shares sold are mostly picked up by **Vanguard**, **Blackrock** and a few other small institutions, plus retail of course. Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening **June 3rd 2021**. \n\nThis point doesn\u2019t concern me too much personally, as it\u2019s normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping $2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares. Now having sold their shares just now, it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months. \n\n-\n**Back to 2021 and how you can make money**\n-\n\nThey have a strong customer base which they've built up over the last 20 years, and thought f+ck it, let\u2019s go all in on this market. Tits and streaming? Amazing! Controllers for consoles? Let\u2019s do it. RGB Spinners on your lambo? Fuuckyea.\n\n-\n\nInstead of focusing on boring office peripherals that every Chinese company provides, they instead decided to slap RGB on everything and are loved for it. \n\n-\n\n**Now EagleTree is gonna continue doing what eagles do, and we will continue doing what apes do. I\u2019ll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter.**\n\n-\nI said it once, and I\u2019ll say it again. If you don\u2019t hold Corsair shares, you are pretty retarded. But since that\u2019s half the sub already, just do your wife\u2019s boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while they are still dirt cheap. He will thank you for it once they hit **$70** or even blow through the stratosphere with **+$100.**\n\n-\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nCorsair CEO Smart. Put this in your boomer dad\u2019s portfolio (shares) and If you like gambling, buy some calls. \n\n-\n\nPosition: 100 shares at $33 and 12x 40$ Nov Calls. (yes I\u2019m poor, and you can do better).",

I'd also like to point out that when gamestop ran like crazy, WallStreetBets gained over 8 million autists.  I don't think we are even seeing 100,000 new autists with this run.

We own 80% of AMC and it is shorted 20% that we know of (plenty more that we don't). 43% of BB is owned by institutions and shorted 10% that we know of. I think something is up.

I am back.\n\nYea I know you don't care who I am so let me just cut to the chase, I think we're going to see another massive GME run again very soon. Now I don't have any crazy DDs or upcoming secret catalysts to share but the way I trade stocks in general is mostly through Technical Analysis.\n\n*To keep this simple, if you're not familiar with Supply and Demand zones just think of them as \"support\" (Demand) and \"Resistance\" (Supply) for now...*\n\nOn the chart pictured below, it seems like GME tested weekly demand, went up a bit, then retested it again and as you see, buyers came in and bought it up once it touched demand again! I like how it respected the trend-line as well... I personally use demand zones to add on shares/contracts to my positions (which is what I did here)\n\n[GME 1D SUPPLY AND 1W DEMAND](https://preview.redd.it/s70d479sfp771.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40508e58a9f96133e0b0d9a52ec93f68bdd261b4)\n\n**If that didn't satisfy you enough...have no fear because I have more TA to show...**\n\nChart below is showing an apparent falling wedge on the daily and 4hr, not only did GME respect the wedge pattern, we also held the 38.2 fib support from the retracement back in march!:\n\n[GME Wedge and Fib-set](https://preview.redd.it/nq6uua1xdp771.png?width=1361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e109053530c5ce7a83df9d9b0e2ef83b687cc9)\n\nAnd my last example is more of just a slight theory but tell me if yall can also see this massive cup and handle showing on the daily/weekly or am I tripping?\n\n[GME C&amp;H?](https://preview.redd.it/51w2urn4fp771.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95da5e2848b87bf5dfe0528d97fdc55b3997f1f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TDLR: I think this is the GME bottom for awhile unless something crazy happens, if your gonna buy into GME, I recommend buying around here by demand and not being caught chasing when it squeezes again:/ \ud83d\ude80**\n\n*My positions: 8/20 250c + shares since last year*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, Happy trading!",

Only a handful of companies control the entire industry and that number is getting smaller and smaller.

Last week and today AMC has had a very good rally, but this is just the beginning, now let me tell you why. (I know finance can be dense and complicated so i'll try to keep it simple)\n\n# TLDR\n\n\\- There's a lot of options between 30 and 40 being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares causing a Gamma Squeeze today and after hours. If more large option volume is placed tomorrow between 40-50 the Gamma Squeeze will keep going. \n\n\\- Short holders will lose a lot of money as share price continues up, forcing them to buy more AMC to close their position sometime through the week. \n\n\\- \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\n\n# DD\n\nThe past few weeks have been great for meme stocks, but AMC is leading at the frontline of this rally outperforming the others like GME, BB, etc, boasting a 112% increase the past week. One of the reasons i've been able to hold confidence in, is AMC's option volume. A call is a promise to sell you 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. Behind this contract, are people called Market Makers. These are people sitting at Wallstreet, writing contracts for people to buy options if there is a lack of supply. Now let's look at the option chain for today expiring next week\n\n[Weekly call options from yahoo finance](https://preview.redd.it/4k3vjjb70r271.jpg?width=1327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0358dcc16a0a79ffbb1bbc292969a0c4f035494b)\n\nIf we look at the 3rd column from the right, that's the current volume of call options. Whenever people buy options, in order for market makers to minimize as much risk as possible, they buy stock in order to stay \"delta neutral\". Fancy phrase I know. A very basic explanation is that no matter where the stock moves, the market makers don't lose money. Their goal isn't to bet against you, their goal is to scalp the bid/ask margins. Now notice how the option volume is particularly high at 30, 35, and 40. As the price moves closer to these strike prices, market makers got to buy more shares in order to stay delta neutral. Now with this high volume, market makers need to buy **A LOT** more shares everytime the price goes up, which then snowballs larger and larger causing something called a \"Gamma squeeze\", which basically means STONK GO UP. Last week a similar phenomenon occured, now we can see it will especially rally up at the 30 (which it did), 35(which it did), and 40 mark (soon to come). Once we get closer to 40 hopefully tomorrow there will be more options being placed in order for the Gamma squeeze to continue, but until then we have the next phase.... the famous.... short squeeze...\n\nGamma squeeze is caused by an incrementation of options being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares to minimize their risk. Now that we've hit this point, the price has gone up a lot. Today alone AMC went up 40%. And. that. is. big. oh. no. to. short holders. Short holders are holding AMC to profit off of AMC to go down, luckily for us, these guys have not learnt their lesson! With AMC mooning from the Gamma squeezes, short holders will be hard red and and are **forced** to close out of their short position, requiring them to buy AMC driving the price up even further! This is what brought GME to it's peak of 400$/share. If we look at the short interest a month ago. \n\n[Last month short interest from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/2k2ey4k64r271.jpg?width=1180&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab47fb7e917b0fb861253378e6f95c613cf080a)\n\nWe can see here AMC was 20% shorted. Through the month short holders continued to close more and more causing AMC to go up and up. This drove the value higher and higher, and now AMC is busting 38$/share. Now notice that cute little tick at the bottom. \n\n[Two week ago short interest from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/a1uk4ca35r271.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8aee30112fd867588b91a90a2870ac60bf3bb619)\n\nWe can see here AMC short interest dropped to 16% but it looks like these short holders are doubling down and are increasing their short position. Today alone we busted 40% increase in AMC, if we can keep going we can make short holders force to close and climb even higher heights. 16-20% doesn't seem like much, but doing the math.... \n\nTotal shares in circulation = 448m ([taken from yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics/))\n\nFloat % = 18% (paid ortex subscription as shown above)\n\nShares shorted = 80.6million\n\n80.6 \\* 37$ (current AMC share value at the time of writing) = $2.983b\n\n.... needed to buy AMC. And that's before the AMC rocket takes off, it'll be even more while the rocket flies. So if any of you need any extra re-assurance, or a reason to put more money in, here ya go. If you guys want to continue the Gamma Squeeze, keep in mind the price needs momentum to carry up. Don't buy ridiculously far out call options like 70s or 80s because that won't give the stock an opportunity to climb up the 40s-60s range. It needs to be an incremental climb. \n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own research, and if you got any corrections for me please let me know! I'll edit my post or remove it completely if i missed/did something wrong\n\n# Reversal\n\nI'd be bs'ing you if i didn't say that this could go horribly wrong. The narrative i explained isn't **guaranteed to work**. In the case of bad news, or a large sell off, this can cause the price to fall or halt. Then the Gamma squeeze can't be sqoze which will then prevent the Short squeeze. Another point to keep in mind is we don't know **exactly** when the short holders will cover. They can double down and wait us out, but if we can keep the Gamma squeeze going, they'll have to close. To hold shorts you must pay a premium of [10%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) every year to hold onto the shorts. This fee can increase though, and it has been steadily increasing as the price continues to go up. Please don't bet more than you can lose in case of these events. As for me, i'm waking up at market open tomorrow and yolo'ing the rest of my 10k into more call options before the rocket blasts.  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11",

        "selftext": "After 2 weeks of AMC hype videos filling up my YT recommendation lists, countless online \"analysts\" completely bullish on the impending \"gamma squeeze\" that was all but assured to hit on Friday 6/18.... today passed with not much difference than any other day.\n\nIt honestly feels like we're playing poker at a high stakes table with the Hedge Funds with our cards facing up and looking around the room like we're secretly the smartest guy at the table.\n\nIs it time for us to truly snap back into reality and really look at what's going on here?  Let's be honest... the hedge funds have had weeks/months to learn from their GME mistakes.  Any call options that would have been out of the money today was probably already hedged against days/weeks ago.  Even if they let $40 and $50 OTM options expire today, they are probably recuperating their losses in profits elsewhere in their portfolio.  There may never come a situation where the AMC short squeeze will actually happen.  The gamma squeeze??  Well, that's already happened when it spiked from $10 to $72.  If that's not \"to the moon\", I'm not sure what is, especially for a stock that is 70% over-valued atm.\n\nI understand that this is a \"movement\" and that it's \"ape/retailers vs the big funds\" but I'm also seeing alot of people here yolo their entire savings onto a meme stock.  Am I the only one who thinks that we're doing a complete disservice to the amateur investors here who do not really know what they are doing and \\*actually\\* thinking they are making wise investments?\n\nAt the end of the day, there is no reality where the big hedge funds will just sit &amp; watch and roll-over while we squeeze AMC to $100+ and then tuck their tails between their legs and just swallow the losses without any strategic plan.  I think anyone who is still waiting and believing in this will be the ones left holding the bag.  The same people who held at $20 will be holding at $60, will still be holding even at $120 (if that ever comes) and one day, they will be left holding the bag regretting all of the chances they had to cash out for profit along the way.  Do these \"diamond hands\" actually have an exit plan?\n\nAs the old saying goes, it's not a loss until you sell.  But the inverse is also true.  It's never a gain if you hold forever either.  Am I missing something here or are we still all convinced that the hedge funds will stare down an oncoming semi-truck and just stand there like a deer in headlights while retailers rob them blind?  Something makes that very hard to believe....",

        "selftext": "Dear Apes, I'm writing to you today to tell you a few things. I see many people not understanding and wanting to. A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you crayon eaters.\n\nWelcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes. We are collectively we are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon eating apes whom are eager to eat some tasty banana's. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.\n\nThe main topic and example today is $CLOV. You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tendies (currency).\n\n$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?\n\nGood. Now, what causes the short squeeze? Truth is, many factors. WSB as a whole usually rallys around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and I'm turn causes the stock to go up. \n\nWhat is the perfect recipe? Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once. \n\nIs it too late to purchase $CLOV? No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those banana's back to us at the higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isnt as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually is a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan. \n\nWhat will the price hit? When do I sell? Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem if we just work together. The stonk market is a scary place, but we have the power in numbers.\n\nDid I miss out? Should I buy now? It's up to you, I'm not s financial advisor. Personally I'm doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.\n\nTo all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I'm telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.\n\nApes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best luck. \ud83c\udf40 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAMA \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f",

I spent a lot of time finding this information and I do think $WOOF is a good value play that is being HEAVILY shorted.  Also I'm not the other guy who posted about $WOOF earlier.**\n\n**So ,with that,**\n\n**From the degenerate behind** [**$TX - Latin America's Balls of Steel**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx74mo/tx_dd_ternium_it_up_latin_americas_balls_of_steel/)**, I introduce to you The $WOOF of Wallstreet - A Doggystyle DD.**\n\n# What is WOOF (PetCo)?\n\n[This is their building, its nice I guess.](https://preview.redd.it/wozz1n4269571.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b88457d937c3f0e0f705601b3299ca1216c001eb)\n\nSo now that half of America got all sad and pouty during COVID and bought themselves pandemic pets to cure that hole that permanently exists, pet goods are becoming more and more profitable. On top of this, most of you tards probably don\u2019t realize that just like people who have yearly physicals, your pets need to go to the vet. This is where the new Petco comes in.\n\nPetco defines itself as a \u201chealth and wellness company focused on improving the lives of pets, pet parents, and Petco partners\u201d. They sell various products including pet food, toys, health products, and live animals. Most importantly, they have started rapid expansion into veterinary services through their **Thrive &amp; Vital Care** brand**s**. I will bring this up later in the DD and highlight why it is extremely important as a case against popular competitor Chewy.\n\nPetco is also one of the only stores that actually takes a \u201cThink Adoption First\u201d philosophy. They have never sold dogs or cats and ended the sale of birds several years back. This adoption approach helps promote a more ethical way of bringing companions into people\u2019s lives.\n\n# Vets, Expansions, &amp; More:\n\nAlright, so you\u2019re probably wondering, why the fuck would I want to go into Petco when Chewy is already booming and has a unhealthy cult like following. Several reasons, all of which will make your wife's boyfriend let you watch them go doggystyle.\n\nPandemic pet business exploded, reaching a peak high near the end of 2020 in terms of ownership. \u2018Muricans were buying dogs, cats, hamsters, sex dolls, pocket pussies, and basically anything that could temporarily cure loneliness. In 2020, the pet industry posted a record $103.6 billion in sales, per the American Pet Products Association. However, this boom is not going aways anytime soon. Your pet isn\u2019t just going to disappear once you\u2019re back in the office, and no way in hell is Petco taking back that dog you just dressed up for fAmIlY pHoTos.\n\n[Recent discounts and shipment options](https://preview.redd.it/yngwxqxq69571.png?width=901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c73b477d92c6d7e8f5c4e0dfde8fc00c111732)\n\nThis means Petco is about to make **BANK** over the next two to three years solely on food and care supplies. By having physical stores, Petco is able to fulfill **83%** of its online orders through both store-shipment and curbside pickup. This has allowed for same day delivery as well, with many customers reporting deliveries within 3-4 hours.\n\nMany pet owners also prefer getting fresh food, which is much more expensive for Chewy to ship from distribution centers. Petco gets to avoid extra packaging and costs by shipping directly from local stores that keep products en bulk.\n\nTheir CEO, Ron Coughlin, states \u201cGiving a personal example, when my order of Just Food for Dogs, fish and sweet potatoes comes from one of our Pet Care Centers two miles from my house, it comes in a simple bag versus a pack box with cardboard with dry ice with foam packaging that online pure-play competitors use for comparable products,\u201d said Mr. Coughlin. \u201cClearly, we have an advantage here.\u201d\n\nOn top of training and grooming services in stores, Petco is overwhelmed by the demand for these services as their CEO reports 11 million new pet adoptions in the past year. In general, pets are considered a **recession-proof** industry since they need to be fed and kept healthy regardless of economic conditions (to some extent).\n\n[ \\\\\"Hahaha we're about to take away your balls dude\\\\\" \\~ Petco Vet Center ](https://preview.redd.it/r7dqe27379571.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4701682e5849ee599ad3466a001e1c4c1fac4d89)\n\n**Vet Business:** The Petco brand Vital Care is their main veterinary business and added nearly **70,000** new members since its launch in October, with each of these customers spending **2.5x more than the average customer.** Overall, these services grew **63% year over year** with another 40% increase over the next year. All of these signs point towards a strengthening business model that competes in a space, other companies like PetSmart and Chewy have not expanded into.\n\n**Petco\u2019s Vital Care** offers an annual plan that includes vet services and grooming discounts, for $19/m. This comes out to about $228 a year. On average, appointments, pet insurance, and other emergencies raise traditional vet costs into the thousands. Petco\u2019s plans show that even as a poor, you can continue to live with your 12 cats without going broke. **They also just opened their 100th in-store veterinary hospital with no signs of stopping expansion.**\n\nThere have also been reports of some PetCo stores being **renovated** due the the company\u2019s rebranding as a pet health and wellness store. **The reason I find this very bullish is that only a company expecting future growth and having the funds to do so would invest in large renovation projects.**\n\n**Essentially, Petco has transformed itself to become a one stop shop for pet supplies, grooming, training, and vet health services, all while providing a digital platform to access these services. This business model beats nearly every other pet company out there right now.**\n\nThis serves **extremely well for both short and long term investors** looking for a possible run-up in the next few weeks and those seeking to capture large gains across several months.\n\n# The S.H.A.R.T Play:\n\n[Self Explanatory](https://preview.redd.it/cvjizmj679571.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76a63b0e33b4bf8ea6f659cba15ce15e0455cc86)\n\n**This is what S.H.A.R.T stands for:**\n\nS - Short Interest\n\nH - Hype\n\nA - Availability (Demand)\n\nR - Really Memeable\n\nT - Timing\n\n# Shart Interest:\n\n[SHART INTEREST @ 36&amp;#37; 6th Most Shorted Stock](https://preview.redd.it/se8qmn2u69571.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41b575fb9e21966c8655e4688e2e57d6478bda53)\n\nSeveral different sources are reporting different shart interest numbers on $WOOF, ranging from 9% to 100%. Ideally, I want to go with the 100% shart rate, but I think it is around 36% since this is a fucking Bloomberg Terminal lol. The float is low as well at around 16M.\n\n**Therefore, shart interest is around 36% which is still significantly high.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hype:**\n\nWe can see that $WOOF already gained traction once before and continues to do so. There are some reddit whales who have already bought into $WOOF this past week as well. IV is moderately high across the options chain, hovering between 60-80%, indicating that right now is still an okay time to buy in if this DD is convincing you of Petco's potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Availability:**\n\nWhen I say availability, it is meant to measure the demand of the goods and services provided by said company. In the case of Petco, I see demand sustaining throughout 2021 and into 2022, because as mentioned before, pets aren\u2019t going anywhere. If Petco is able to capitalize on this by continuing to bring better service features and different vet plans, it could target niche pet markets such as salon care as well for more wealthy clients. Currently, demand is severely outpacing the availability of their services, and as a result, I believe they will have very strong earnings again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Really Memeable:**\n\nI think this one is self explanatory. Petco memed itself because\n\na) It IPOd right when GME gaped up everyone\u2019s mom\u2019s buttholes\n\nb) Its ticker is a fucking sound. It\u2019s not even a real word lol.\n\nWith WSB already having some knowledge of this ticker and the fundamentals indicating it is a good value play for the year, I have full confidence in this trade regardless of it being memed or not even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Timing:**\n\nSomewhat covered in the previous points, but this is the perfect entry point. Looking at the price graph over the past 6 months, even after beating the estimated Q1 EPS of $0.09 by nearly 100% (Actual EPS of $0.17), the stock has continued to trade sideways for a majority of the year. You could have bought in February and made $0 to date. For this reason, I think the timing for the play is great. \n\n# Financials:\n\nAs mentioned earlier the predicted EPS for Q1 of 2021 was $0.09 while the actual EPS ended up being $0.17, a **89% beat**. Meanwhile, the stock tanked lower and has stayed bound between the $20 and $24 range for 5 months.\n\nWithin this quarter alone, Petco got an additional **1.2 million customers and 28% increase in YoY sales.** Through DoorDash, they are able to increase expected revenue up to **$5.58B** by continuously providing same day shipping. (I find this partnership a bit sketchy just because of how overvalued and trash DoorDash is).\n\nRegarding its competitor $CHEWY, we can see that it leads with a forward P/E of nearly 245 while Petco is \u201conly\u201d at 29. Although this is relatively high, within its sector, Petco is trading at a massive discount. Petco is able to target those who want an in-store experience or simply cheaper services, but also caters to the online crowd in an easy to manage fashion. The same cannot be said for Chewy. Chewy did expand into telehealth services but so far, these do not replace a traditional vet appointment.\n\nIn terms of debt, $WOOF just payed off nearly **$1.7B of debt, and is left with just $1.8B**, all due to the IPO funds they secured. With a much more positive balance sheet, I find this to be another reason that right now is a the right time to enter Petco.\n\n# Given all of this data, future growth, and the expansion of Petco as much more than a pet supply store, it makes zero sense for this stock to have a 36% short interest rate or trade sideways for so long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analyst ANALysis:\n\nAs of last week, Citi brought back a **Buy rating** on $WOOF with a price target of $31, indicating **upside of nearly 30%** from its current price point of $23.80. Bank of America jumped on this as well (lol), and is giving it a new Buy rating with **increased EBITDA forecasts through 2023.**\n\nOn Nasdaq\u2019s overview, based on 3 analysts, **$WOOF is a strong buy with a PT of $29.40. Although ANALysts can be quite wrong, the signs of it being a strong buy are evident across many firms, making this seem like an even better play.**\n\n# \ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Case:\n\nI think the main issues Petco faces is its customer service issues. From accounts I\u2019ve read on grooming and vet experiences, people either have an extremely good appointment or a very bad one. Petco needs to fix this by bringing consistency in training across their stores before expanding too much and getting overwhelmed by growth without accounting for quality.\n\nI also think that with the lockup period expiring around Mid-July (180 days after Jan 14th), there could be a small dip if the price runs up in the next few weeks.\n\nOne final thing I thought of is if Chewy manages to utilize a healthcare company\u2019s coaching and vet networks to tie into its telehealth services. This is the biggest competitive move they could make as they would only be paying for a network plan as a single client and simply offset the costs across all of their customers. Additionally, many of the networks provided by big names like United Healthcare are multinational and include thousands of providers. This would allow Chewy to give cheaper vet access to all of its customers in almost any location, unlike Petco which is still in the expansion process in its limited stores.\n\n# Conclusion / TL;DR:\n\nDespite the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b case above, **I strongly believe that $WOOF is a very undervalued company with strong financials that get better each day. Combining the 36% shart interest, lower share value, and high PTs, I am convinced that $WOOF is a great play. If you want your wife to let you do it doggystyle, then $WOOF is the perfect play to make money and get turnt.**\n\n**I am in already for 5 contracts of 9/17 30Cs and will continue to add to my position this week. I may also play FDs in case this gains traction this week.**\n\nPlease make trades responsibly and with your own understanding of the stock as I\u2019m not responsible for you being retarded or complaining that this is P&amp;D!",

Experts are already stating that this salad is the salad of the summer. See attached citation for review.  ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Second,** Wendys social media profile is no stranger to memes. Everyone has seen the \"Roast Me\" thing that Wendys has been doing. Well this will only increase with fellow autists supporting it. Academics have called this term \"metapragmatic roasting\" and its incredibly effective with the younger generation. Here is a chart demonstrating the breakdown of their tweets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S0378216620301120#fig3](https://preview.redd.it/loppdub5mu371.png?width=357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8c5b8485a2ab060d6c7f2a8585230fbd11dd707)\n\nHere is another article from business daily demonstrating the effectiveness of Wendys perceived social media presence. [https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2018/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef](https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2018/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Third**, Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in this Social Media \"Beef\" or \"Metapragmatic Roasting\" of each other. Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts. See the below image for an example. ([https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en](https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Coincidence? ](https://preview.redd.it/zug6vms5nu371.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2144efe81af5d11abfd7702386aa5301defef822)\n\n**Forth, well this one is obvious but Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo lets talk technical. Supposedly $WEN (Wendy's) has a low public float of around 17 million shares. It has between a 4-10$ float which will increase as the stock increases because fast food retail is a relatively predictable stock (Same reason why Utility Companies will get shorted to shit when they rise look at $NEE earlier this year).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith an average volume of around 1 Million per day there is a huge amount of Alpha to be had in investing in Wendys. Right now the Implied Volatility on options is tiny (29-34%) which means that you can get a position for pennies on the dollar. Further, buying shares is small as well as its currently not a volatile company. Either way its a good investment because of the Salad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm in at $22.97 and calls expiring on January of next year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock, and Wendys.",

        "selftext": "There are many stocks being discussed right now and I thought I would share some of my observations of the trends of these stocks. Trends are obviously not always reliable, but they do give us some idea as to what is happening and what may happen in the near future. Timing is key to everything. This is not to say these are bad stocks. All stocks have ups and downs.  \n\nThis is not professional or financial advice. These are just my personal observations. \n\n#**Some technical terminology:**\n\n**Bullish** = share prices rising\n\n**Bearish** = share prices falling\n\n**1. Exponential moving average (EMA)**\n\n*What is what in the chart of share prices*:\n\n* **Purple** line is EMA over past 20 blocks (EMA 20) - this shows a tighter trend since it averages over a shorter amount of time\n* **Light blue** line is EMA over past 50 blocks (EMA 50)\n* **Green line** is EMA over past 200 blocks (EMA 200) - this shows a more general trend since it averages over a longer amount of time\n\n*Significance*:\n\n* **Purple (EMA 20)** above **blue (EMA 50)** which is above **green (EMA 200)** = bullish\n* stock crossing or bouncing off an EMA line in UPwards direction = bullish\n* stock crossing or bouncing off an EMA line in DOWNwards direction = bearish\n* EMA lines can be good references for support and resistance. \n\n\n**2. Trading volume**\n\nThese are the vertical bars lined up below the stock chart\n\n* taller bar = higher trading volume (this is good for generating momentum)\n\n\n**3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)**\n\nThis is the middle graph consisting below the main chart consisting of a blue squiggly line. It signifies price momentum. \n\nBasically:\n\n* closer to the top bar = stock is more overbought\n* closer to the bottom bar = stock is more oversold\n\n**4. Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)**\nThis is the bottom most graph consisting of green bars, red bars, and 2 interweaving lines of blue and orange. This graph also signifies momentum. The two interweaving lines show the relationship between two moving averages of a share price\n\nBasically:\n\n* orange line ABOVE the blue line = bullish momentum\n* orange line UNDER the blue line = bearish momentum\n\n\n#**Now applying these concepts to the following stocks:**\n\n\n#**SENS**\nIncreased 29.3% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 27%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/85Rs2Tz3/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-22-29-AM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively *very high* trading volume\n3. RSI is not above the top bar indicating oversold, which is great given the dramatic rise over the past several days\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**\n\nI drew a horizontal line at around 4.2. This has been a point of resistance a couple times in the past few days but the broke above it Friday and seems to have converted it into a point of support. This appears bullish.\n\n#**CLF** \nIncreased 23.9% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 33%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/ZYLCjYgv/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-23-54-AM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively high trading volume = good for momentum\n3. There is momentum on the RSI towards selling but it is not above the top bar indicating being way oversold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is over the blue line (*bullish*)\n\nI drew a horizontal golden line around 24.5 which was previously a point of resistance where the stock was rejected twice. On Friday, it looks like the stock had bullish momentum back to that line and may be able to consolidate and convert that line from resistance to support. \n\n#**Vinco ventures**\nIncreased 13.5% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 23%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/zvq354Lf/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-23-18-AM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in bullish order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively high trading volume\n3. RSI is in the middle meaning not oversold, which is good given the recent uptrend\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is right on the blue line\n\nI drew a horizontal golden line around 4.7 which has been a point of resistance x2, then support, then resistance. It appears the stock just broke above the line which is bullish.\n\n#**CLNE**\nIncreased 4.0% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 24%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/pLS980S0/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-24-48-AM.png)\n\n1. It looks like the stock and purple EMA line (EMA 20) is crossing the green EMA line (EMA 200). This suggests bearish movement.\n2. Trading volume is less than previously in the week, seems to be about its normal amount before the hype started.\n3. RSI is closer to the lower bar, suggesting it may be somewhat undersold. \n4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, no upward or downward. \n\nI drew a horizontal line golden line around 11.1 which was initially a point of support and now appears to be a point of resistance. This is not convincingly bullish.\n\n#**CLOV**\nIncreased 58.8% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio\t24%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/Gmt840X8/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-02-AM.png)\n\n1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This is hard to determine since it has not crossed, but does not suggest bullish movement. \n2. Trading volume is still relatively higher than normal\n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, hard to interpret. \n\nI drew a horizontal golden line around 16. This has been a line of support in the past few days, but now seems to be a point of resistance since the stock is now below it. This is not convincingly bullish.\n\n#**TLRY**\nIncreased 4.27% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 29%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/FzGzKGcV/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-17-AM.png)\n\n1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This does not suggest bullish movement. Hard to determine since it is not crossed.\n2. Trading volume on Friday about the same as earlier in the week \n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.\n\nIt appears a critical point is around 19.8 (defined by the green EMA 200 line!). This was previously support the previous day but has become a point of resistance on Friday. If it can break past this upwards, that could suggest upwards movement. \n\n#**WKHS**\nIncreased 12.27% in past 5 days\n\nShort volume: 22%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/qRVzDN4y/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-22-AM.png)\n\n1. The purple EMA 20 line is below the light blue EMA 50 line, which is somewhat unfavorable. However, both are still above the green EMA 200 line.\n2. Trading volume is low\n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.\n\nIt looks like there is currently support right at the purple EMA 20 line around 15.4. I drew a horizontal golden line at 16.2 which has been a point of resistance. If the stock can break above that, that would indicate bullish momentum to me. \n\n#**WEN**\nIncreased 5.09% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 14%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/TPWKcVMT/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-30-AM.png)\n\n1. The stock, the purple EMA 20 line, and the light blue EMA 50 line are all below the green EMA 200 line. Bearish.\n2. Trading volume is low\n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.\n\nI drew a horizontal golden line at around 24.5. This is a point that the stock would need to break above.\n\n#**WISH**\nIncreased 30.38% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 30%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/mZ3FqycD/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-21-36-AM.png)\n\n1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This does not suggest bullish movement. \n2. trading volume is okay\n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, momentum can go up or down. \n\n\ntl:dr: SENS, CLF, look promising. WKHS, WISH, CLOV, TLRY, CLNE, WEN do not look quite as promising. Again, these only give us a sense of the momentum and are very very short term. Momentum can change in one day. Come Monday, momentums can change. Again, I am not a professional or financial advisor. These are my personal observations.\n\n\n\n#**EDIT:** Added these per people's request\n#**FUBO**\n\nIncreased 7.04% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 17%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/XJFhb7mw/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-24-16-PM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively high trading volume\n3. RSI is high, may come back down\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**\n\nIt looks like it broke through its point of resistance -- suggests bullish\n\n#**UWMC**\n\nIncreased 15.35% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 31%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/QNQPYCpD/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-24-41-PM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively high trading volume\n3. RSI is in middle\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**\n\nIt looks like it broke through its point of resistance -- suggests bullish\n\n*edited: EMA = exponential moving average and RSI directionality, thanks folks. Probably should have proofread better. \n\nAnother comment: \nI know some don't think technicals apply to \"meme stocks\". However, I think they do still apply to \"meme stocks\" and give a better understanding of the current momentum and short term trends. I would not personally buy shares of a stock without considering its current momentum, past performance, and trends. We all know to \"buy the dip\", but these analyses can better inform us on what level of a dip would be a good buy. These analyses are how day traders decide their entry and exit points. I think a lot of traders would agree that technicals certainly apply to \"meme stocks\" and they use these to profit from the volatility and trade volume of these stocks. I agree that technical analysis is less applicable for the long term. Again, all stocks, even the best stocks, have their ups and downs. Again these are all very very short term predictions. Things can certainly change within a day. Come Monday, any of these can start to look more bullish or bearish. One thing you can do for your own confirmation is look back over the last few weeks of one of these stocks and look at the EMAs, RSI, and MACD and see how it correlates with the way the stock moves. Or you're welcome to look elsewhere on the internet because many people are doing technical analyses for these stocks. There are plenty on youtube. I'm certainly not a professional trader, but I like to be objective and I thought it would be nice to provide some objective data and analyses in this subreddit. A big reason GME was successful in January was because of the objective data and analyses put into it. I do love the hype and enthusiasm, but at the end of the day we should be making informed decisions for our money that are based on objective reasons--not just subjectively based on how many posts or comments mention a certain stock. Obviously feel free to disregard if you think technical analyses are irrelevant. And thanks for the corrections! Best of luck to all!",

        "selftext": "I'd really like to have a discussion here about GME. Everytime it seems I see anyone suggest it as a viable investment, it gets downvoted to oblivion. I hear some of the same arguments against its volatility but exposure to volatility is ok in a balanced portfolio, you dont need to be strictly ETF's. Know your limit, play within it, when it comes to speculative investments. Another argument is that its a dead business, that is far from the fact imo. It was on a downward path and would have gone the way of blockbuster but at this point, I see it as more of a Netflix. It is a debt free company, great new management team, proven to care about investors and care about the quality of service that customers receive. The fact it's been labelled a \"meme\" stock is insulting at this point, it's not a \"meme\" company with a bunch of \"meme\" employees. It's a company transitioning from its antiquated business model into a hopefully ecommerce powerhouse with at this point a global brand. The craze around this stock has made GME more of a household name then it has ever been. \nI'd love to have a good constructive discussion about it and see what exactly it is that makes some people so bearish on this and maybe we can take it a little more seriously then the label it's been given by CNBC and other MSM.",

        "selftext": "I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I\u2019m not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what\u2019s going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).\n\n**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**\n\n**What Is Clover Health?**\n\nClover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient\u2019s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. \n\nCurrently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company\u2019s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.\n\n[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &amp;#37; of growth compared to competitors \\(cloverhealth.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)\n\nCLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.\n\n**Positive Catalysts**\n\nAll the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I\u2019m keeping an eye on: \n\n* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they\u2019ll pay a fine and that\u2019ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it\u2019s related to Medicare. \n* Biden\u2019s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.\n* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.\n* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They\u2019re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.\n\n**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**\n\n* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it\u2019s unclear when it will be settled. Although it\u2019s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.\n* Hindenturd\u2019s constant attacks despite insisting they don\u2019t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren\u2019t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg\u2019s report was created to hurt all of Chamath\u2019s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I\u2019ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)\n* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you\u2019ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.\n\n**Let\u2019s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**\n\nCLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it\u2019s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it\u2019s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it\u2019s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won\u2019t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.\n\n[CLOV S\\/I&amp;#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)\n\nNo need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren\u2019t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won\u2019t be any dilution.\n\nThe P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let\u2019s talk about CLOV\u2019s P/S ratio for a moment. \n\nCLOV\u2019s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV\u2019s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I\u2019m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers\u2019 manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren\u2019t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they\u2019ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they\u2019ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there\u2019s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.\n\nCLOV\u2019s Response to Hindenburg Allegations: [https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research/17921324.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research/17921324.html)",

Your favourite fruit is back for some sweet DD ($CRSR) that will catapult your shitty portfolio into the stratosphere. \n  \n\n\n  Ever heard of Corsair?\n-\nThey are the boys that fill your neat gaming PC full of dope parts. Not only are they a giant in this industry since their inception in 1994, they also got publicly listed last October for a measly **$15.**\n\n-\n\nNow, why should you care?\n-\n\nCorsair has all the properties that can make it THE stock of the decade for WSB - think AMD before they went from $4 to $80, now this time it's from $30 to $300.\n\n-\n\n**1.DeepF#ckingValue**\n-\n\nTheir current market cap stands at **3.12B** on **1.92B sales** and **148m profit.** That\u2019s insane in itself, their current market cap is minuscule and should be at least 5x their revenue. They are making cash hand over fist every quarter and are already a crazy growth rocket. \n\n\n \n\n-\nAs per recent earnings article: *\u201cMajor industry tailwinds seem to be helping Corsair achieve strong growth rates. In the first quarter, its overall revenue grew 72% year over year to $529 million. The company also continues to see improved profitability, as gross margin jumped from 25.5% a year ago to 30.3%.\u201d*\n\n\n-\n**2.Tiny float**\n-\n\nThey IPO\u2019d with only 91.95 million shares outstanding and a float of 88.4 million. This entire sub could outright buy the company out. Jokes aside, this isn't moving a 500m share giant like NOKIA, but rather like your beer filled kiddiepool.\n**3.Cheap Options**\n-\nFlat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.\n\n**4.Low Risk** \n-\nAlways arguable, but This company just IPOed, is healthy and makes tons of cash. No risk of bankruptcy looming around the corner, or shares being diluted if it his 50$ or 100$. YOU CAN SAFELY PARK YOUR YOLO'd CASH without the company blowing up any second.\n\n**What else?**\n\nAnalysts on SA have a big raging one for CRSR. (link in comments) and there is a very possible breakout about to happen + earnings coming up in August.\n\n\n\nNow what company fits better for millions of Gamestop apes? A Gaming company that will fill every GameStop with little ram sticks and gaming gear. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n**TL:DR** $CRSR is a good bet that could safely triple your money... Or blow your brains out with 3-6 months calls.\n\nObligatory: I LIKE THE STOCK.

        "selftext": "PLTR has come up in this subreddit a lot in the past and people have been burned on it as well. I've lost thousands on PLTR but i'm still holding because the company is beyond incredible. One of the biggest questions i've seen that nobody truly understands is \"What is Palantir? What do they do?\", so let me attempt to explain wtf they do... Precursor, this isn't an in-depth analyses of PLTR fundamentals and financials. If you want to look at their fundamentals you can check some other dd like this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9ydod/palantirs_pltr_fundamentals_just_became_even/). It's about a month old, but it's still incredibly relevant now. This post is meant to address the general question of what PLTR is as a company, what they do, and bring some general attention to the interesting options volume this week.\n\n*This is not financial advice. Do your own research!!! The more research i did in PLTR the more bullish i became.*\n\n# TL;DR\n\n\\- PLTR visualizes abstract data in a meaningful way for any business to easily analyze and efficiently run their business.\n\n\\- PLTR is a modular system that allows for companies to connect with each other seemlessly creating an interconnected community for data to travel which will create waves in how business is conducted.\n\n\\- PLTR is an engineering master piece that is incredibly unique. For anyone to compete with them will be difficult to put it lightly.\n\n\\- PLTR has been sleeping for a while, it's ready for a rally if we can get enough attention due to high Open Interest and low IV.\n\n\\- [Karp is a Giga Chad](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQwLx-qpgHrcSU27NjPrIq6LBMCkjMG6HIfjZCcVKRmhQmlyNwx)\n\n# What is Palantir?\n\n\"Palantir is a platform for data analytics and ai\", I've seen this thrown around quite a bit, and honestly wtf does that mean? I'm a programmer and even i don't fucking get it. Well all became clear after the [demo day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFP3sBQfaww) came out, where finally PLTR showcased their platforms which people are sleepin on. Before we can answer what PLTR is, we need to answer \"what is data\"? Data is the logical representation of the real world. Any largescale business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). So what does PLTR do with this data? Well they consolidate a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible easily digestible UI for the company to use. (Note that they take company's data, PLTR doesn't gather or store any data of it's own) Easy right? This allows for pretty much any company/organization like [the CDC for medicine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-to-help-u-s-track-covid-19-vaccines-11603367276), the [military for national security](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/21-launch/), and the [stock market for financial fraud](https://twitter.com/PalantirTech/status/1399747624463486986) (stock market is only rumors for now but hopefully PLTR HELP US FIND THE HEDGIES THAT MANIPULATE THE MARKET) . But how insane is this? Working with that much data is a nightmare. In a society where data is already a necessity, being able to look through and analyze data quickly for any anomalies or patterns is crucial to any company and is often overwhelming. With PLTR a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that PLTR detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, PLTR had a huge hand in this. PLTR gives visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that has risen if any, allowing for fast response time. You can imagine PLTR displaying a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator can click 1 of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where are things going, what kind of picture does the data represent, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. Now this is just an example, PLTR is general enough and customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure. Once data is organized it opens up the possibility for even further opportunities such as creating simulations of potential issues that can happen in order to forsee and plan for various situations. It allows data to be clean enough to train machine learning algorithms (a big problem with ML is that data isn't clean or has weird edge cases that fucks up the model. If you talk to any data/ml engineer they will typically mention most of their job is cleaning data over actual application). Companies can create scripts or AI to respond to events if needed. It can be as simple as notifying an executive if an issue occurs, or completely issuing a rollback order if there's a sudden spike of side effects for the covid vaccine which will be represented in the data. It's the ultimate data representation/analysis platform that any company can utilize and it's fucking insane, i still casn't believe PLTR managed to do this. But it brings up a few problems.\n\n# Why Palantir?\n\nWhy can't companies just create their own platform? Because it's expensive, time consuming, and complicated. A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Take the automotive industry for example and self driving. Driving data needs to be collected and stored for AI. That's a lot of data... like pentabytes of data if not more.... Now let's say there's data being collected in America, the signs and the messages on side walks, are different than those that are in the UK. If you have a dataset from the UK well that data comes with it's own issues and rules, this creates a problem called \"data silos\" meaning data is separated into it's own little circle separated from other data silos. If the company decides to make a platform to analyze these 2 different types of data, they will have to consolidate, organize, and create 2 kinds of platforms for it. Now this example is only 2, large businesses have dozens of data silos that are often abandoned or isolated. PLTR is a generalized platform that encompasses any and all kinds of data which they themselves work closely with companies in order to cater to what they need. Why can't companies create a general platform themselves? Because it's an engineering nightmare and PLTR is an engineering masterpiece.... It is so insanely difficult to create something general enough to fit any and all data... but PLTR has done exactly that. The best comparison i can correlate this to is computers. Before generalized computers, computers would be built and deployed to do 1 job and 1 job only. Once generalized computers came out it's used everywhere and no company develops their own computer for a single job, they go out and buy a computer, in this case, any company that manages data can benefit from PLTR.\n\nAnother benefit we see from PLTR is that PLTR is 1 huge modular system. If a person from 1 company wants to share data with another company that utilizes PLTR they can do so seemlessly. PLTR talks with each other and easily sends data to and from. Imagine if hospitals or universities adapted this system. You no longer have to manually print a transcript and submit it to the other university's administration and then wait for it to be processed for a few days. If your medical records are stored in 1 hospital and you get sent to the ER in another hospital, your main hospital can send your medical records to the ER you're at seemlessly and quickly. Its insane how misunderstood PLTR is, but it's a far reaching company that will dig into the roots of all whether you jump into it or not, all i'm doing is trying to have it move sooner than later. Deep roots are not reached by the forst.\n\nKarp is a giga chad. Fucking guy got the intelligence of Elon Musk if not more, and the hair to fucking prove it. If you want to witness it first hand, listen to some of his[interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjjHdys2Ph4). A lot of his philosophies are amazing and I believe in his abilities to make PLTR go to the moon. \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\n\nIf anyone's worried that the military may drop PLTR, [here ya go](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/).\n\n# Why now?\n\nI did a DD on AMC a week ago calling the rally from $20 -&gt; $70. Will the same happen with PLTR? **It can** but it'll need some help. Not gonna explain how the squeeze works as it's beyond the scope of this post. If you want check out the [DD i did on AMC](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqa5x8/why_amc_is_rallying_and_why_it_will_continue/), i explain the idea there.\n\n[PLTR Option Chain from Yahoo Finance](https://preview.redd.it/e10egiyiac571.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db92a97940da7189c65e524fe3e6595c70eb638e)\n\nfucking options volume is even higher than AMC when i did AMC's DD. Now PLTR has a larger market cap than AMC so we probably won't see a run up as large as AMC but it's still a great stock with great opportunity. If we can get enough people to get on PLTR it can definitely pop. The options volume is spread out very nicely through the 20-30 range which is perfect for launching the price forward. Meme stocks typically has a second coming. GME had a 2nd wind, BB had a 2nd wind, AMC's 2nd wind is nuttier than it's first one ffs, it looks like it's about time for PLTR to have it's 2nd wind, but it needs more attention.\n\n# Why not AMC/GME/BB/etc?\n\n**I love memes and have made a lot of money off memes.** As much as I love AMC and GME, I sold at the top. I sold AMC at 70, and i sold GME at 400. Why? **Because Meme stocks need to cool down**. This isn't because of hedgies or any kind of attacks. Stocks that are very volatile causes their options to be ridiculously expensive, which prevents the potential for a rally from happening because it's much harder for people to buy in options. Ultimately I don't want to be a bag holder, and i don't want others to be bag holding (rip GME 400$ holders and AMC 70$ holders). Everyone should look for selling opportunities, for GME it was RH closing down and AMC was when the rally ran it's course. (Check the AMC DD above if you need proof, i updated the post as soon as i sold at $70. GME unfortunately I have no proof for) I will still look for opportunities to buy into GME/AMC again once it's cooled down a bit but for now, PLTR is really cheap, volatility is really low, and we're sitting at the floor right now with huge potential for it to explode. People have been burnt before when PLTR was cooling off from the past, but now **the second coming is near....** We're at the floor right now so if the narrative doesn't play out it's also just a great stock to hold.\n\n# Reversal/Exit\n\nUnfortunately PLTR doesn't have the same attention as AMC did when i wrote the last DD, so in order for it to pop off this week PLTR will need some love. Even if not enough people realizes how amazing it actually is then it'll just sit steady and grow over time. For PLTR i don't really have an exit. If it does rally i will sell and let it cool, but i'll update this post if that happens. If that doesn't ever happen, then i'll just keep PLTR as a long term hold, and re-allocate funds to riskier plays based on my risk tolerance and when opportunity arises. Other than that I'm more than happy to hold PLTR for years to come. PLTR already has pretty much everything i own right now... All my money, my commitment, my wife... o\\_o PLTR is my wife's boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Position**:\n\n4250 shares at $23.32\n\n40x $27 calls 7/9\n\n10x $30 calls 7/9\n\n(I do think PLTR will moon sooner, sometime within the week with enough attention but I don't want to get dicked by Theta so i bought calls a bit further out. I plan on buying weeklies tomorrow morning for the big dick yolo)\n\n47x $30 calls 1/21/22 (the long term hold)",

Has nice DDs.\n* New [Big Dick CEO](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/) starts *today*. He's literally led a company to Mars. Before that he was the overlord of tendies dipping sauces at Heinz.\n* Priced at a discount to its peers, with significant Q2 and Q3 upside potential.\n* Passes [the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/): 2nd highest SI of dividend stocks (BBBY is #1), low liquidity, low IV.\n* It cums with the meme stocks. Basically like BBBY but IV = 40% instead of 110%.\n* Sloppy seconds short squeeze potential: 1) growth-to-value rotation *or* 2) meme stocks squeeze again.\n* Runs [a brothel](https://bgfoods.com/brands/): Green Giant, Skinny Girl, Mama Mary's, Crisco, Cream of Wheat, etc.\n* This is not financial advice and don't buy shit if the IV is through the roof.\n\n# Preface\n\nThis post comes to you after after discovering [the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/) which lead to WWE opening her legs at +10%, climaxing at +25%, and cuddling to +11% at close.  All this on a day with zero news, except my one [moderately successful WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcyxf/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/).\n\nWWE's IV of 35% implied a 2.2% stddev in daily price change... so an 11% close represents a 5 sigma event. My take is that WWE got pregnant after getting fucked by WSB wearing *five* condoms. I think MMs got defensive by pumping up the ask and IVs during PM, possibly due to seeing sentiment pop. (Unfortunately, it didn't take WWE long to start showing pregnancy sickness -- she regurgitated some gains in the last couple of days.)\n\nWWE definitely came, and so did I. My FDs were up 2500%, and Jan LEAPs up 250%. However, in an act of sheer horniness after spending all day furiously writing the DD, I had posted it after close. So only those able to get in at open were able to appreciate the climax. **I'm not making that mistake this time.**\n\n## My point is: if you're looking for a broad who is so fertile that even a modest amount of WSB autist-sperm can knock her up a few points, then go for a SMELLy broad... they get knocked up easily.\n\nIn this case, I'm going gay and hoping BGS's [Green Giant](https://bgfoods.com/brands/green-giant) shows us more of his giant green cock. The fun doesn't stop there.. he'll bring along [Ass-Clapper Girl](https://bgfoods.com/brands/clabber-girl/), some [anorexic bitch](https://bgfoods.com/brands/skinnygirl-dressings/), a [certified MILF](https://bgfoods.com/brands/mama-marys/), and hell, even [Grandma](https://bgfoods.com/brands/grandmas/)! They'll even bring some [Crisco](https://bgfoods.com/brands/crisco/) \\-- anything to make you [cream](https://bgfoods.com/brands/cream-of-wheat/) or have a [perfect release](https://bgfoods.com/brands/bakers-joy/). If the thrill of evading the law is more your thing, they can bring along [some](https://bgfoods.com/brands/ortega/) [illegal](https://bgfoods.com/brands/buena-vida/) [immigrants](https://bgfoods.com/brands/las-palmas/), too.\n\nThe Aristocrats aside, BGS's **S**hort interest, **M**arket cap, **L**ow IV, and **L**iquidity make it one SMELLy bitch. As for **F**undamentals, I think they're solid. She's got a good heart, but who the fuck cares about that when she's got lovely DDs? Besides, \"f\" can't be jammed into a clever acronym. (Ok, I'm a softy and I actually care and I've included some fundamentals in this post.)\n\nAdd to that some aphrodisiacs:\n\n* [New big dick CEO](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/) that deployed a turnaround story literally to Mars, prior to that he led Heinz's tendies dipping sauce team.\n* Q2 guidance teabagged the stock, so a surprise beat is very possible. Same for Q3.\n* Market Tailwinds: \"growth to value\" pick, should the trend continue. High divs, underpriced wrt peers.\n* Correlates with other squeeze stocks... is it still open season on shorts or nah?\n* Options are cheap as fuck (IV = 41%).\n\n...aaaaaand I'm hard.\n\nAlright. Enough foreplay. Let's get sniffing.\n\n# I. A Brief History of B&amp;G\n\nThe [full history](https://bgfoods.com/about/history/) of this perverted company is actually quite interesting, probably, if you read it. I didn't read it, I just mostly looked at the pictures:\n\n* In 1822 some Englishman started a condiment business in Boston in 1822, most likely to pay for the most advanced oral cosmetics of the day.\n* He then sells canned goods to Union troops.\n* That guy dies, but his freaky perverted goth sons takes over and make a deal with the devil to sell some unholy canned mixture of ground ham and \"special\" seasonings.\n* By 1889 two of these perverts become street walkers in Manhattan selling pickles by yelling \"get yer edible green dildos, here!\" from a horse and buggy.\n* In 1893 they they latch onto the BBC trend, and offer the not so subtle \"Cream of Wheat\"\n* While all this is going on, Mama Ortega squeezes out 13 kids, the 11th one establishes the \"Ortega\" brand.\n* I guess the freaky sons decided it a good idea to conglomerate a huge harem of the freakiest sounding brand names. Something about bagel chips too.\n* The rest is history!\n\nIn short, B&amp;G has a solid history of selling phallic foods and acquiring [euphemistic memeable brands](https://bgfoods.com/brands/) to create some sort of weird food brothel:\n\n* Green Giant\n* Cream of Wheat\n* Crisco\n* Skinny Girl\n* Clabber Girl\n* Baker's Joy\n* Moma Mary's\n* Grandma's\n* Accent Flavor Enhancer\n\nA true hags to riches story, this pimp of a company posted a record of $505m in Q1 sales, even in the face of supply shortages.\n\n# II. Fundamentals\n\n## Comps\n\nFirst, let's head to the red light district and do some window shopping:\n\n|Ticker|Name|NTM TEV/REV|NTM TEV/EBITDA|NTM P/E|NTM MC/FCF|Last Price|Mean Analyst Target|Market Cap|TEV|Dividend Yield|SI % Free Float (Ortex Est.)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BGS|B&amp;G Foods, Inc.|2.18x|11.97x|15.03x|10.92x|$32.99|$28.29|$2.14B|$4.46B|6.27%|21.92%|\n|MDLZ|Mondelez International, Inc.|3.82x|18.12x|21.67x|19.41x|$63.78|$68.07|$91.38B|$109.58B|2.10%|1.00%|\n|KHC|The Kraft Heinz Company|3.14x|12.82x|16.87x|12.79x|$43.42|$43.04|$53.11B|$78.30B|4.00%|2.14%|\n|GIS|General Mills, Inc.|2.83x|13.61x|16.97x|17.30x|$62.52|$62.57|$38.14B|$50.13B|3.64%|3.38%|\n|ADM|Archer-Daniels-Midland Company|0.68x|12.02x|15.68x|16.62x|$66.00|$68.21|$36.87B|$48.45B|2.54%|0.85%|\n|HRL|Hormel Foods Corporation|2.41x|17.62x|26.19x|32.69x|$48.78|$45.44|$26.44B|$25.98B|2.06%|5.48%|\n|MKC|McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated|4.77x|21.86x|29.91x|14.00x|$88.85|$88.68|$23.72B|$29.10B|1.54%|1.60%|\n|K|Kellogg Company|2.21x|13.09x|15.91x|15.51x|$65.16|$68.55|$22.19B|$30.64B|3.60%|7.05%|\n|CAG|Conagra Brands, Inc.|2.54x|12.16x|14.88x|14.32x|$37.33|$39.29|$17.92B|$27.42B|2.87%|3.39%|\n\nYou can see BGS is trading at a significant discount to her peers.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. One take is past company leadership hasn't been strong in developing and executing plans for growth or evolution of the company. They paid an unnecessarily high dividend at times (at various points it was a double digit % dividend), and prior management decided to accrue debt to complete deals even as it continued to pay high dividends.\n\nThey're also being shorted.\n\nTheir business is solid, though. From my perspective, I see a librarian with some light acne but with deep set sexual perversions just waiting for the right chad to unleash her. She's got nothing wrong with her, but she can't really sexually express herself comfortably -- until now she's just been dating some lazy ass cuck that can't find the clit.\n\nBasically: It\u2019s easier to fix broken management decisions quickly than to fix a broken underlying business. In BGS you have the former rather than the latter.\n\nSo how exactly will management get fixed?\n\n## New CEO\n\nEnter Kenneth \"Clit Killer\" Keller. Announced May 11th just before the Q1 earnings call, and starts this very day. Mans can find the clit.\n\nYou can read [the bio](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/), or just get erect right now:\n\n**\u2611 M&amp;A of a larger, high growth business**\n\n&gt;Most recently, Mr. Keller served as president and CEO of JDE Peet\u2019s NV, a $7 billion global coffee and tea company with over 20,000 employees based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He led the merger of Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE) and Peet\u2019s Coffee, Inc. and the successful initial public offering of the combined company in May 2020.\n\n**\u2611 Has literally led a company to Mars.** **\u2611 Can deliver a turnaround.**\n\n&gt;Prior to that, Mr. Keller served as global president of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, a subsidiary of Mars, Inc., where he was responsible for delivering sales and profit growth across the global gum, mints and candy business. In the United States, the company\u2019s largest global market, Mr. Keller led a turnaround of the Wrigley business, delivering growth well above the industry average. During the integration of Wrigley into Mars, Mr. Keller helped establish the global business units and strategy for the combined Mars-Wrigley confectionery business\n\n**\u2611 Former overlord of tendies dipping sauces.**\n\n&gt;He also worked at the H.J. Heinz Company in both the United States and Europe, leading the ketchup, condiments and sauces division in the United States\n\nThis guy has a solid track record of both turning around and growing companies that deal with packages that consumers put in their mouths (packaged foods, that is). It's a great sign he chose BGS for his next gig.\n\n## Q1 earnings, Q2 guidance\n\nFirst a reminder that this company absolutely crushed it during the start of COVID, where doomsday prepping of canned and frozen goods took hold. So, YoY comparisons were tough to beat. But beat them off it did.\n\nNet sales in Q1 rose to $505, from $449m last year, despite it being a tough comparison. The Crisco acquisition and strong net sales in the Spices and Seasonings brand area of $24.6 (47.5% Y/Y growth) more than offsetting reductions in Green Giant and other areas due to supply constraints (demand substantially exceeded supply -- a problem we all wish we had).\n\nE-commerce pimpery of their products increased by 60% Q1 '20 vs Q1 '21 to $50m. They expect it to grow to $250m for full year '21, and are focused on growing that aspect of the business. They also have the option to put Skinny Girl on OF, though it wasn't mentioned in the call.\n\nThe guidance for Q2? They're limited by supply, costs have risen, and last year's Q2 '20 will be difficult to top due to people stuffing their ~~panties~~ pantries. **This is very likely priced in,** as management was quite conservative on their earnings call and transparent about the supply issues, which aren't particularly severe to begin with. It's a good problem to have.\n\n[Further evidence this is priced in](https://www.barrons.com/articles/campbell-and-b-g-foods-have-outperformed-only-one-is-a-buy-for-this-analyst-51616436465):\n\n&gt;By contrast, he downgraded B&amp;G Foods (BGS) to Neutral from Overweight, while maintaining a $31 price target. Lavery writes that he finds it difficult to see upside to the stock\u2019s current valuation, especially as commodity-price inflation could lead to higher costs in the second half of this year and into 2022. That said, the company does have some ability to counteract this, like Campbell, via moves like hedging and price increases; even so, he estimates that B&amp;G Foods could face between 15% and 25% earnings per share risk this year\u2014and next\u2014if current commodity prices hold.\n\n## Addressing Risks\n\nAnalysts are treating BGS like it has ED, but **Green Giant is a grower not a shower**.\n\nBGS' supply chain and sales are primarily integrated across US, Canada, and Mexico vs many peers' more geographically dispersed sourcing and sales. BGS is thus well-insulated against global geopolitical/market trends toward de-globalization and global supply chain disruption risk, and has less exposure to ongoing COVID disruption due to North America's head start on vaccination and reopening.\n\nThey also have a strong history and relationship sourcing their inputs, which should give them an edge over private brands that will struggle to source competitively in a supply environment that's tighter than your wife's hot friends.\n\nIn short, anything they can source is sold, they're fuck buddies with COVID-proof and reliable growers, and as industry costs rise they can price better than the smaller off-brand competitors.\n\nGiven the worst is priced in, a good growing season is all it would take for a significant impact on the share price.\n\n# III. Macro Tailwinds and Catalysts\n\n## On COVID:\n\n* COVID lead to an unfortunate decline in eating out (pun intended, obviously). The upside to that is now consumers are slightly more apt at throwing frozen vegetables in the microwave. I expect that post-COVID people will remain more self-sufficient, and thus the demand for packaged goods will hopefully not decline much.\n* Even if the above is wrong: BGS's foodservice sales, which took an ass pounding from COVID, saw the beginnings of an uptick in March. This corresponds to the start of general reopening across the US as vaccine availability accelerated. Foodservice were still at pre-COVID levels in Q1, so Q2 should capture much more of that recovery, which might surprise in terms of speed and scale.\n* To the extent that people keep their COVID purchasing habits: As mentioned before: BGS e-commerce purchasing of their products increased by 60% Q1 '20 vs Q1 '21 to $50m. They expect it to grow to $250m for full year '21, and are focused on growing that aspect of the business.\n\n## On the Growth to Value rotation:\n\n* A further market shift from growth to value would be welcomed. BGS had no performance anxiety during COVID and offers a **6.3% yield**, and has authorized a **50m stock repurchase program**.\n* On the related subject of interest rates possibly rising: While they do have debt, they have limited exposure. The majority of their long-term debt, $1.45b is fixed-rate vs $906m variable rate.\n\n## Possible Catalysts:\n\n* As mentioned above, growth-to-value swing would really butter the biscuit.\n* If we see early signs of persistent COVID outbreaks, or vaccine-resistant variants, there will be another rush on BGS products. Also, as a stock BGS has proved resilient and a surprise upside performer, so it will be high on the list of defensive stocks.\n* Q2 earnings\n* Good crops of veggies throughout rest of year.\n* A short squeeze occurring from growth-to-value rotation\n* A short squeeze occurring in meme stocks (see below)\n\n# IV. Technicals\n\n## BGS SMELL Test\n\n[You can read about my SMELL test here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/)\n\n&gt;SMELL is my proprietary system scientifically engineered to maximize fear in the hearts of wall street. I identify tickers that have low liquidity (eg, their price moves up a lot per unit of inflow), but also have short interest and low implied volatility. I theorize this maximizes the chance that a squeeze or defensive posture by MMs happens, should a sustained inflow of capital occur. The result is, in theory, that buying inflows will lead to faster share price movements and rapid increases in IVs -- basically that options print.\n\n* **S**hort Interest: Exchange Reported: 25% float (May 28), Ortex: 22% (Jun 8).\n* **M**arket Cap: $2.14B\n* **E**xtremely Memeable: Green Giant. Crisco. Cream of Wheat.\n* **L**ow Liquidity: Avg Daily Volume: 1.18M shs ($39m), 1.8 % Market Cap, 72% inst ownership\n* **L**ow IV: \\~40%\n\nSmells good to me. I like the 72% inst. ownership, as well.\n\n## Boomer Fundamentals, Meme Price Action\n\nI didn't really see this ticker mentioned back in Jan, or during this squeeze cycle, but take a look here:\n\n[It tracks with the memes, like BBBY](https://preview.redd.it/2648ua3pu9571.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ad31751c0d6634ac6fa8745ec435b6be14a4885)\n\nIt looks like BGS likes getting groped just as much as the other memes. If/when a squeeze happens to the others, I'm betting that BGS rears its Green Giant Cock again. This is with zero catalysts -- I didn't find any [posts for BGS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=bgs+flair%3Add&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) on or around Jun 2, when it last popped. So, most likely, this pop comes from short books being stressed elsewhere. This is good.\n\n**In fact, BGS is the second highest shorted dividend stock.** First place? BBBY, which currently has an IV of 106%. Compare that to BGS's IV of 40%. Yeah, I'll be taking some LEAPs and seeing how squeeze season plays out.\n\nThe conclusion here: If meme season doesn't squeeze BGS, there's the possibility of sloppy seconds coming from growth-to-value rotation.\n\n## More notes on Short Interest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/1oiuwdsqu9571.jpg?width=3535&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd56d6af80bf3155b974e631682f86d73e46c570)\n\nSI Peaked in mid May (before/during earnings), and has been tapering off as:\n\n* Perhaps they fear the new CEO\n* Squeeze season comes into full swing\n\nOne of those will certainly continue, and the other is to be determined.\n\n# V. DeltaFlux (gamma/charm/vanna)\n\nLet's head over to the deltaflux tables. I like to look at the options chain of tickers to approximate if/how deltahedging is likely to have an effect.\n\n## BGS -- $32.71 (-$0.46 [-1.39%]) -- [DeltaFlux Tables Explained](https://old.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/ms7z36/deltaflux_tables_explained/)\n\n**OI as of:** Mon Jun 14 (at open) - **Date used for DTE**: Mon Jun 14, 2021 12:14 EST**Weighted Avg IV:** 50.07%, **Shares:** 64,750,000, **Float:** 63,430,000, **Avg Vol (10d):** 1,475,300\n\n|Price Point|\\# Shares DeltaHedged|\u2190 % Float|1% Price \u2206flux (sh)|\u2190 % Float / % Avg Vol|24hr \u2206flux (sh)|\u2190 % Float / % Vol|10% IV \u2206flux (sh)|\u2190 % Float / % Vol|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$22.50|\\-2,854,387|\\-4.50|54,992|0.08 / 3.73|\\-20,160|\\-0.03 / -1.37|103,286|0.16 / 7.00|\n|$25.00|\\-1,979,857|\\-3.12|107,662|0.16 / 7.30|\\-12,856|\\-0.02 / -0.87|96,675|0.15 / 6.55|\n|$27.50|\\-912,557|\\-1.44|114,528|0.18 / 7.76|\\-7,048|\\-0.01 / -0.48|80,345|0.13 / 5.45|\n|$30.00|213,233|0.34|151,636|0.24 / 10.28|\\-41,143|\\-0.06 / -2.79|82,723|0.13 / 5.61|\n|$32.50|1,621,584|2.56|195,276|0.32 / 13.24|\\-38,583|\\-0.06 / -2.62|44,557|0.07 / 3.02|\n|**c - $32.71**|1,747,885|2.76|196,734|0.32 / 13.34|\\-34,940|\\-0.06 / -2.37|38,756|0.06 / 2.63|\n|**o - $33.17**|2,023,961|3.19|198,129|0.32 / 13.43|\\-25,415|\\-0.04 / -1.72|25,103|0.04 / 1.70|\n|$35.00|3,056,114|4.82|180,296|0.30 / 12.22|19,767|0.03 / 1.34|\\-31,256|\\-0.05 / -2.12|\n|$37.50|4,112,994|6.48|123,335|0.21 / 8.36|45,680|0.07 / 3.10|\\-73,873|\\-0.12 / -5.01|\n|$40.00|4,742,784|7.48|75,261|0.13 / 5.10|25,816|0.04 / 1.75|\\-72,589|\\-0.11 / -4.92|\n|$42.50|5,111,324|8.06|48,980|0.08 / 3.32|10,683|0.02 / 0.72|\\-62,438|\\-0.10 / -4.23|\n|$45.00|5,346,477|8.43|34,374|0.06 / 2.33|5,792|0.01 / 0.39|\\-54,325|\\-0.09 / -3.68|\n|$47.50|5,505,160|8.68|24,854|0.04 / 1.68|3,779|0.01 / 0.26|\\-46,639|\\-0.07 / -3.16|\n\n## Notes\n\nIn my personal experience, gamma (1% price flux) values of &gt;0.30% float are significant, and I'm surprised to see them given that the option chain seems pretty sparse. I imagine more OI would extend this ramp significantly. It's also nice that vanna (10% IV flux) is currently positive. My read is that short term movement to $35.00 is easily possible.\n\n2.75% of float currently deltahedged is a nothing burger. It's not tying up much float, and so I don't suspect the current option chain is subtracting from liquidity -- but I think liquidity is low to begin with. Of course, if OI blows up, this number is likely to skyrocket as well.\n\nWhat's exciting to me is the % avg volume -- I'd consider &gt;4.00% to be pretty sizeable, and we're waaaay past that. If one were to believe that average volume were indicative of liquidity, then deltahedging could certainly start pushing the share price around, should it naturally move up (or down).\n\nFor reference, here are some other tickers' current peak values:\n\n|Ticker|% DeltaHedged|1% price flux % Float|1% price flux % Avg Vol|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**BGS**|2.75%|0.30%|11.43%|\n|WWE (before pop)|19.19%|0.14%|5.75%|\n|BBBY|6.74%|0.43%|4.55%|\n|CLNE|11.10%|0.26%|0.65%|\n|CLOV|28.38%|0.82%|0.27%|\n|AMC|23.75%|0.25%|0.42%|\n|GME|18.38%|0.39%|1.50%|\n\n# VI. Positions and Closing Remarks\n\nI see significant upside:\n\n* Short Term: If squeeze season is still in effect, this currently tracks with meme stocks like BBBY. This is all without any significant coverage on WSB. If near-term rotation-to-value occurs, there is likely some upside there as well.\n* Mid Term: Q2 guidance was conservative, and I believe the downside is priced in. Given that, a surprise Q2 is a major possibility. A slower rotation from growth to value would also work. BGS has a juicy dividend and is priced at a discount to its peers.\n* Long Term: New CEO started **today**. Proven track record. For the foreseeable future, BGS will be limited only by supply, and not demand. I have faith on their ability to execute -- great relationships with suppliers and competitive pricing. Can reach price commensurate with its peers.\n\nI think downside is priced in, given some analysts did some scat play with it due to supply concerns.\n\nOther things I like:\n\n* Passes the SMELL test\n* Options are dirt cheap\n* Green Giant, Crisco, Cream of Wheat\n\n## Don't YOLO, etc\n\nNone of this is financial advice. Don't go crazy with this and don't blame me if it doesn't moon. If share price or IV spike, then wait for a better entry or the next opportunity.\n\n## My positions\n\nI'm playing a little bit of everything. Yes, I have a lot of different calls, but this isn't a YOLO. It's about 5% of my options book.\n\n* 10% - Jun: $35 - Betting on miracle spike like with WWE.\n* 30% - Jul: $35, $37.50, $40 - Betting on squeeze season carrying BGS, and/or growth-to-value rotation.\n* 30% - Aug: $35, $37.50, $40 - Betting on Q2 blowout and/or growth-to-value rotation.\n* 20% - Jan: $35 - Betting long term CEO, Q2 and/or Q3 blowout. Valuation approaches that of peers.\n* 10% - Chance your wife has an STD",

        "selftext": "Good morning gamblers, \n\n**For a brief overview** - Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies. [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/) Their unique selling point is a modular platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. This \u2018skateboard\u2019 platform is largely what drew Apple\u2019s interest. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)\n\nCanoo is bringing its first vehicle to market next year with its electric microbus/van available at a base price of $34,750 before tax incentives or add-ons. It\u2019s now taking preorders in the United States for the \u201clifestyle\u201d vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van. Canoo is taking a different route than many other electric vehicle manufacturers, which played a role in the interest from Apple and Hyundai. Canoo\u2019s trio of vehicles all have the same proprietary \u201cskateboard\u201d platform architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis that sits under the vehicle\u2019s cabin. This contributes to a similar design language between the vehicles, which all have the same wide front windshield and relatively low profile. [link](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/)\n\nA quick glance at its balance sheet shows that they aren\u2019t at risk of running out of cash anytime soon. Their total assets are $717.8M (of which cash and cash equivalents are $641.9M) and total liabilities are $107.6M (of which long-term debt is $6.9M).[link](https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-21-007431/goev-20210331x10q.htm#CondensedConsolidatedBalanceSheetsinthou)\n\n**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**\n\n1. **High short interest: Yes,** ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV) \n\n2. **Low float: Yes,** total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV).  \n\n3. **Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes,** Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest), Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev). \n\n4. **High short ratio: Yes,** based on the volume numbers above \u2013 we\u2019re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn\u2019t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks. [shortsqueeze 5.3 link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&amp;submit=Short+Quote) and [Nasdaq 11.3 link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)\n\n**Additional points**\n \n1.**There\u2019s room to run** - a squeeze would not initially be setting an ATH since the stock is currently down 51.5% [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) from its ATH with a market cap of $2.3 Billion. This is primarily due to an overhaul in management as well as a change in the business model which favored protecting Canoo\u2019s IP instead of providing it to other OEMs, still ended up bring the SP down short-term since it was radically different from when they went public. \n\n2.**Shorts running into a wall** - 150,000 shares are left available to borrow at a rate of 24.5%, which is 0.15% of the entire float so shorts are about to hit a wall in terms of how easy it is to manipulate the share price. [link](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/goev)\n\n3.**Possible PT** \u2013 unlike all the other information which is part data part speculation, this is **pure speculation** since we're talking about pre-revenue but I really think you could easily 10x the current share price if it\u2019s a momentum based squeeze since it's a short-term event that isn't based on technicals. Valuations based on fundamentals aren\u2019t really the same as they were a couple of years ago, and given the low interest rate / easy access to cash the question really is how high can it go? Since institutions don't hold the majority of the float (they currently only hold ~24% of the float but have increased their position by ~120% in the last month) and there should therefore theoretically be a smaller likelihood of shenanigans with lower price manipulation, this could easily 10x the current share price to $100 if more retail become aware of the company's potential and buy-in to their long-term vision, and additional institutions start buying in. Personally speaking, I like to look at market caps to see how high things can go \u2013 with GME and AMC both were hovering under a $20 Billion market cap before AMC blew open the gates a couple of weeks back. Other tickers that went up in the last week like WISH and CLOV however hit around a $10 Billion market cap before coming back down. If we use that $10B market cap to be conservative, that still gets us to almost $50, which is 5x the current share price \u2013 and since you can make a case for Canoo\u2019s short interest being higher than the previous two cases, I don\u2019t see why it couldn\u2019t reach that by the end of the month, or even within a week if shorts start to cover and bring the house down.\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\n1. **Upcoming investor day this Thursday (June 17th)**, which will be a \u2018hybrid in-person and virtual journey into Canoo\u2019s product portfolio and business strategy.\u2019 [link](https://canooirday.com/)\n \n2. **Canoo is being added to the Russel 3000 index,** [link](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) meaning that the stock along with other additions could be expected to \u2018trade more than their average daily volume in the Nasdaq Closing Cross on June 25, and some will trade an entire week\u2019s volume on \u201cRussell Friday\u201d.\u2019 [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-small-caps-should-know-about-the-russell-rebalance-2020-06-22).\n\nOn a final note, this is not financial advice so please don\u2019t treat it as such \u2013 do your own due diligence, read your own news, study their financials and evaluate multiple perspectives (bullish and bearish) to see what others are saying. Don\u2019t invest money you\u2019re not willing to lose, and do so at your own risk.\n\n**TLDR**:  Canoo is among the healthiest EV startups out there, $641.9 million in cash, only $6.9 million in long-term debt and a market cap of just $2.3 billion with a &lt;$10 share price. This is the company that Apple wanted to buy and Hyundai wanted to partner with. Other EVs have the same market cap and may not even have the cash to make it through the next 3 months so Canoo really should be trading at multiples of where it is atm. Price is trending upwards \u2013 11.8% in last week, 32.9% in last month \u2013 someone\u2019s been loading up while it\u2019s cheap (institutional ownership is up 119.2% over the last 3 months).

        "selftext": "&gt;The prices of so-called meme stocks may be distorted because the majority of trades in those names are executed away from public exchanges where share price formation occurs, the head of the New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday.\n\n&gt;\u201cMeme stocks,\u201d which often start as low-priced, highly shorted stocks that users of online forums such as Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets rally behind, are some of the most heavily traded and volatile shares on any given day.\n\n&gt;Shares of companies like video game retailer GameStop Corp (GME.N) and theater chain operator AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) have whipsawed this year, with GameStop having rallied more than 1,600% in January alone, prompting trading halts by some brokers and sparking Congressional and regulatory hearings.\n\n&gt;\"In some of the meme stocks that we've seen, or stocks that have a high level of retail participation, the vast majority of order flow can trade off of exchanges, which is problematic,\" said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) NYSE.\n\n&gt;\"That price formation is not really reflective of what supply and demand is,\" she said at a conference hosted by CNBC.\n\n&gt;Retail trading surged during the coronavirus pandemic, helped by a shift by retail brokerages to commission-free trading, with individual traders now responsible for around 35% of market volume, up from 20% pre-pandemic.\n\n&gt;In meme stocks, individual traders contribute as much as 70% of the volume, Cunningham said.\n\n&gt;The majority of retail orders bypass exchanges because of an arrangement called payment for order flow, in which retail brokerages sell their customers' marketable orders to wholesale brokers. The wholesalers match the orders internally, trying to profit off of the bid-ask spread, while offering retail traders the best market price or better.\n\n&gt;Retail brokers say payment for order flow lowers overall costs for individual traders.\n\n&gt;But the practice raises conflict of interest questions and will be included in a broad review of stock market rules, Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said last week.\n\n&gt;The review will also examine whether off-exchange trading - which is about 50% of the market when institutional block trades are included - distorts the price discovery mechanism for stocks, Gensler said.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-2021-06-16/",

        "selftext": "I'll start with the usual: I am not a financial advisor.  I do not provide financial advice! Everything following this is opinion/observation.  Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others.\n\nOBLIGATORY - BuY &amp; HoDl!\n\nNow that that is out of the way, I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point.  The below have DD's that are a must read if you have not already; please visit their profiles and read their posts.  I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below.\n\nu/Criand:\n\n[1)]**The flurry of rules before the storm. GME might be hitting T+35 and T+21 next week**\n\n[2)]**Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup**\n\nu/myplayprofile - I am highlighting just one of their posts, but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME &amp; AMC prices.  AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis post is focused on u/Criand's DD, which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day / 31 day FTD cycles.\n\nBasically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles, and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days.\n\nKey Points:\n\n* He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T+21 day FTD cycles, which have been shown to cause price surges, do not act the same way as they did during the $480 run and the $350 run.\n* Explains how the Feb-March $350 run was caused by a dual event of T+35 &amp; T+21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another (back to back trading days)\n* Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to $350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at $350\n* He references u/yelyah2 DD, which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the $480 and $350 price run ups, returns to normal for about a week, and then spikes up massively again, initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes\n\nBelow is my furtherment of u/Criand's work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now.  Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.\n\nPlease click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat... EVER.\n\n[Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T+35 \\/ T+21 day price movements + 6 days \\(because it has only been 6 trading days since ](https://preview.redd.it/v8tmo6hdi5371.png?width=1287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77)\n\nNotes:\n\n* I am not sure why I called the $480 and $350 price run ups in the visual \"Micro Squeezes\", but thats what came to mind.  Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u/yelyah2 recent DD?\n* Yellow is micro squeeze 1\n* Blue is micro squeeze 2\n* Pink is the past 6 days\n\nAlright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.\n\nKey observations:\n\n* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points\n* In the aftermath of the January \"micro squeeze\" the Dec-Jan price floor of \\~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.     In the aftermath of the Feb 24th - Mar 10th \"micro squeeze\" the price floor of \\~$40 **TRIPLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$120 between Feb 5-25.  Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)\n* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that \"We can\u2019t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20-&gt;+80-&gt;+140? Or what if +20-&gt;+80-&gt;+20-&gt;+80?\"  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **\"could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?\"** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.\n* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.\n   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)\n   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)\n   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)\n\nAdditionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.\n\n* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%\n* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.\n* 770 / 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.\n* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \\~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.\n* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.\n* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely \"coincidental\" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.\n* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.\n* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)\n\nOh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!\n\nAlright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.\n\n**This is not my original post**",

        "selftext": "I recently commented on a post about GME that I sell covered calls (henceforth CCs) on meme stocks. The reception to the comment was poor \u2013 35 downvotes and counting. Upon reviewing responses to my comment, I realized that many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of CCs. I hope to clear some of those up and introduce in what may be a new strategy to those who read this.\n\n**What does it mean to sell covered calls?**\n\nTo sell a covered call means to buy 100 shares of a stock and then sell a call option against the shares. When you sell the call, you collect a premium upfront. If the underlying stock is above the strike price on the expiry date, you will get assigned. Since you are \u201ccovered\u201d and own 100 shares of the underlying, you can deliver your shares to the holder of the call to satisfy your obligation. If the stock is below the strike price on the expiry date, you get to keep the shares. In either situation, the premium is yours to keep.\n\nThis strategy is different than selling a naked call option (i.e., selling a call without owning the underlying). In that strategy, you lose $1 for every cent the stock is above the strike price at expiry. With CCs, you own 100 shares of the stock, so those 100 shares were also able to make $1 for every cent in price appreciation. In essence, with CCs you are selling the upside above the strike price to the long of the trade.\n\n**Three strategies compared under four scenarios**\n\nThe best way to demonstrate why I believe this strategy is so valuable is to compare trading outcomes under four strategies \u2013 selling covered calls, owning 100 shares outright, and owning a call option.\n\nFor this example, I will use AMC shares which last traded at $54.23 and a 55 strike July 2 expiry call which last traded at $4.25. This example is for AMC, but this can be done with any stock if you substitute the applicable pricing.\n\nIf this is too much reading, I\u2019ve summarized what I believe is the best trading strategy in each price band within the chart below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8c622ynpkw771.png?width=2604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8793805dbc8f0b621940bc7dc42bf1cb4d1b3640\n\n*Scenario 1 \u2013 AMC goes down (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning a call)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares will lose money; however, because you collected a premium, you are still ahead if AMC finishes above $49.98 ($54.23-$4.25). Even if AMC finishes below $49.98, you can \u201croll\u201d your option to a different expiry and collect more premium.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will lose money.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425. I am giving this one a tie because if the stock tanks, the call has a 100% loss but in dollar terms the loss is limited. So in a sense the winner depends on how much the stock falls and if you believe the stock will recover in the future.\n\n*Scenario 2 \u2013 AMC stays at $54.23 (Winner: selling covered calls)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares neither make nor lose money; however, you profit the premium received of $425. Since $54.23 is below the strike of $55, you can roll the option to a different expiry and collect more premium.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares neither make nor lose money.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425.\n\n*Scenario 3 \u2013 AMC finishes in the range of $55-$59.25 (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning 100 shares outright)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares participate in the upside up until $55. This would mean a $77 profit on the shares (\\[$55-$54.23\\] x 100). You would also keep the premium of $425 which brings the total profit to $502. You would lose the shares as the stock finished above $55.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. So, if AMC finishes at $59.25, the profit would be $502 (\\[$59.25-$54.23\\] x 100).\n* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.25, you would breakeven (\\[$59.25-$55-$4.25\\] x 100).\n\n*Scenario 4 \u2013 AMC finishes above $59.68 (Winner: owning a call)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: Same as scenario 3. The profit is $502 and you lose your shares.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $545.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $42.69 (\\[$59.68-$55-$4.25\\] x 100). As a percentage of the original investment, this strategy has a higher ROI than owning 100 shares outright for stock prices above $59.68.\n\nThere are a few gaps in these scenarios, but the point should be clear by now. Selling covered calls is profitable in scenarios 2-4 and in scenario 1 if the stock is above $49.98. Owning 100 shares is profitable in scenarios 3 and 4 while owning a call was profitable in only scenario 4.\n\nThis is why I love selling covered calls \u2013 it is profitable in more market conditions than the other trading strategies. It will outperform other strategies unless the underlying stock makes a large move to the upside.\n\n**Misconceptions**\n\nI came across a few misconceptions in responses to my comment. Here are a few of them.\n\n*You can\u2019t make money on CCs if the stock goes up.* \u2013 Absolutely you would. If the stock goes up, you get to keep the premium. Only in selling a naked call would you not make money in this situation.\n\n*You shouldn\u2019t sell CCs on a high IV stock.* \u2013 Assuming you're bullish on the stock, high IV stocks are the best to target as you can collect more premium. This point is only correct if you anticipate a large downward move in the stock that would lose more than the premium received.\n\n*You should sell puts instead of CCs if you\u2019re bullish on the stock.* \u2013 There\u2019s some nuance to this, but this point is mostly incorrect. Due to something called put-call parity, selling a put is conceptually nearly identical to selling a covered call.\n\n**Downsides:**\n\nThere are a few downsides to CCs which you should consider before trading.\n\n*Funds required* \u2013 Selling covered calls requires owning 100 shares of the stock. This is capital intensive. Consider buying 100 shares of GME which would cost $20,800. Buying a GME July 2 expiry call with 0.71 delta (meaning you get price appreciation that replicates owning 71 shares) only costs about $2,443.\n\n*Stock tanks and never recovers* \u2013 If the stock tanks and never recovers, you won\u2019t be able to recoup your losses; however, even if this happens, your outcome is better than the other strategies from before since you got to keep the premium.\n\n*The upside is limited* \u2013 Your upside is capped at the strike price. If there\u2019s a strong movement upwards, the other strategies are better; however, there may be situations where you call \u201croll\u201d your option up in strike and out in expiry. This may allow you to keep stock.\n\nConclusion: Selling covered calls are an underrated trading strategy that is often misunderstood. It is profitable in a wide range of trading environments. Sure it may not be as \"sexy\" as buying FDs and it won't get you rich overnight, but it can possibly provide strong and consistent returns over time.",

This seems to me to be the next runner from AMC and GME. \n\nBoth GME and AMC were hugely shorted previously when the rallies started, and now that short interest has decreased. It still is there but has decreased and that's why I think we've seen momentum change.\n\nToday, AMC took a massive hit due to the company offering nearly 12 million stocks for purchase which hurt many peoples wins and likely some that hasn't invested sooner. \n\nI expect GME and AMC will likely both continue to increase if stocks are held.

        "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nI\u2019m extremely bullish on AMC. In fact, more than I was back in late January and early February. The inflation rate, collateral issues, and reverse repos are all factors that lead me to believe that investors are inching ever so closer to creating heavy losses for hedge funds and short sellers. As you may be aware, during the AMC shareholder count that occurred on June 2nd, CEO Adam Aaron stated retail investors comprise 80% of AMC shares with each individual averaging about 120 shares each. As of 9am EST this Wednesday morning, AMC has seen 1.76 million trades, and despite no new huge news, it\u2019s already seeing a gradual decrease from yesterday\u2019s close. So why are so many people selling? That\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t think we are. Earlier this morning, Jim Cramer commented on AMC\u2019s price action in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1405138423741100033):\n\n\u201cMeme people AMC is down\u2026. I think it\u2019s time to burst in.\u201d Now this is entirely speculation on my part, but I believe that this could be serving as a cover for a short ladder attack, which is something that many GME, AMC, and other tickers are familiar with. That being said, I do expect the rest of today and this trading week to be rather ugly. However, no one said that a ride to the moon would be a smooth one. In the past 5 months alone, retail investors have caused billions of dollars worth of losses to hedge funds and overall people that want to screw over working class people. In fact, this past Monday (the 14th), when AMC surged 15%, it caused over $515 million worth of losses. This is chump change compared to some of the other numbers we\u2019ve seen, but they add up. Another interesting piece of information I learned is that recent reports showed that AMC is the most traded stock on Fidelity and Freetrade, and the 3rd most traded stock on Robinhood. Just take look below.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1agt5p2p0n571.png?width=1495&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2ca6fcbd7807333102d8674635b8851cb175d979\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykdc6hmq0n571.jpg?width=1408&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1d81f7f5ca89f3b3ed5b7b8c4c342a03a068ddbd\n\nI personally dislike the Motely Fool, but it allowed me to view information provided by Robinhood. As you can see, sentiment for AMC remains high across multiple brokerages.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji7s761s0n571.png?width=1940&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d5937d5adab17070ada855f0ec8beb31a600bf8\n\nAs of June 2nd, AMC has managed to remain above $42.72 and this has continued for two whole weeks! This has resulted in devastating losses for short sellers. It went as far as touching $70 just two weeks ago. And although it is currently in the mid-50\u2019s range, I believe that bullish sentiment from traders will allow it to continue to climb even in the face of short ladder attacks. According to the data on Webull, AMC has seen more large-scale orders recently. This might be due to the amount of options expiring this Friday, the 18th. Down below, I\u2019ve listed the large-scale buy orders placed and executed in the last 5 trading days:\n\n6/09: $1,829,580\n\n6/10: $4,826,810\n\n6/11: $6,961,840\n\n6/14: $5,458,670\n\n6/15: $9,946,860\n\nMind you, this is the net value of all large-scale orders that were placed those days. In other words, it took the difference from all the large-scale buys as well as the large-scale sells. The final numbers for all of those dates came out to a positive number, meaning there were more buys than sells. That doesn\u2019t even take into account people buying from RH, Etrade, Fidelity, etc. Needless to say, buying pressure is immense right now, which may the reason there has been an increase of FUD, shills, and bots trying to direct people away from AMC and into other tickers and ultimately tricking them into losing their money into a pump and dump.\n\nIn terms of good news, AMC is currently poised to become the dominant movie theatre chain in L.A., which would include two shopping mall locations. With both tourists and locals visiting during the summer, and with more and more Americans receiving the vaccine and the desire to return to normal coming along with it, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see significant increases in revenue as time goes on. This change might not be an immediate one, of course, but it does force investors to consider the long-term plays that come with it.\n\nShort sellers can\u2019t hold forever, but investors can. Short interest will slowly eat away at them and one day, as we all know, they\u2019ll be forced to cover. When this happens, it\u2019ll be every man for himself. Seeing as to how many of us control the stock, though, we could, in theory, just not sell, which would cause an unprecedented rise in stock price. It should be common sense by now that we know that this cannot be accomplished by a single individual, hence the phrase: \u201cApes together strong.\u201d \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nTL;DR I feel as though bitch boy Cramer and his ass-kissing gay bear friends are working extra hard to get people to paper-hand. He wants our bananas, but I refuse to give it to him. I think there are plenty of catalysts that not only make the current price sustainable, but on the verge of further increasing. As always, I\u2019m not a financial advisor. Do your own research before making any investment decisions. I just like the stock. AMC to the moon, my friends \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15",

        "selftext": " Hello fellow Redditors! Here i will present you Due Diligence on a company i searched a lot and believe in it short and long term. Not only me but millions of people and huge names like **Shaquille o'Neal, Lebron James, and Arnold Schwarzenegger** since they are all shareholders in the company. The triple threat!!!\n\nI will try in this DD to mention with few words the most important things you need to know and ill try to do it in a way that wont get you tired to read all the post till the end! Clean and simple for you. Have fun and invest with your own risk to lose or earn!\n\nLets start the story with an\n\n**Amazing All Star Management Team**:\n\nThe BeachBody team includes three former Disney senior executives \u2014 **Staggs, Mayer, and Salil Mehta**, its chief financial officer. Other directors, officers, and strategic advisors include Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Peter Schlessel, Keith Horn, Sheila Stamps, Teresa Miles Walsh, and Martin Luther King III.Dont forget also Sue Collyns. No need to just mention that Staggs ([former Disney COO](https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/tom-staggs-disney-out-steps-down-bob-iger-1201745196/)) and Mayer (previously chairman of Disney\u2019s Direct-to-Consumer and International and [briefly CEO of TikTok](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/tiktok-kevin-mayer-resigns-1234750556/)) who both serve as co-CEOs and co-chairs of the board are higly valued and insightfull people along with all the others. Also worth mentioning that in the board also joined a member of **GME** board. Lastly CEO of the company is **Carl Daikeler** who managed to raise a company from VHS tapes to a behemoth that has 22 years of presence without debt and clears above 1+ billion in revenues. All star team with all star celebrities along their side each one valuable for their guidance. I will put some links from Shaqs and Arnold twitter along with Ross Gerber twitter who is bullish from Day 1 like he was in Tesla with their support in the company.\n\n[https://twitter.com/SHAQ/status/1407759264978931716](https://twitter.com/SHAQ/status/1407759264978931716)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1405573349896429570](https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1405573349896429570)\n\n[https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1407373786530271241](https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1407373786530271241)\n\n**Lets continue with what exactly $BODY brings to the market**:\n\nWell $BODY was a 3 way merger means yoou have BeachBody, Openfit and Myx Fitness all together.\n\n**BeachBody on Demand Interactive (BODi)**\n\nBeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD\u2019s and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article [here.](https://tbc-cms-prod-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tbc-cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19060123/BODi-Press-Release.pdf)\n\n**OpenFit PartnerShips**\n\nOpenFit (backed by Lebron &amp; Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article [here.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005208/en/Openfit-and-Concierge-Health-Announce-At-Home-Exercise-Incentives)\n\nOpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness over 700 physical locations , giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link [here.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)\n\n**Myx Fitness**\n\nA simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer.But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition. I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one. Interestingly, Myx has sold over 27,000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month. The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at $1,299 is $600 cheaper than peloton\u2019s basic bike.\n\n**Nutrition (thats a big one) Shakeology**\n\nShakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life. They\u2019ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020, \u201cthe sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport\u00ae, a third-party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270+ substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label\u201d\n\nYou can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info.\n\nLets continue with\n\n**Quick Financial Overview:** 1.1B (est) revenue for 2021, 68% gross margins on that rev (which is better than NFLX, DIS, PTON, etc). Digital subscriptions have 89% margins. 43% YoY revenue increase for Q1. Added literally a million subscribers YoY. 400M free cash on the books upon merger w/ no debt. Also expanding to 10+ countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now. Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post. Beach body already has more than 2.6 + **MILLION** paid digital subscribers. We will talk about subscribers, coaches and followers below. All in all, this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion (in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33% by 2027, $59B) which happens to have a few meme-like qualities and dont forget **NO DEBT.**\n\n**2021 Q1 Financials**\n\nTotal Revenue: $243M - 43% increase YoY\n\nTotal Subscriptions: 3.2M - 39% increase (record high)\n\n(Not an actual earnings report, assumed to be released after merger)\n\n**Q2** mentioned on interview will be even better.\n\n**Future Plans &amp; News**\n\nHere\u2019s where they\u2019re really making moves. Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they\u2019ll have what they referred to as a \u201cwar chest\u201d of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&amp;A, marketing, and expansion.\n\n**International Expansion**\n\nThe team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10+ countries in the near future.\n\n**THATS IMPORTANT**. Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers.\n\nIf you check company's website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers, almost 3 million paid subs, thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people. Celebrities backing this one Lebron, Shaq, and Arnold together have 70 !!!! million followers. Insiders have also thousands of followers, so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people. **A cult that loves Beachbody.**\n\nImportant also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order o connect with each other, in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people, subs and coaches to connect each other.\n\nLets talk about\n\n**Tech in Fitness**\n\nAnytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in.\n\nWhat about???\n\n**Future of At-Home Connected Fitness**\n\nWhy would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005351/en/The-Future-of-Fitness-Americans-Embrace-a-Hybrid-of-Home-Exercise-and-Gym-Workouts) and [here](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/home-workouts-future-of-fitness). A survey of 3500 American by *The New Consumer* and Coefficient Capital found that 76% of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic\u2014and crucially, 66% prefer it. Among millennials, the number is even higher: 82% made the switch and 81% like it more. Link to article [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90587575/gyms-arent-coming-back-heres-how-youll-work-out-in-the-future).\n\nSay the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes.\n\nLets see if there is any\n\n**Bear Case**\n\nNone. Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50-100 pps because bears are getting nervous.\n\nFinally most important\n\n**PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze (summer lemonade) POTENTIAL**\n\n**Check this image**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[8.8&amp;#37; only public shares](https://preview.redd.it/unkrgq17gh771.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6849de07ad327d6a808d1f44d4fc55147312d165)\n\n\u200b\n\nMonday $BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available for shareholders that makes it a low float stock. Already buying pressure from retail is obvious. Already many tutes have positions with big names among them **74 total tutes, 65 long only**, 1 short only, 8 long/short with a total of 9 million shares already. As of 15/6 Short float was **20% !!!! in an already low floater**. Check this tweet for proof\n\n[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112)\n\nStock already hit 18+ back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20% short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50% of its value. Now shares remaining are very low because **most float is locked**. Shorts need aprox. 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure.\n\nDont forget Monday $BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above. This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering.\n\n**IMPORTANT--&gt;** Retail shareholders have high conviction and not selling shares, Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41%, same applies for the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown **Silicon Valley** investors.\n\n**More MEMEish features**\n\n\u200b\n\n* $BODY ticker (hard to ignore) [This](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html) article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without. Its summer anyways right?\n* Comparison to PTON\n* Arnold, Lebron, and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders. Collectively, they have 128.7M followers on IG alone. You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company. Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to **gold**, no need to mention other tickers we all know. Who goes against these guys? Everyone loves them.\n* Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both former Disney execs, will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth, post-merge. Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney+, also former TikTok CEO\n* 1+ billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that **without DEBT** at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion.\n\nI dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search. All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer. **The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders, insiders and celebrities is the biggest online digital fitness subscription tech and nutrition company for the masses in the market. Its the PTON for 99% and the Netflix of digital fitness , all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with.**\n\nSome people say $BODY to 0, 5, 20, 30, 50, 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float **everything is doable with volume**. Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine , and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1. First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them. Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes. **DEEP VALUE** my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like. Everyone likes the stock it seems in social media and you know the power of social media from Kitty.\n\n**Tip---&gt; No pumpers (yet) on $BODY its a pure fundamental - growth - behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages. They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team.**\n\n**Also dont forget $BODY rings the bell this Monday 25/6.**\n\nBig thanks fortaking some parts from the DD of Traditional-Studio-5 and some other BB followers. Any mistake i may not have seen please contact me to fix it asap since i double checked. Sorry for any typos also. Enjoy!",

        "selftext": "**OK APES IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING START TO THE SUMMER ALREADY AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET EVEN MORE INTERESTING**\n\n\nAll our favorite stocks in GME, AMC, BB, CLNE, CLOV, WKHS are spiking and it's a retard's dream come true.  Only problem is that we seem to be a bit scattered currently with almost 7 different tickers being mentioned over and over again.  Let's get straight to the point, we want to make money.  (By the way I'm not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded).  Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:\n\n\n\n**CLNE.**\n\n\n\nNow don't get me wrong, there's another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked.  But we're talking about Mr. Clean right now.  \n\n\n\n**How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?** \n\n\n\nWell, it's the only one with the government on our side.  Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles?  This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call \"Renewable Natural Gas\" (RNG).  \n\n\n\n**So how the fuck are they doing this??**\n\n\n\nLet me explain.  The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that's not a good number for us.  But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that's captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative.  And who eats this shit up??  Amazon.  Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses.  Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.  \n\n\n[Source](https://investors.cleanenergyfuels.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clean-energy-signs-agreement-amazon-low-and-negative-carbon-rng)  \n\n\n\n**Price**\n\n\n\nThe stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being.  I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that.  Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10.  The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00  \n\n\n[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE)\n\n\n\nIt's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate.  The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short.  That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.  \n\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f](https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f)\n\n\n\n**The Play?**\n\n\n\nShares.  The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely.  And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.  \n\n\n\n**TL;DR:**  Cow farts go BRRRRRRR.

        "selftext": "&gt; (Bloomberg) -- Wall Street\u2019s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders\u2019 most-popular meme stocks.\n\n&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, according to people familiar with the moves. The banks are trying to protect themselves against fallout from extreme surges and dips that have characterized trading in companies including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., M***oV****n Inc. and GameStop Corp.\n\n&gt; The changes mean some hedge funds and other institutional investors now face higher collateral requirements or are limited from shorting certain stocks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal policy decisions.\n\n&gt; \u201cUntil further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options\u201d in GameStop, AMC and M***oV****n, the firm said in a memo to clients seen by Bloomberg News. Naked options allow investors to short a stock without owning the underlying securities. Jefferies, which told clients that other stocks may be added to the list, will also no longer permit short sales of those securities.\n\n&gt; Representatives of Goldman, Bank of America,Citigroup and Jefferies declined to comment. It\u2019s not unusual for banks to adjust their risk controls as market conditions change.\n\n&gt; The measures may change the fortunes of retail investors lighting up Reddit message boards with their forays into day trading. Increased margin requirements could hasten the short squeezes small investors have been rushing to capitalize on. On the other hand, if hedge funds pull back on short bets due to the new restrictions, the Reddit crowd won\u2019t have as many opportunities to chase short squeezes.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-banks-rein-hedge-190856404.html",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nDue to a recent surge in this sort of activity I'm putting out in the public a stance /r/investing has held for some time.  This post will be linked in the rules for future clarification needs.   \n\nEver since the GME fiasco Reddit has been the site of an unprecedented amount of deliberate manipulation, bad faith interaction, and attempted pumping.  Because we are one of the larger financial subreddits we have had to deal with this front on - and we have stuck to our longstanding policy regarding brigading.  \n\nIn the last two weeks we have banned over 300 users tied to at least 7 different subreddits for this behavior.  I don't know what the fuck is going on but for whatever reason everyone forgot how to interact like an adult on Reddit in the last three months so here we are.  This is an investment sub, we talk about boring shit like stocks, bonds, markets, whatever - none of us have to be dealing with this subredditdrama style nonsense.  It's fucking childish. \n\n**First, a bit of history for the new users**\n\nThis policy dates back to mid 2013, in the origional Crypto craze there was a concerted effort by bad actors to establish subreddits focused on their new altcoin or cryptocurrency, then organize a brigade of various investment subreddits.  We reached out to the moderators of /r/cryptocurrency and they added our sub to their filters to prevent this sort of behavior from becoming an issue.  The admins also removed a few users and crypto subs that were created for this purpose.  \n\nHedgefundaspirations, Crasymike, a few older investment mods, and I held a policy way back then (Even before I was a mod here, and prior to this account even) of permanently banning anyone who participated in this activity.  The point here, is this is not a new policy, it's not reactive to any recent market events, and it's not going away.  We are not concerned with whether something is accurate, inaccurate, etc, we are not taking a pro/con stance on any given security or investment - we are taking a definitive stance against such bad faith interaction as we always have since the very early days of this sub. \n\n---------\n\n**The Policy**\n\nThe moment we determine that a brigade is occurring we will automatically and permanently ban anyone who participated in that brigade.  No questions asked, and no appeals given outside of very rare circumstances.  We will also remove the topic, lock comments, and potentially examine the idea of preventing any discussion on that topic for some time - regardless of if it may be a good faith question.   \n\n**What is a brigade?**\n\nAny attempt to gather members of a different subreddit, especially one focused on a specific security, investment, or stance, to come to /r/investing and do any of the following: \n\n - Educate the posters\n\n - Correct \"FUD\"\n\n - \"Share information\" about a given security\n\n - Correct some perception of bad actors - if you have reason to believe people in our sub are acting in bad faith then contact the moderation team.  DO NOT go post in some sub taking the opposite stance to gather reinforcements. \n\n - Share your stance/opinion, or information you believe to be true.\n\n**In short: if you are on a subreddit that is focused on a specific security, investment, or stance and you see someone there reference a post on /r/investing (link, a screen shot, a comment saying \"this is happening over at /r/investing, whatever), then you go post on /r/investing to express your stance you are getting a ban.**  If you spend all day in a subreddit focused on a given security, investment, or stance and you happen to \"innocently\" come across a post here on that subject you had better make absolutely sure nobody in the offending sub has mentioned /r/investing yet - because you're getting lumped in with brigaders if not.  \n\nI want to be very transparent about this - we do not care what you posted.  It could be a profane rant or a kind hearted link to a reputable source.  We care that you are participating in a broad bad faith engagement on Reddit.  After we lock/remove the thread we are able to see which users came from the offending sub very easily - and they will all get a ban.  \n\n**Just to be clear:** \n\nThis is not brigading: a post in /r/valueinvesting pointing out an interesting discussion on /r/investing, and users coming over to participate.  We are happy to facilitate good faith interaction between various communities.\n\nThis is brigading: a post on /r/AppleStockLovers about how someone on /r/investing talked shit about Apple stock.  And you coming over here to just let that person know you disagree.\n\nI tend to think anyone who can use a computer should be smart enough to understand when they are acting in bad faith.  So this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, but here we are.  \n\nJust to reiterate: This is not a change of policy, it is not reactive to anything that has happened in the post GME reddit environment.  We have been operating with this policy since at least 2013, probably before.  We're just seeing an absurd surge in this sort of shit so a public post was necessary.",

        "selftext": "This has been a great 2 weeks for stocks. In this time AMC led the way and showed the shorter sellers the power of retail. This week, we saw the boosts of CLOV, BB, GME, TLRY, WKHS, CLF and CLNE. One name has probably been in everyone\u2019s peripheral vision: UWMC. \n\nToday was a mixed sentiment day with many of our tickers seeing pullbacks and folks taking profit. UWMC was able to weather the storm. In a full day session, UWMC not once dip below 6% green. It held strong even as the other popular ticker experienced sell downs. The reason for this is simple: it\u2019s a GREAT company.\n\nHere are just some highlights of upcoming catalysts:\n\n1. Increasing short interest, 55% over the past few weeks. Despite the stellar performance over the last few days short interest went up.\n\n2. Resilience to short attacks. Through the day there were several obvious short attempts to pull the down the stock but UWMC recovered instantly each time. This demonstrates an enormous pool of buyers with eyes locked.\n\n3. Russell 2000 inclusion this Friday. I don\u2019t think I need to point out the obvious benefits of ETFs in this play.\n\n4. 4% Dividends will be distributed on July 6th. Many of these dividend distributions will find its way back into the stock.\n\n5. 50K share insider purchase this morning. When memes go up, insiders sell. This is Not the case with UWMC. Insiders are buying! That\u2019s how much management believes in the company.\n\n6. There\u2019s still the 300M share buyback that\u2019s taking place while we ride.\n\nGet ready boys, this will be a good one.",

        "selftext": "So I'm currently a bystander in the current GME frenzy. I have been very skeptical and I came to believe that \"it's going to go down. Hedge funds will take both sides.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems I might be in the wrong.\n\nYou know the hedge fund that was supposedly out of GME positions?\n\nYap. That 'Melvin Capital'.\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/ca1090ba-c3aa-446c-8406-7ce0e01bb510](https://www.ft.com/content/ca1090ba-c3aa-446c-8406-7ce0e01bb510)\n\n&gt;Melvin Capital and Light Street Capital, two US hedge funds hard hit by the January rally in stocks popular with retail investors, suffered further losses in May.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Melvin, the highest-profile casualty of this year\u2019s meme stock rally, lost another 4 per cent last month, people familiar with its performance said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hedge fund losses from betting against five popular meme stocks \u2014 **GameStop, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, AMC, BlackBerry and Clover Health** \u2014 total about $6bn since the start of May, according to the data firm Ortex Analytics.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Melvin Capital is currently at a 44.7 percent loss YTD while Light Street Capital is down 20.1 percent.**\n\nLooks like there are still hedge funds that actually haven't learnt. It might be the case some actually doubled tripled down again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that Mudrick Capital that took advantage of AMC shares to sell directly to the public at higher prices? Well, even with all that unfair advantage, Mudrick Capital actually came out behind of AMC.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-11/mudrick-s-amc-bet-backfires-after-meme-frenzy-wrecks-hedges?utm\\_source=google&amp;utm\\_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-11/mudrick-s-amc-bet-backfires-after-meme-frenzy-wrecks-hedges?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google)\n\n&gt;**After weeks of profiting** from the stock and debt of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management **ended up with a 5.4% loss after a derivatives bet went haywire**.\n\nYap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not your financial advisor or whatever. But it seems that there will always be shorts.\n\nLet's look at brokerages like IBKR: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\n\nDefinitely still shorted for many of these 'meme stocks'.\n\nWeird world we live in. I was a doubter but it seems:\n\n**\u201cWe can remain retards longer than they can stay solvent\u201d**\n\nhas a lot of truths behind it. At this rate, I really wonder what the actual retail ownership % of shares like AMC and GME are. I really wouldn't be surprised if the ownership shares go over (if not already is) 100%. And I wouldn't be surprised if there are some retards that just decide 'to keep throwing money every paycheck for years' if needed. After all, there's finite number of shares end of day. And these 'meme stocks' have very low market cap and is very realistic to run out of shares with the number of users in this subreddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I have no positions in GME/AMC stocks. I am just amazed after all my skepticism that there are hedge funds that still didn't do proper risk management.",

        "selftext": "There has been an interesting thing over the last few weeks where most of the posts regarding Clover Health, or Workhorse seem to mysteriously make their way off of the WSB treads.  There have been many for both companies, but particularly CLOV that have had outstanding DD with communication directly with investor relations describing and hashing out the difference between A shares and B shares to get the float numbers right, exploring Ortex and Fintel data in order to work short and holding numbers - as well as many other pieces of due diligence.\n\nWhat is up with that?\n\nI'm sure that the Mods probably have heavy bags from buying GME at $500 and AMC at $75 and are having a head time removing their wives boyfriend from the couch they would otherwise sleep on, but does that mean that solid DD on any other company should simply be removed from this forum?\n\nCLOV is likely one of the best plays for the coming month given the newfound interest in the company, the huge call volume that has been trading hands, and the short data that has come out from Ortex.\n\nSay what you want, but Chamath had this forums back in January and called the apes sophisticated investors, we might just for a moment consider the opportunity here without the mods bouncing it off of the forum any chance they get \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nCLOV to the moon!

        "selftext": "I just WISH to highlight some facts from my own analysis on why I think WISH is worth a look. I used several criterias and detailed the methodology used for each one as well as the results. Enjoy the reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Analysts Opinion**\n\n* *Methodology*: Comparing the price target of WISH as of today with some others meme names the day before they started rising (obviously those dates are subjective and my choice might differ from yours).\n* *Results:* \n   * The average price target (PT) for WISH is 18.4 (+84%) whereas meme stocks had averages below (GME, AMC) or close (BB, CLOV) to their respective PT\n   * WISH is the only stock where even the most pessimistic analyst has a PT above current price ($12 / +20%) and 0 sell recommendation\n   * Majority of analysts are positive on the stock (81.8%)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hz996cpiyt471.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6900c69c7094e8b4a74c69d20a01da22e94077e1\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\n* *Methodology:* Comparing expected price-to-sales ratios, expected revenue CAGR and expected adjusted EBITDA margin based on analyst forecasts at end of 2023. Note that the selection of meme stocks is subjective and so are the resulting averages in the table below.\n* *Results*: WISH has, by far, the smallest expected price-to-sales ratio although its expected revenue growth and EBITDA margin are only slightly below average\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5kfi4sazt471.png?width=261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef1595e4859e2447b4232d66df85109b3a905cc7\n\n**Short Interest**\n\n* *Methodology:* Comparing the short interest as a % of float of WISH, as of today, with some other meme names before they started their rise (again: dates choice are subjective). Note that I only have access to short interest information updated twice per month; therefore I sued the closest date as a reference point.\n* *Results:*\n   * WISH has a short interest ratio close to BB when it became a meme stock\n   * The lock-up period on WISH shares ended in May and its float increased from 60.6m to 376.5m shares. The ratio before the end of the lock-up was then around 45%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gwtyvsxzt471.png?width=285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116d3a72acc56d8daa289d718795ea3f683b6d66\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n* *Methodology:* Using trend lines, resistances and exponential moving averages. Note that this is highly subjective.\n* *Results*:\n   * A major downtrend line has been broken recently, which led to a furious increase towards a strong resistance at 15. $15 used to be a support until beginning of April\n   * The exponential moving average of 25 days used to act as a resistance and might now act as a support (Friday close just above it)\n   * If the downtrend is indeed broken, this pulldown would be an interesting entry point\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjhzewrj0u471.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec006afd248a8f6680725b95822c5c1094873c7b\n\n**Conclusion** *(personal and subjective)*\n\nI believe that WISH has strong attributes to become a winning meme stock: 1) an under-valued price as suggested by analyst forecasts; 2) a high short interest ratio; 3) a potential entry point based on technical analysis\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is not a financial advice or recommendation, I'm just sharing my own analysis and I highly suggest you do your own as well**\n\n*^(Source for figures and chart: Bloomberg)*",

        "selftext": " \n\nDear Apes,\n\nI believe we are in the midst of one of the greatest short squeeze set ups (analytically) in a while and here's why.\n\nPotential Catalysts:\n\n* As of Friday, the short interest of WKHS resides at damn near 45-50%; Now, a stock that has a mere 1.6 Billion in Market Capitalization with nearly half shares available selling short screams short squeeze.  \n\n   * WKHS (Data as of 6/5/21)  \n\n      * Market Cap: 1.6 Billion\n      * Short Interest: \\~45%\n      * Institutional Ownership: 45%\n      * Institutions that sold short: 106\n   * AMC (Data as of 6/5/21)  \n\n      * Market Cap: 24 Billion\n      * Short Interest: \\~21%\n      * Institutional Ownership: 26%\n      * Institutions that sold short: 104\n   * GME (Data as of 6/5/21)  \n\n      * Market Cap: \\~18 Billion\n      * Short Interest: \\~21%\n      * Institutional Ownership: \\~37%\n      * Institutions that sold short: 187\n\n(Above you can compare some of the quantitative data to see the extreme similarities between GME, AMC, and now WKHS. All have over 100 institutions selling short)\n\nMore Catalysts:\n\n* Short selling rule active this Monday (6/7); this rule implies you cannot short a stock on an uptick if said stock lost 10% from the previous trading close. WKHS closed down 11% on Friday\n* If you look at the option data I have provided, I have monitored the open interest on WKHS the previous 5 trading days (highlighted in blue); OI -1 = 1 Day previous; OI -2 = 2 Days Previous\n* As you see circled in yellow, there is extremely bullish movement at the 15 and 20 Call Strike prices; Factoring in the flow of capital into the 15 Call around 1 million, nearing 1/1000 of WKHS \\~1 Billion Market Cap; therefore quite significant, given these are derivatives with zero intrinsic value\n* Look at the chart I have included (in a 1 day chart time period) we can note the upward momentum with the MACD shifting, and TTM trend fully engaged from the first baby squeeze to 18 two days prior, volume dramatically increasing (highlighted in green) as well\n\nA little Math:\n\n* As you can see, given WKHS is small cap stock currently, like how GME and AMC began after being shorted to the dirt, with WKHS having only a \\~1 Billion cap, there is potential to double, triple, 5x this current share price of ($13/share). Given that half of the available shares are short (\\~600 million in equity), we only need roughly 200-300 million in buying pressure for a squeeze to begin. And given the fact that there are naked shorts at the 15 and 20 Call, that 200-300 million in buying pressure would bring us to that range alone, causing shorts to start covering immediately and thus a squeeze ensuing.\n\nOption Chain Analysis:\n\n* If you look at the screenshot I have provided, you can see that the volume on this previous Friday of the options with strike prices of 15 and 20 at dates (6/11 and 6/18) are greater than the actual open interest. For those of you who don't know, open interest is the current amount of contracts that are open and effectively being sold short (Available shares x100). Since the volume of the current day is greater than the open interest this implies that the contracts were written on Friday (since open interest is always updated the following trading day)\n\nBriefing for those unfamiliar with WKHS:\n\n* A renewable, electric delivery/drone, innovative company who was in competition to receive a bid for a 6 billion dollar USPS contract to supply a large quantity of vehicles. Unfortunately, the bid was lost earlier this year and has been aggressively shorted since.\n* This is an American born, American made company.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\n(repost because automod ... probably)\n\n(tldr at the end)\n\nfirst of all:\n\n* this is not a \"bring the hedges down all GME\" Post.\n* Its just about making some quick bucks in a short amount of time.\n\nOkay let's go.\n\nFirst  of all as you probably know $WKHS is one (if not the) most shorted  stock on Wall Street. Tbh I dont care about that much, but its surely a  good thing to know.\n\nFacts:\n\nWKHS (Workhorse ( [https://workhorse.com/](https://workhorse.com/) )) is a delivery tech company.\n\nThey manufacture the cars and drones for delivery companys.\n\nTheir fleet only contains 100% electric cars with moderate range and deluvery drones.\n\n&gt;Workhorse is a technology company focused on providing drone-integrated electric vehicles to the last-mile delivery sector\n\nfinacials:\n\nthey have 200mil in cash so they have some money left to invest.\n\nSales  for the first quarter of 2021 were recorded at approximately  $521,000  compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020 (an  incerase of 620% within a year)\n\ntechnicals:\n\n**24h CHART**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60uxquh96h471.png?width=1760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b98b10bdd40b7bc3697c6cf97fef350f218f6ea4\n\nAs you can see there was a sharp selloff after they didnt get a contract with USPS.\n\nThe  good thing we see here is that we are in the old channel between \\~15$  and \\~30$ + the selloff happend so rapidly that from 15 to 30$ there is  not mayor resistance except \\~18$.\n\n\\+ Heavy support on 15$ since last year\n\n**4h CHART**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/no1cu2ua6h471.png?width=1757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b242da9eb3dc2bea4142b0fe605addb124fd7846\n\nso what that means is that on a way of a nearly 100% increase the is only one mayor resistance.\n\n**3min CHART**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kxjcnrb6h471.png?width=1643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4201b72f10a9988de8c93c38c952a20cf5d60542\n\nWe are probably right in the beginning of a 100% increase in the next coming weeks.\n\nWe are literally at the biggest support line of this stock right now in this moment.\n\nTactics:\n\nBecause  this stock is extreme volatile I will go with stocks only this time.  average buy is at \\~16$ (bought 500 at 17$ and 500 near 15$)\n\nwill  hold 50% of my stocks until we reach 30$, after that I see what happens  next (probably ist goes even further or I sell if it goes down to 25$).\n\nTL;DR\n\n* highly shortet stock with good money managment and a good looking future\n* a possible increase of 100% in the next 2-5 weeks.\n* literally at the bottom\n\nbuy now, price target is 30$",

        "selftext": "Great news for retail. Now the hedge funds can\u2019t keep adding to their position at higher prices to avoid getting margin called. \n\n&gt;Wall Street\u2019s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders\u2019 most-popular meme stocks.\n\n&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, according to people familiar with the moves. The banks are trying to protect themselves against fallout from extreme surges and dips that have characterized trading in companies including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., MicroVision Inc. and GameStop Corp.\n\n&gt;The changes mean some hedge funds and other institutional investors now face higher collateral requirements or are limited from shorting certain stocks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal policy decisions.\n\n&gt;Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options\u201d in GameStop, AMC and MicroVision, the firm said in a memo to clients seen by Bloomberg News.

Both  amc and gme  will explode in a crash due to them having a negative beta , and negative beta stocks tend to do the opposite of the market , with the amount of volume we are seeing with amc we could see amc sky rocket and if that happens that will 100 percent cause hedge funds to cover their shorts , now with that being said do ur own DD but I believe holding amc or gme can save u from getting fuvked in a crash as this is the easiest money u will ever make , thank me later",
