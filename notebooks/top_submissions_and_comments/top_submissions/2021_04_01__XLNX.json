        "selftext": " See my previous AMD DDs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd\\_increasing\\_production\\_by\\_20\\_in\\_q2\\_buy\\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd_increasing_production_by_20_in_q2_buy_before/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the\\_amd\\_boom\\_is\\_still\\_coming\\_heres\\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the_amd_boom_is_still_coming_heres_why/)\n\nEverything there came true, except the stock is down today. Why? Well take a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means they need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases. Analysts are already saying to buy, and buy aggressively at this price.\n\nI know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  \n\"This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.\"\n\nOne could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% QoQ which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales QoQ saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.\n\nOne could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.\n\nOne could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.\n\nAll of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.\n\nWith AMD, there's no need for individual investors to try to turn it around on the short sells, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.\n\nAMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022.",

        "selftext": " \n\nOk Monkeys here is a short dd ( will make a more more detailed one if there is interest, let me know below)\n\nAMD   sells chips to a variety of sectors but you can mainly categorize it   into to two sectors: Computing&amp;Graphics and Enterprise ( Embedded   and Semi-Custom). Basically if there is a need for calculations they   make the chips.  As you might have noticed there has been a supply   shortage lately causing semi conductors prices to sky rocket- if you  have been trying to buy on lately you will know. So AMD is a part of a  mega trend and there is a clip of the psycho CEO mama who has been on Sir   hithouse aka Cramer telling him it is good for business ( cant post the video but you can google \"AMD CEO gives update on Xilinx acquisition and talks chip shortage impact\")  \n\n\nThe   CEO mama Su is nothing short of a genius. PhD in electro engineering   from MIT she has been running the show since 2014 where AMD was a mess. I   shall not go into the accounting details but basically she knows her   stuff and this the development of the stock price reflects just that\n\nFrom 4 dlls a share to now be around 80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7vgzaaq2xu61.png?width=1421&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7c706926ec908bba980ad9b7cad7f9c93cb77e3\n\nIntel   came out yesterday with a great earnings report but more or less   explicitly saying they are losing market share despite the market is hit   by a supply shock. AMD will report on Tuesday and if you fancy a bet   you can buy calls for that or you can just like the stock, or if you   feel adventurous buy LEAPS.\n\nWhatever   the case AMD looks to be a long term winner with the best products,   best management in a sector that will thrive going forward. I dont   really consider it a long term risk and i hold it and have done so for   quite sometime",

Why? Well take a look at the short interest:  \n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AMD/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AMD/short-interest/)  \nAMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means hedge funds need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit or else they'll have to cover. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases. Analysts are already saying to buy, and buy aggressively at this price.\n\nOne could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% QoQ which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales QoQ saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.\n\nOne could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it. \n\nOne could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.\n\nAll of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year. \n\nWith GME, it was over shorted and WSB turned it around all on their own. With AMD, there's no need for WSB or individual investors to try to turn it around on the short selling hedge funds, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, diamond hands, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.\n\nAMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022. My price target is $120. Though a short squeeze would send it to $200.",

I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day.
