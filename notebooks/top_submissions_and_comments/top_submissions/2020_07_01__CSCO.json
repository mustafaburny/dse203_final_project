        "selftext": "Every now and then, a pennystock comes around that makes you think: How the hell is this a pennystock? How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology. (see below for a few examples)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey are the preferred OEM for Nvidia:\n\n[OSS Introduces the World's First and only PCIe 4.0 Expansion System for Nvidia.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oss-introduces-world-first-pcie-150010777.html)\n\n[OSS and Nvidia](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus)\n\n[Official PR from NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/worlds-top-system-makers-unveil-nvidia-a100-powered-servers-to-accelerate-ai-data-science-and-scientific-computing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nU.S. Military Defense:\n\n[OSS Military Defense, Navy, Air, and Ground forces.](https://www.onestopsystems.com/defense)\n\n[Latest Order from U.S. Navy](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/163/oss-orders-for-new-u-s-navy-ai-threat-detection-system-top)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAI Learning, DLSS, and Self-driving vehicles:\n\n[OSS Reveals World's First Solution for AI Learning that incorporates NVIDIA GPUs and ARM-based servers.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/19/1949447/0/en/OSS-Introduces-Industry-s-First-Solution-Incorporating-NVIDIA-GPUs-with-NVLink-and-Marvell-ThunderX2-Arm-based-Servers.html)\n\n[OSS AI on the Fly](https://www.onestopsystems.com/ai-on-the-fly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMachine Learning:[ OSS Machine Learning Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/machine-learning)\n\nMedical:[ OSS Medical Pre-built Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/medical)\n\nOil Industry:[ OSS Oil and Gas Industry Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/oil-and-gas)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are about a hundred more links, presentations, and conference calls that could be added to this post, but it would simply make it too long. *(We will be releasing follow up posts throughout the week to break up the information.)*\n\n$2 for a pennystock generating $60 million of revenue in its second year?\n\n$2 for a company that literally dominates an entire section of its industry?\n\n$2 for a company that is partnered with over 50+ major companies?\n\n$2 for a company that literally makes DOUBLE its ENTIRE MARKET CAP?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Vanguard increases their holdings by 103%, something's up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Further in-depth analysis will be posted tomorrow and throughout the week.)*\n\nA few of the topics to be covered are: product and competitor assessment, corporate presentations/conference calls, and financial breakdown.

The Partnerships mixed with the company's primary direction at this point should put them closer to their price target much sooner than anticipated with even a chance of bypassing by Aug-Sep. This will not only be massive for schools but will be used across all applications of daily life moving forward. \n\n*sorry I don't have more time to put into this but I am occupied with my son being sick at the moment* (he's fine)",

So here\u2019s the plan, DYNATRACE, the blue balls of cloud stocks. Here\u2019s a company with a massive nut sack, teaming with potential and ready to explode like all his friends. I\u2019ve been touching it for a while but I need help getting it to pop. Main competitors are DDOG, Splunk and lastly cisco but they\u2019re huge and gay, so ignore. Here\u2019s some numbers for the nerds out there:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDT Earnings:\n\nMarket Cap: 11B\n\nActual Revenue $150.60m \n\nEstimated $146.31m\n\nActual Eps $.11\n\nEstimated $.08\n\nOperating income 8.03m\n\nCost of revenue 27.31m\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDDOG:\n\nMarket Cap: 26B\n\nActual Revenue $131.30m\n\nEstimated $117.73m\n\nActual Eps $.06\n\nEstimated $.03\n\nOperating income 3.78m\n\nCost of revenue 26.48m\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPLK :\n\nMarket Cap: 31.94b\n\nActual Revenue $434b\n\nEstimated $443b \n\nActual Eps $-.56\n\nEstimated $-.57\n\nOperating income -288.61M\n\nCost of revenue 128.62M\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven a freckled up red head at the beach can tell you that DT should have a higher market cap than datadog. DT earned more tinders with the the same capital. DT also doubled the dogs operating income. Fuck DDOG. Now check out at Splunk, great name but she\u2019s losing money faster than my puts in April. Fuck Splunk\n\nRecap: DT is profitable and Jizzing with potential\n\nDT 11/20 $45 All in",

        "selftext": "*Markets take the stairs up and the window down*,\n\nAs we've been warning over the past week, the NASDAQ got hit yesterday and many of the leaders were off by 3%+. This could be the part of a larger sell-the-news event into next week as great results expected from AMZN, FB, GOOGL, and AAPL earnings are likely already priced into the pie.\n\nTo me, this is part of a larger sense of uncertainty across multiple fronts that might just produce a continued sideways reaction into November and beyond. Anything can happen, and we won't stay married to that read if things change, as they always do.\n\n[But Cisco Systems (CSCO) is acting like an old Clydesdale by actually rallying yesterday in the midst of the bloodshed](https://i.imgur.com/mzEPoUU.png). CSCO pays a 3% dividend and is showing a huge coiling move into their 12AUG earnings date; looks like the price is starting to break early to a measured-move target of $52. An entry at $47.50 has a $4.50 upside profit target/share and a stop at $44/share, giving you a slight edge in reward-to-risk.\n\nThis gap of $3.50 between the entry price and the stop represents your \"risk,\" which needs to be sized to no more than 1-2% of your account value. For example, if you traded a ten share position, then your aggregate risk would be $35. This represents a 2% risk position for an $1750 account.\n\nAlternatively, a more efficient way to trade this breakout in a limited-risk fashion is with CSCO vertical spreads using the 28AUG series with the 47.5/48.5 strike prices, where you can limit the risk/contract to no more than $50/contract. Be aware of the 8/12 earnings date and try to clear the position prior to that.\n\nI post these daily trades first over on /r/tradeoftheday , so come join us and post your own trades!\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nCheers and beers,\n\nReadySetTrade",
