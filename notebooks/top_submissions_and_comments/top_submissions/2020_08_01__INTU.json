        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

The S&amp;P closed 1.01% higher and the NASDAQ 0.6%. The Dow also rose, ending the day 1.39% up.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

        "selftext": "  \n\nI was introduced to options in 2005. \n\nA co-worker of mine, who happened to be a 9/11 Truther before that was a term, was all hyped up on the upcoming ER for Amgen. He went around the office on a manic high, telling everyone to buy short term OTM call options - or as we refer to them around these parts, FDs. \n\nAs part of our retirement plans, we each had Fidelity brokerage accounts. To enable options trading, however, you had to call Fidelity and answer questions about your level of financial smarts and how much money you had. The correct answers were, of course \"genius level\" and \"shitloads.\" I answered truthfully. My other coworkers did not. They got to options trading enabled. I did not.\n\nAmgen beat and some of these guys landed 8 baggers. My own officemate made $50k and promptly took his family to Disneyland. As you can imagine, I was dismayed that I missed out.\n\nFor the next few months, chasing the next big trade was all the rage, and our team could hardly get anything done. I got my account upgraded by answering the questions correctly, but every play the group made after Amgen was a loser. Because I never had that thrill of victory, I quickly lost interest, but the temptation to recapture those initial gains captivated some of the other guys. As the losses racked up, the trading group got smaller and smaller, eventually distilling down to the most degenerate off talking in the corner, the crazy Truther mumbling his false prophesies to his last few disciples. I lost about $1000 \u2013 which was no small change at that time in my life \u2013 but I know that some of the guys lost a lot more chasing that high.\n\nThat\u2019s still better than the snake oil the retail investment crowd is selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor any market at any given time, Boggleheads and r/investing will tell you to just keep putting money in, no matter how badly you are getting fucked.\n\n*\u201c7% YoY in the market!\u201d* \n\n*\u201cThe greatest force in the universe is compound interest!\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you hold for the long term, you don\u2019t have to worry about volatility!\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the cold truth: the life advice Boomers give out is fucking outdated, designed for an analog world created by a Greatest Generation that coddled them, and that includes their financial advice as well.\n\nI am from the \u201c[Oregon Trail Generation](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/)\u201d, the last slice of GenX that actually grew up with computers. We are the cohort that witnessed the death of the American Middle Class that the Internet Age and Globalization, entering the workforce just as the dot-com bubble finally put it out of its misery.\n\nWhen I was 3, my grandfather retired from Boeing after 35 years. They gave him a platinum plated set of draftsman\u2019s tools, a brass desk clock and a lifelong pension.\n\nWhen I was 19, my girlfriend\u2019s dad was a consultant for Boeing. His job was to dig up dirt on upcoming retirees so they could be fired to deprive them of that pension.\n\nI did the *thing,* that good old American Dream \u2013 marriage, house, car, kids. I did what the \u201cexperts\u201d tell you to do: save a slice of each paycheck for retirement, invest in a college plan, buy a house as a solid investment. \n\nHere I am barely middle-aged, and I have worked through three major financial crises since I entered the workforce.\n\nI\u2019ve chased a runaway housing market, lowering my parameters every month because the prices kept rising faster than I could make for a down payment.\n\nTwice, I have had my retirement account fleeced, then had to draw down what was left to keep a roof over my head - paying a penalty to do so. \n\nI have been so upside down on a mortgage I\u2019ve considered burning the house down.\n\nSo I am here to tell you firsthand that *Save, Buy, Hold and Diversify* will not help you when the whole market collapses and you find yourself in need of that money, that a house is just an investment that you can live in while it drops in value, and that *Dollar Cost Averaging* is another way of saying *Getting Cucked.*\n\nI say, if you are going to make or lose 50% in the next 10 years, you may as well make or lose that 50% in the next 10 *hours.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, younger Millennials and Zoomers are better equipped to face these facts than us older folks. If you came of age during the GFC or later, you understand that the game is rigged. All that bailout money is moving around the market while you are struggling to make minimum wage in the Uber Eats gig economy. Unlike those of us who grew up in more stable times, you know in your bones the halcyon days - the ones you've only ever heard about - about are never coming back. \n\nNot for everybody, at any rate.\n\nSo enters RobinHood, and it drives the financial pundits absolutely berserk. Who are these fucking kids YOLOing on HTZ? Don\u2019t they know they are supposed to be investing that money into a passive index fund, or even better, one of those retirement-date funds with the massive expense ratios? It\u2019s fucking up the game for the rest of us! \n\nI have traded options on and off for years in the hopes of making a little pocket money. Fact is, when commissions were $8-$20 per trade (plus a fee per contract), there was no way a small-time retail investor could participate meaningfully. With free or no commissions, the calculus has changed, lowering the bar of entry for smaller investors who can enter and exit a position at any time with only the bid-ask spread the main concern.\n\nBoomers created a monster, and they have only themselves to blame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, when March hit, I jumped in to puts and lost a bunch of money. This is because I was using an old way of thinking about options, the only one available to small-time retail traders just a few years ago: \u201cI hope that this security makes a huge break in a particular direction.\u201d \n\nAfter this loss and subsequent reflection, I determined that the money was there to be had, just that I was taking the wrong approach. I developed a new strategy, one that takes advantage of the simple fact that I can enter and exit a position without significant commission costs. I began to diversify my targets, and enter smaller positions on those targets, so that I didn\u2019t have everything riding on one or two plays. I developed exit strategies - and followed them! \u2013 so that I could take my wins or cut my losses quickly and move on to the next trade. \n\nAnd most importantly, I made it a point to withdraw my gains, if any, at the end of every week.\n\nSince April, I have executed no less than 20 trades per week if you count option expiry. In 15 weeks, I have doubled my account value. Not because of some one-off spectacular play or because I\u2019ve been a bull a bull market. In fact, I\u2019m a bear, but using a pretty neutral strategy. I doubled my money because I adapted to this new trading climate, found what works for me, and simply stuck to it.\n\nDo I think that makes me some some sort of fucking genius? Absolutely not. I\u2019ve made some smart, conservative plays that turned really goddamned sour. I\u2019ve made some truly retarded plays that turned out great. I\u2019ve had good weeks, bad weeks, and weeks that amounted to an incredibly stressful waste of time. I still make a bunch of mistakes - weekly, if not daily. \n\nI am still prepared \u2013 waiting, even \u2013 for my whole account to get wiped out due to a cacophony of bad plays. In the end, these are all gut decisions. Do I feel good about this? For each of them, only time reveals if I am right.\n\nBut if I have taken one thing away from what I have learned so far this year, it is this: *anybody can make rent money in the equities market now*. You do not have to have a massive account to overcome the burden of commissions, or have a huge investment in dividend stocks to realize a gains-based income. And thank God for that, because the job market is not going to save you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the gain porn here is enough to make a man drool, and the loss porn is enough to make his balls retract into his stomach. Just understand those are always one-sided directional plays. It\u2019s all-in on a single ticker, a true YOLO, not unlike putting it on black at the roulette table. It\u2019s easy to get caught up looking at the massive gains and get stars in your eyes.\n\nBut forget the lambo and the gold-plated yacht for a moment and consider something more immediate, such as: \u201ccould I pay this month\u2019s phone bill with my gains?\u201d With the money you can pare off into a brokerage account, is it possible to avoid spending the the money you make doing whatever it is you do for someone else and make your phone service \u201cfree\u201d?\n\nFor example, if you have $1000 and you make a reasonably conservative play with an exit strategy of $100 gain and $100 loss (such as a deep OTM 45DTE bull credit spread on a decent stock that\u2019s been beaten up recently, with a hard exit 21DTE), the likelihood is very high. It is not guaranteed \u2013 you may end up down $100 from where you started. But what *is* guaranteed is that you will have to spend 8 hours flipping burgers or whatever at $12.50 an hour to make that $100 if you don't. (Yes, I know, *taxes \u2013* the point still stands).\n\nWhen you finally get to take that $100 out and pay the phone bill with it, it becomes very, very real. \n\nImagine getting to a point where your trading gains pay for the things you *need*, so you can spend the money you earn with your blood sweat and tears on the things you *want.*\n\nThis is what it means to have a \u201cS.M.A.R.T.\u201d goal \u2013 small, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. When you conform your efforts to translate into something small yet meaningful to your life, it changes the perspective.\n\nBut even if you decide to take your bi-weekly retirement contribution and YOLO it on MU FDs, you\u2019ve got just as much of a chance of coming ahead with that as you do giving it to Mr. Market to hold for the next 20 years.\n\nBoomers will tell you \u201cmost day traders lose money!\u201d First, \u201cday trader\u201d is a specific term. But that aside, it is also true most businesses fail in the first year. In both cases, people get burned, give up and go back to what they know. They fail to plan, they fail to learn from experience, and they fail to persevere. \n\nThis is not an appeal to \u201cnot be average\u201d nor to keep \u201cchasing bad money with good\u201d - just to keep trying. Set your goals, manage your risk, hone your successes, and learn from your failures.\n\nAt no other time in history has it been possible for the average Joe to participate in the equities market with so little friction as commission-free mobile trading, and with so much leverage as weekly options. I know, because I\u2019m old enough to remember when stock quotes were in the weekly paper, and they were registered in one-eighths of a dollar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR; T**o Hell with the haters like Cramer and his ilk. Keep learning and growing and trying to rake in tendies. The lambo isn\u2019t the goal - *financial freedom* is. An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain\u2019t gonna get you there. We live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth, and you have the right \u2013 the obligation, even - to participate. Go get your fucking slice.\n\nI love you retards.",

That's something I'm interested in.\n\nNow, here is the D^(aily)D^(ick) you all degenerates have all been fiending for:  \n*Fundamentally*:  \n[Pure Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage) remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double-digits, yet remains constantly cucked and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21\n\nThe 36 Months beta value for PSTG stock is at 1.62.   \n74% Buy Rating on RH.   \nPSTG has a short float of 7.28% and public float of 243.36M with average trading volume of 3.16M shares. This was trading at around $18 on Wednesday 8/5 when I started writing this and as of right now, it's about $17.33. \n\nThe company has a market capitalization of \\~$4.6 billion. In the last quarter, PSTG reported a ballin'-ass profit of $256.82 million. Pure Storage also saw revenues increase to $367.12 million. As of 04-2020, they got cash money flowing at $11.32 million . The company\u2019s EBITDA came in at -$62.81 million which compares very fucking well among its dinosaur ass peers like HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp. Pure Storage keeps taking market share from them old farts while growing the chad-like revenues of 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21. \n\nChart of their financial growth since IPO in 2015:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7\n\nAt the end of last quarter, Pure Storage had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.274B, compared with $1.299B as of Feb 2, 2020. The total Debt to Equity ratio for PSTG is recording at 0.64 and as of 8/6, Long term Debt to Equity ratio is at 0.64.   \nEarning highlights from last quarter:\n\n* Revenue $367.1 million, up 12% year-over-year\n* **Subscription Services revenue** $120.2 million, up 37% year-over-year\n* GAAP gross margin 70.0%; non-GAAP gross margin 71.9%\n* GAAP operating loss $(84.9) million; non-GAAP operating loss $(5.4) million\n* Operating cash flow was $35.1 million, up $28.5 million year-over-year\n* Free cash flow was $11.3 million, up $29.0 million year-over-year\n* Total cash and investments of $1.3 billion\n\nI bolded the Subscription Services Revenue bullet because to me that's a big deal. Pure Storage keeps them coming back with products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store and everybody knows that the recurring revenue model is best model. Big ass enterprises buy storage from vendors such as Pure Storage in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers. $$$\n\nWhat are Pure Storage's other revenue drivers? Well these motherfuckers also have the products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01su6chrwnf51.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e6a705f9392291bc0c3932c815802d9101365e\n\nSo far, it seems like Pure Storage's smart ass [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHE7X5Gt71o) has been spot on with his prediction of the flash storage sector's direction. Pure Storage's \"Pure-as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store\" unified subscription offerings is fo sho gaining momentum it. This shit is catching on with enterprises, both big and small. COVID-19 increased the acceleration of our digital transformation and our subsequent shift to the cloud. The increased demand in data-centers is going to drastically help Pure Storage's future top and bottom line and to top it off, **NAND prices are recovering** (inferred from MU earnings). I expect Pure Storage to get some relief on the pricing front because of this which obviously in turn should improve revenues. \n\nPSTG's numbers look pretty good to me so far but are they a good company overall? Even when scalping and trading, I don't like to fuck with overall shitty companies so I always check for basic things like customer satisfaction, analyst ratings/targets, broad-view industry trends, and hedge fund positioning.. that sort of thing.   \n**Pure Storage stands out in all of these fields for me.**   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4n0e5nve5of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=495416bb6f5a2dab77f3ac483ca4d9510b39037c\n\nCustomers like Dominos Pizza and many others all seem to be happy AF with no issues. I can hardly even find a negative review online. The products seems to be universally applauded. Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider Pure Storage's product line-up some of the best in the industry. \n\nThe industry average for this sector is a piss poor 65.  \nPure Storage has a 2020 Net Promoter Score of [86](https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/pure-storage)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w51io8yvmf51.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f7d06825d0ad9d126216e5069af2f9c3636f86a\n\nEnterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and modern data arrays that are based on NAND flash because they're forced to keep up with the increasing speed of the future of business inter-connectivity. This isn't changing because of the pandemic and this isn't changing in the future.. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled like the fat fucks at IBM need to be. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than the old school storage vendors like bitchass NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM. \n\nPure Storage\u2019s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year - LIKE A PROPER HIGH GROWTH COMPANY.   \nHPE, NetApp and IBM, like the losers they are, lost market share.   \nAccording to [blocksandfiles.com](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/07/03/gartner-all-flash-array-revenues-q12020/), AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:\n\n* \u201cDell EMC \u2013 34.8% (calculated $766m) vs. 33.7% a year ago\n* NetApp \u2013 19.3% at $425m vs. 26.7% a year ago\n* Pure Storage \u2013 12.7% at calculated $279.7m vs. 10.1% a year ago\n* HPE \u2013 8.4% \u2013 $185m vs. 10% a year ago\"\n\nPure has been gaining share almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as the following chart shows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5agj17gcgnf51.png?width=428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9c6389baccab85261d6e0f71b3474e84b90d3c\n\n**Hedge Funds are on this like flies on shit.** \n\nAlliancebernstein L.P. grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.5% in the 4th quarter. Alliancebernstein L.P. now owns 104,390 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $1,786,000 after purchasing an additional 560 shares during the last quarter. \n\nLegal &amp; General Group Plc grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.3% in the 1st quarter. Legal &amp; General Group Plc now owns 258,791 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $3,213,000 after purchasing an additional 753 shares during the last quarter. \n\nSunbelt Securities Inc. acquired a new stake in Pure Storage in the 4th quarter worth $4,106,000. \n\nCENTRAL TRUST Co grew its position in Pure Storage by 79.8% in the 2nd quarter. CENTRAL TRUST Co now owns 3,226 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $56,000 after purchasing an additional 1,432 shares during the last quarter. \n\nNorthwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. grew its position in Pure Storage by 203.0% in the 1st quarter. Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. now owns 2,312 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $28,000 after purchasing an additional 1,549 shares during the last quarter. \n\nAlso, everybody's favorite wall street TSLA bull, **Cathie Wood** has been busy steadily purchasing big lots of PSTG for her ARK ETF funds for a while now...Even going as far as selling TSLA in order to re-balance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjxuakjosnf51.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f34abdd3b35791eb207d31d72ea0f6fb11beec30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkf1uzb2tmf51.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9870ec41cfb4ce468ba61d83f2f8a4151927a4e\n\n**Hedge funds and other institutional investors own 78.93% of the company\u2019s stock and it seems like more are piling in every day.** \n\nTons of active options, too -Pretty good volume lately with the spreads looking *decent*.\n\nOver 5,000 September $20 Calls added just on 8/3 alone \ud83e\udd14 \n\nOrder flow helps my thesis here, showing a recent influx of big dick money moving into PSTG.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/liychuhblnf51.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca6a60d54a9eb8bd9e32e0ef70992b8282c29e70\n\nGoogle Search Trends showing uptick in interest:  ^(SPY420 baby)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/joo0b9wxinf51.png?width=1710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24eb18f18be18b9b771ff1911c09c5479ba2f1a0\n\nRobinhood Trends showing the YOLO is trending up\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gk5yjdxmnf51.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c4b114c133c493c84386d1705f85229f5f7d44\n\nIncreased job postings on LinkedIn all across the globe, further supporting the idea that Pure Cloud Adoption is looking strong. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zenasprznf51.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a492e227e2208fe89925c9b7fe365634f7ffde6a\n\n*Technically*:  \nThis broke out through down-trend line a couple of days ago and as of right now looks to be pretty oversold. Looks like its found support at the 50 DMA and zooming out , the chart just looks like to me that it's coiling up for a big breakout. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxtz8minmnf51.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7baabbd3e8f97dfc8bd0d5bfa512613c2eea4921\n\nThese fucking shorts are going to get squeezed out hard. Potential short squeeze coming?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lh8lp08funf51.png?width=1533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=921b6684369e25e94f00ed96a404458028e540c8\n\n**So what's the play?**  \nI'd like to see RSI break out of the downtrend and the divergence between price &amp; momentum ends at some point. If/when RSI breaks out, I want to play this thing aggressively with bullish call calendar spreads....THAT IS IF I HAD SOME FUCKING BUYING POWER (FUCK YOU UBER)....  \nSoooo really what I'll be doing is asking my wife's boyfriend sometime this weekend for a loan. That way on Monday I can buy some **$PSTG 9/18 $17.5 &amp; $20 calls** at open and YOLO my saddness away for a week.  \nGod forbid, I might even buy of those things called \"shares\" I heard about from /r/investing if at all possible because in all honesty, I really do feel like this is a good company to hold in a long term growth portfolio.  \nPure Storage is NOT looking like your average KODK prostitute to flip or scalp and actually more like someone you'd bring home to your 2 dads.   \n**EARNING DATE: 8/25**\n\nPure Storage has a history of beating estimates and rocketing up. Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply fuck-ups at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business...but then again NAND prices look to be recovering now if MU's earning isn't fucking with us and telling us fibs. Big money is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a disrespectful ass penny....Fuck that conservative ass guidance! I think PSTG is going to blow that shit out the water.  \nThis chart shows Pure Storage\u2019s past performance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4xflpezdhnf51.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1660a80a1a1821ef8098791a8cee632e25f1445\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fuen3n65of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9737a8d2c2a04163f447cf6d0ee287b40235868e\n\nMy Prediction: After ER on **8/25**, Pure Storage will hit new 52 week highs.   \n$20.50  - $23.50 is my guess. Bold prediction, $27.50+ by the EOY and $50 by December 2021.  \n\n\ntldr: **PSTG 9/18 $17.5 &amp; $20 calls**",

You could've exited anytime on Friday for a profit except the last 15 mins of trading.  AAPL stock split enthusiasm and tiktok buyout rumors by MSFT(now canned) drove it past 325 eclipsing the stimulus paycheck pause\n\nLooking into next week, again for the SPY we need to think in terms of Geopolitik Say AMZN struck a deal in South Asia and MENA regions, they're set to dominate the ecommerce market there, oh just one problem. all the goods from vietnam / US can't get there because the South China Sea is being blockaded. Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages. Whoops won't matter if they are banned in Asia due to US loosing allies over there. Tiktok case is the reverse example of this.\n\nWho makes the most money ultimately comes down to who have MORE GUNS(and wins wars),  we will see how this play out over the next few months along with the rona pandemic.

That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.  Operating internationally is like operating in a jungle in which there is survival of the fittest and most anything goes.  That is what makes having a strong military so important.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where the US Is in Its Big Cycle The stats seem to suggest that the US is roughly 75% through that cycle, +/- 10%.
