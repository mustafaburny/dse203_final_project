        "selftext": "Corona\\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.\n\nFor those who don\\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.\n\nThe main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) \n\nThe perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)\n2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.\n3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . \n4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.\n\nTo recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID \n\nI have my retarded position 80x 150c mid June",

        "selftext": "###**Abbreviation Index:**\n\nBB -- Blackberry\n\nAWS -- Amazon Web Services\n\nIVY -- Intelligent Vehicles Yo.

The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--&gt; This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents.

Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--&gt; Very technical.

It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&amp;LangLocaleID=1033&amp;Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions. I am not a financial advisor nor a professional. I own 14k shares in Blackberry, as well as options (10x 8/17/21 20c BB). Do your own DD and fact check me as well*",

        "selftext": "In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term\n\n\\~Very Long Post\\~ \\[Do NOT Read if you don't like comprehensive analysis\\]\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies. They are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, these are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good financials, with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:\n\n1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.\n2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&amp;P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&amp;P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the \"value\" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)\n3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine \"quality\" and \"value\" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&amp;P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!\n4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to \"Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.\"  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year!\n5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!\n6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.\n7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.\n8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH &amp; TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&amp;P 500 upside during \"normal\" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.\n9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.\n10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.\n\nok, here's a bonus #11:\n\n11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

        "selftext": "Hello fellow retards\n\nI know these are difficult times for this sub and it\u2019s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.\n\nInstead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.\n\nThe following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn\u2019t my native language. I will try my best.\n\n**Palantir as a Company \u2013 the beginnings**\n\nPLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this \u2013 Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government\u2026.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.\n\nYou retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji\u2019s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the DD\n\nFirst of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **1. The Management**\n\nBefore I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won\u2019t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**\n\nBefore we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don\u2019t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don\u2019t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers\u2019 base isn\u2019t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That\u2019s the reason why their products aren\u2019t so tangible for many people.\n\nPLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn\u2019t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called \u201cGraham\u201d and \u201cFoundry\u201d You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:\n\nFirst example is Syria with Graham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the \u201crest of the world\u201d for you. But this wasn\u2019t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information\u2019s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.\n\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)\n\nActually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.\n\nIn their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way\n\n\u201cGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.\u201d\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)\n\nThe second example is about \u201cFoundry\u201d and it\u2019s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)\n\n\u201cAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.\u201d\n\nBoth of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the \u201cmachine\u201d with data.\n\nThe key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**\n\nPeter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)\n\nBut this didn\u2019t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like \u201elook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions\u201c. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn\u2019t get the contracts. This was also the \u201eswamp \u201etrump was talking about.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html)\n\nA fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.\n\n*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*\n\n[https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software)\n\nEven with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn\u2019t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.\n\n[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)\n\n[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)\n\nHow it\u2019s ended? Well Peter\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and \u201ebest practices \u201ein the government\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/)\n\nPLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **4. Valuation problems**\n\nI could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it\u2019s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It\u2019s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn\u2019t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.\n\nNow back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.\n\nPLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)\n\nMorgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.\n\nThese guys are very focused on numbers and I know it\u2019s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can\u2019t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.\n\nThis ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)\n\nHow is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don\u2019t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don\u2019t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don\u2019t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That\u2019s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn\u2019t happened yet. That\u2019s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.\n\nGuys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn\u2019t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.\n\nLook at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I\u2019m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash\u2026\n\nOn page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.\n\nPLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it\u2019s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don\u2019t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **5. Risks for PLTR**\n\nDespite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: \u201cWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\u201d The S1 Form didn\u2019t aged well. Actually I don\u2019t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.\n\nAs PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn\u2019t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.\n\nI think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.\n\nThere are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can\u2019t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It\u2019s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.\n\nThe risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren\u2019t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn\u2019t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)\n\nBut even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000\u00a7. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**\n\nIf you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let\u2019s connect the dots and bring this information to a point\n\n1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!\n2. Military expenditures rising worldwide\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2\n\n[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)\n\nWith Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.\n\n3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don\u2019t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don\u2019t work with it but big Institutions does.\n\nHere is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:\n\n\u201cThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public \u2014 fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars \u2014 will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.\u201d\n\n4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don\u2019t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.\n\nFacebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn\u2019t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.\n\nA remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don\u2019t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before\u2026.\n\nPLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.\n\n5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It\u2019s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I\u2019m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don\u2019t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.\n\nI have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.\n\nIf all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..\n\n**What\u2019s next?**\n\nNow we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.\n\nFor the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.\n\nThe second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don\u2019t got the GM deal? The stock tanked \u2013 for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.\n\nBut in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don\u2019t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.\n\nI would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3\u00df. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don\u2019t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid \u2013 long term.\n\nWhat does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don\u2019t do any market activity based on my DD. I\u2019m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.\n\nMy hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized \u201cthe pumpers\u201d. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don\u2019t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.\n\nI\u2019m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!\n\nLeave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!",

Most well-structured conservative portfolios lost one-half of their value. Momentum stocks lost 80 - 95% of their value.\n\n\n\nStock Funds See Biggest Inflows Ever as BofA Warns Top Is Near\n\n\nBofA\u2019s gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull &amp; Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn\u2019t been set off since January 2018, according to the note.\n\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/stock-funds-see-biggest-inflows-ever-as-bofa-warns-top-is-near\n\nFed to test bank ability to withstand 55% fall in equity price\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/a262314b-f518-4e69-8db4-fa88b6729aab\n\nFed knows of the inflation spike and they will have to react\n\n\n\nS&amp;P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio\n\nIn Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller\u2019s book Irrational Exuberance, he introduced a price/earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 that averages inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior ten year. Today\u2019s Shiller P/E multiples are the highest they have been in two decades. \n\nDot com bubble: 44\nToday: 35 \n\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices.\n\nThe current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. \"If the ratio approaches 200%\u2014as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000\u2014you are playing with fire,\" said Buffett.\n\nCurrent Buffet Indicator: 195%\nDot com bubble Indicator: 159%\n\n\nMargin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion\u2014nearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000.

        "selftext": "AMD has ultra strong fundamentals for $120 (currently in the 80s), their main competitor has been proven to be falsifying benchmarks, and not a single gamer/modder is using an Intel chip right now. NVidia are moving into new markets, but come on...... I don't understand the loss. I only play long (except for small amounts in fun stocks), so I'm not gonna realise a loss, but the volatility suggests the investors don't understand the industry AMD is working in.\n\nEdit - Seems like my post isn't quite long enough for the Auto-mod, so let me elaborate. I am a C level exec in a multinational company that operates a significant proportion of their business in the eSports/gaming industry, former ACSI financial advisor, and not a diamond hand gorilla (not gonna lie, I've got 2 shares of GME at about $70 and about 36 AMC at about $10 average, but that's just to follow the madness).

        "selftext": "AMD was another stock targeted in Robinhood's restricted stock list late last week. This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.\n\nRobinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.\n\nThere are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))\n\nAlong with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.\n\nAMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.\n\nThe one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.\n\nHope this is all helpful!  \n\nDisclosure: I own 30 shares of AMD and will continue to hold for the years to come.",

        "selftext": "#  Let's get some facts down\n\nIntel recently replaced its CEO with [Pat Gelsinger](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-appoints-tech-industry-leader-pat-gelsinger-as-new-ceo/). He worked at VMWare as their CEO and has worked at Intel when he was 18. Right now [Rocket lake](https://www.pcgamer.com/new-benchmarks-show-intel-rocket-lake-chips-leading-comet-lake-and-amd-zen-3-in-single-core/) is set to release soon. Based on the success of [Tiger lake](https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release) this might put intel back into the game. They are also releasing [a GPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xe-hpg-tease-3dmark-mesh-shader/) soon. For more news like this, I would watch GamerNexus( Bot won't let me link it) who does really great reviews from the technical standpoint. They are planned to release 3nm and 5nm chips later this year or in 2022( They are just getting the contracts right now. No date yet). Also, they had an outstanding year despite losing their crown to $AMD back in Q4.\n\nJust on their own their looking to bounce right back up from the pandemic. They still have some grow room from a lower revenue year. I bet this stock could go to $90 or even to $100 with rocket lake, and that's a short term gain meaning tendies in time for summer. But what about the long term or market correction.\n\n# Data Analysis\n\n|CompanyMarket|Market cap|Dividends /share price|Q4 '20 revenue|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$INTC|250.07 billion|0.0213557676751335|20 billion|\n|$AMD|113.58 Billion|0.0154633678148662|3.24 billion|\n|$NVDA|370.44 Billion|0.0010694293591779|3.11 billion|\n\nAs someone who has been in the hardware space and is up to date on info Intel is underpriced compared to $AMD and $NVDA. What was holding intel back was the management and it changed. Intel is about to beat AMD and I would hop on the spaceship before it goes to the moon. so what is a reasonable price?\n\nif intel sock matches $AMD's Market Cap to revenue then its market cap would go to 700 billion. The positive press of the stock could bring it to 750 billion. But Intel's revenue is about to spike. President Joe Biden is planning to increase supply and if Intel can take advantage of that they can produce more chips where chips are out of stock. In 2020 GPU's sold out in a second leaving gamers without new gear. The 1050 ti, a failure when it came out, got rereleased and became one of the biggest successes this year. that's how desperate people are. [r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/) was hit the hardest and many of them want the fastest gear. Intel could fill this void left by AMD and NVDA. if Intel can get enough stuff out then I could see a trillion-dollar market cap( with market correction, meaning that intel gets a fair price).\n\nI currently do not have a position in INTC right now, but I plan to do so as soon as my wife's boyfriend will let me.\n\n^(This is not LEGALLY financial advice. this was written by an ape with 6 brain cells.)",

        "selftext": "Hello All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,  who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company  specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first  and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant  transposition of truck plans ready for production.FIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV SPAC, yet it has received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most EV SPACs. So what  gives?After doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding  back most investors back from committing to this great company is their  connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a  company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not  unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the  market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,  we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time  we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In  fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them  forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully  developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come to know, a  SPAC is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about? After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The AllStars](https://preview.redd.it/7nuwaytesih61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=545c748bd1fe6d8c68ced28d5ec2b3b14dab7bd2)\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**  he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and  SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now  known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).  Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.  Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,  which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the  powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and  what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has  some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to  EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and  Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing  different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build  improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it  comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,  because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and  innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.   Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now  Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies  in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation  for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of  Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.   He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more  importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few  different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows  what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,  Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during  which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into  automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board  of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.  One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a  group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**  (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.  This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry. Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,   during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also  helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European  and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some  international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well  as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at  the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to  understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.  Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware! Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum, Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.\n\n**David Boris \u2013**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 SPAC transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.   Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well, despite it being one SPAC that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for FIII.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Players](https://preview.redd.it/ebsz6bygsih61.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd9ab4dfdaf343e54fd6ea5cd803f1358fe53a77)\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***  \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**\n\n***Albert Li*** \u2013 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.\n\n***Benjamin Wu***  \u2013 15+ years \u2013 GC, Chief Legal Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive experience in M&amp;A and international  corporate transactions for both private and public companies.\n\nSo  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent  connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other  places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are  connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that  there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many  bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they  do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV SPACs aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Only Class 1 - no other competition](https://preview.redd.it/fkf5byrjsih61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=918b7c37a441b1dc5db3308cc03adde6b62b12a4)\n\nThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by 35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example, delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon, Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business. This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets, shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel, and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Custom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out need for 3rd party.](https://preview.redd.it/ivxxq0ylsih61.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=046d1737914b20c2561b902b67e06b1df73f829d)\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will  be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it. For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ion6yennsih61.png?width=1205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90f939ab66bef8d563902529c59681d7de2aaa2b\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of 142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van, representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to 60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox + Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others. These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in 2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of 100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand, establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000 preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.](https://preview.redd.it/e70l425psih61.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db1f03d707a18ffe69c02aa8a53ae4d24135ae4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.  Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the  mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed  results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on  creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new  ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite  possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring  more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area. Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan, Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021 shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Peculiar  section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County, VA  in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are  working on?](https://preview.redd.it/654d951rsih61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d86a264c5a413a3f93f0c7cff53de70d08cc7e19)\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**  received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the  Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s  economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**  in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)  tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in  Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent  start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering, ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around  $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so  far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico), Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.](https://preview.redd.it/ih444ymtsih61.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7220a5c0179175a34a8d4dac49b03d7710507ef)\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka, Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000 vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive  Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United  Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in  recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing  staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of  smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if  it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically  positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools. The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.   \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV SPAC is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually. Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China. Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid Motors! (CCIV  GANG IN THE HOUSE!! They are my #2 to my #1 baby here. I'm sorry for  cheating on you FIII!!)\n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla. At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars. This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately, ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.   \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past 2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above it and  turn it from resistance back into support. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59871x0ysih61.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd91fcd7da6cbbafcf5a336af79f9e23c0747e7\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\n[The ELMS tree](https://preview.redd.it/05c5j9o4tih61.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94648f9e4e79c77df21e06307962fc64daed3f09)\n\n^(Positions: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons)\n\n^(Note: Options just came out last week.

Buy INTC on Tuesday, or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70$ and buy then. Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual. \n\nYesterday I expressed (but not nearly enough) how Intel is like a beautiful meal. You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel's AI/machine learning/neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish (Data). \n\nIll wait for the price to be more ripe (which it will in the coming weeks) to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker. I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70$ per share. \n\nToday I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run.  \n\n1.) The most obvious is one that is already partially in play, and also partially responsible for INTCs 24% YTD returns. The changing of leadership at Intel. As you might know this Monday (markets closed) Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel. Catalyst 1.1 was his appointment, catalyst 1.2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements. When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully (which he has been doing lately). There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week. If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive. Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days/weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception.  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nSmall side note, the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat, there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request (some returning from retirement). INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops. All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top. These people don't fuck around and they bleed Intel. \n\n2.) Semiconductor shortage. As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries. GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently, but this is not just affecting the auto industry, it is affecting dozens of different industries (some more than others). What does this mean for Intel? Well, Intel makes chips. They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n3.) This one is at least in part linked to the second point, but goes beyond that. Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry. Last week the SIA (Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry). Please read the one page letter, and your conclusion will be the same as mine. This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry. [https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf) It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter: Intel. Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company (a Taiwanese company for that matter (risks associated with this I have discussed in another post)). Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term. This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas. Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion. What does this mean? It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger, richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nExpect tax breaks and subsidies soon (that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively). In fact, as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon.\n\n4.) Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year. The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen. Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically (yet) although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year. Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn't already been exhausted, that can still give them strong returns. I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much? There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential, and in a parabolic industry (semis). This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play. You get this stock to be memetic and it flies.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n5.) Strong market correction. As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March. They have all turned out to be wrong (so far). Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing (from bearish insider transaction numbers, yield on the 10 year, and the bizarre VIX action). To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I'm quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months (so long as the fed and white house play along(and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2% or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named)). \n\nIn any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most. Speculation in the stock is low for now, large long term (boomer holders). The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich. It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues. Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company. AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies. The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel's market share. \n\nFurther if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates (again due to risk perception and lack of leverage) Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nI get it, its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD, besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year. You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years. You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on $$ losing track of the most important thing, product quality. \n\nDon't let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities.  \n\nYou see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips. They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover, in time.\n\nCome back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2% and closes the week up 10% sniffing 70$ per share. \n\nI reiterate my position:\n\n1700 shares, 500 April 16 80$ strike calls, and 50 February 26 65$ strike calls.  \n\n **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**",

Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**\n\n**\\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! So, let\u2019s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.\n\n**\\[Disclosure: I made this DD last month, but I wasn't part of this Subreddit until the last few days\\]**\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company\u2019s total net sales in the last fiscal year.\n\nAlso, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.\n\nAlongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook\u2019s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.\n\nWe also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that\u2019s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.\n\nThe 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.\n\nThey also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.\n\nBut the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.\n\nThe latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.\n\nI think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.\n\nWe also shouldn\u2019t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.\n\nAnd one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.\n\nI think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple\u2019s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.\n\nBut this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.\n\nAnd last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.\n\nI also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don\u2019t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.\n\nSo, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don\u2019t be afraid to leave a comment down below.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.\n\nThis are my 2025 projections for Apple, let\u2019s take a closer look at them, each on their own.\n\nSo, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.\n\nThe next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.\n\nThe iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.\n\nThe 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.\n\nI gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.\n\nAnd last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don\u2019t forget any others.\n\nSo, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.\n\nI think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.\n\nIn terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \\[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \\] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.\n\nIn the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company\u2019s supplier\u2019s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.\n\nSo, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.\n\nI also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.\n\nI think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don\u2019t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.\n\nThis money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.\n\nMoving on, let\u2019s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.\n\nThis would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.\n\nSo, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don\u2019t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today\u2019s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.\n\nI don\u2019t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.\n\nSo [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.\n\nI think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.\n\nSo here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \\[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \\] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nKeep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?\n\nThe company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn\u2019t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it\u2019s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock.

        "selftext": "Tired of missing the boat on meme stocks? This is a real solid play with very limited downside, and unlimited upside.\n\nDD: I believe $INTC (Intel) will be the greatest value play in this year.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Extremely undervalued P/E ratio of only 12.37x\n* Industry competitors P/E ratio AMD: 40.88x\n* Industry competitor 2 P/E ratio NVDA:  79.67x\n* Fair evaluation of P/E means to match AMD's PE ratio INTC should be sitting around $200/share.\n* Although Intel has missed its progression on nm competition vs AMD and NVDA, Intel is entering the GPU market and also remains one of the largest market caps in the industry.\n* Biden recently formally requested a supply chain review to become more independent from Chinese suppliers for the semiconductor industry, which both AMD and NVDA heavily rely on, but INTC is producing everything in house.\n\nCurrent assessment of INTC is all bearish, which means you can get the stock at a heavy discount. INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage.\nAlthough AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU. If INTC becomes fairly valued at industry PE ratios of their competitors of even just AMD, then fair value INTC stock price should hit near $200 per share levels. Currently INTC sits at around ~$60/share. Intel entering the GPU market will add significant value for the stock in addition to its strong internal supply chain in the US.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2021/02/24/bidens-supply-chain-executive-order-should-remind-all-business-leaders-to-be-prepared-for-a-crisis/\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/giant-fund-bought-ev-stocks-nio-tesla-intel-sold-ge-51613755670\n\n\nPositions Disclosure:\nI currently hold 300 shares of $INTC and 4C $100 strike EXP 1/21/22\n\n\nDisclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

        "selftext": "With the pandemic still going on and everyone needing more computers than ever and the ongoing trade war with China, there is a severe Chip shortage.\n\nOn Thursday, the CEOs of the major Chip producers (Intel, AMD, QCOM) have sent a letter to Biden that he should sent out an executive order to adress this shortage. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage))\n\nI see three different scenarios:\n\n1. Biden gives an executive order to build improve and increase the domestic chip foundries. This would be most bullish for Intel, since they are the only company with foundries in the USA. This would also help AMD and QCOM, since they would most likely that access to cheaper chips.\n2. Biden lifts the trade restrictions set on semiconductors. This would mean that AMD and QCOM would get access to cheaper chips, but it would not solve the shortage of silicon so it is unlikely to happen. This would be bullish for AMD and Qualcomm, but it would not change the situation for Intel.\n3. Biden does not do anything and the shortage will continue. If Biden does this nothing will be changed, it will be neither good or bad from Intel and AMD. AMD will still keep growing at a massive rate and Intel will still be a cash cow.\n\nSo regardless of what happens, I am very bullish on the semiconductor industry. I expect Biden to start ramping up semiconductor manufacturing the USA, because of his tough stance on China. At the moment almost all of the semiconductor industry is relying on Taiwan, and with the Chinese involvement in that country, it is very likely that their is bipartisan support for increasing semiconductor manufacturing domestically.\n\nAdvice: if you want to play this, buy calls that are at least 2 to 3 months out, or buy shares.\n\nMy positions:\n\nINTC shares @ 50.50\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, before buying anything, please do your own research.",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

        "selftext": "The American semiconductor manufacturing industry has been decimated by production moving to Taiwan. Intel has lost market share in the past few years but has made a public [commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/intel-gives-upbeat-forecast-on-demand-for-pc-chips-shares-jump) to continue manufacturing excellence. Recently they hired a new CEO who starts next week, Pat Gelsinger. The stock surged 7% on the news of his hire.\n\nThe United States is committed to not bending over and letting foreign companies and government control US chip supply forever. It has already been acknowledged as a mistake and they are trying to reverse the course. [Chip shortages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/chip-shortage-spirals-beyond-cars-to-phones-and-game-consoles) in the auto industry have started and are already shutting down production lines in the US. The Biden administration is incentivized to [move quickly](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) here.\n\nBiden's team is desperately trying to take a tough stance on China since it's a popular policy that has clear benefits to American business. Even Fox news is [acknowledging](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-china-economic-threat-xi-jinping-campaign-2019) that Biden is trying to prevent unfair trade practices. What better way than to publicly commit to supporting American semiconductor manufacturing? That's where lobbying comes in. Bloomberg [reported today](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/u-s-chip-industry-urges-biden-to-support-domestic-production) that Intel, AMD (bless Lisa Su), and Qualcomm signed a letter to the Biden administration urging policy to bring back manufacturing.\n\nAn announcement of support and stimulus to the American semiconductor industry would get bipartisan support and boost chip stocks. Intel is the most beaten down of the names and has the manufacturing business that will see a surge when this policy is released. Intel is the great risk-reward play here.\n\n\\----\n\nSOURCES: See the hyperlinks in the text above to learn more about the need for semiconductor manufacturing within the US and how seriously the government is taking it.\n\nTLDR: Intel will be the biggest beneficiary of the Biden administration's protectionist policies to revive domestic chip production and prevent shortages throughout the auto sector. Buy shares or calls to get sufficient exposure. I am long shares.",

        "selftext": "So I saw headlines about semiconductor demand far outpacing supply. There\u2019s also news of Intel finally giving up and no longer taking losses trying to make chips. \nCars have created an especially huge demand for semis and virtually every car now needs one. \n\nhttps://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319627-semiconductor-shortage-could-cost-automakers-61b-in-lost-sales\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29T04V\n\nI came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple. \n\nhttps://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=TSM\n\nNow, I couldn\u2019t believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true: \nMarket Cap- 571 billion\n2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic). \nEarnings- 530billion.  \n\nThis means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio. \n\nCompare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E.\nIntel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E\n\nSo shouldn\u2019t TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%??? \n\nI think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12. \n\nSomeone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer. \n\nAlso, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA \n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/11/25/intels-ceo-just-asked-joe-biden-to-do-this/\n\nLastly, Biden has a phone call with TSM this Friday.\n\n\nEDIT: thank you for pointing out that my numbers were in TWN not USD.  I effed up.  Still a great company.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR**: this juicy mature wants to do a dance and i want to be her full-time owner and part-time lover\n\n# Introduction\n\nblah blah blah, at&amp;t is a big ol' bitch:\n\n&gt;AT&amp;T Inc. is the world's largest telecommunications company, the largest provider of mobile telephone services, and the largest provider of fixed telephone services in the United States. Since June 14, 2018, it is also the parent company of WarnerMedia, making it the world's largest media and entertainment company in terms of revenue. As of 2020, AT&amp;T was ranked 9 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations, with revenues of $181 billion.\n\nI copied this from Wikipedia\n\nBelieve it or not, AT&amp;T (@\\~29/share at the moment) has something going for it at the moment. For starters, it's still about 25% below its January 2020 highs. Furthermore, the stock has good fundamentals and a bunch of strong potential short-term catalysts: there looks to be insider option buying activity, there's a few potential deals to be made, and lastly (perhaps most importantly) the options are cheap with a low IV. We'll start with the bear case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Bear case\n\nNone of the shit below comes to light and the big buys (assumed to be insiders) were looking for something else in this trade. Maybe  whatever caused this 4% increase this last week or so was enough for them and they've already exited.\n\nAlternatively, it turns out they didn't get nearly as much of the 5G bands as we would've hoped.\n\nAnother possibility is that the meme stocks fly again and people rotate out of safe stocks like AT&amp;T in the short-term.\n\nNow for the bull case:\n\n## Pre-COVID days\n\nThis is a tech and entertainment stock that has yet to recover from COVID a year later \\[[chart](https://i.imgur.com/yPwJY6F.png)\\]. This is purely about price, but this year has not left them in bad shape, profit is down only about 16% since the same (final) quarter the year before. \\[[link](https://www.investors.com/research/att-stock-buy-now/)\\]\n\n## Fundamentals\n\nAs far I can see it, this stock has good fundamentals. $T has a **book value of about $22.69/share**, meanwhile the stock trades at about $29 a share\\[[link](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbo-max-subscriber-update)\\]\\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/t/key-statistics/)\\]. There is a fantastic built-in bottom on this stock.Disney (which is now priced like a tech stonk) only has about double the streaming customers that $T has and it trades at 297% of book \\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/dis/key-statistics/)\\]. That's all I've got for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short-term catalysts\n\n## Potential Insider Trading\n\nI first came across this on [unusualwhales.com](http://unusualwhales.com/) last week, but /u/FluxRevived does a good job explaining the potential here \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ll6kne/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/)\\].\n\nTo summarize, there has recently been an insane amount of buying on OTM T calls \\[[link](https://i.imgur.com/jc2i7hw.png)\\], this doesn't just happen for no reason. Whoever is behind that trade likely knows something (I think something to do with the airwave auction) and I don't think it's the meager 3-4% gain we've seen since the order occurred. I could be completely wrong.\n\nCompare that activity to something like Intel \\[[link](https://i.imgur.com/pWFCgVw.png)\\], and you can see that it's much more divisive. Rarely do you see so many orders come through over a relatively long period with so little ambiguity.\n\n## *5G Auction*\n\nThe more I read about this, the more this makes sense. For those of you that don't know (I sure as shit didn't) there was a 3 month battle **81 billion dollar battle** **for 5G** airwaves that ended the day before yesterday \\[[link](https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107)\\].\n\nOut of the 81 billion spent, AT&amp;T spent about 23 billion to Verizon's 40 billion \\[[link](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2021/01/07/att-auction.html)\\], but there were 57 bidders \\[[link](https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107)\\]. T-Mobile doesn't seem to have bid beyond a few billion\\[[link](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/t-mobile-borrows-us-3b-in-heated-fight-for-5g-airwaves-1.1546747)\\], which means that AT&amp;T will likely get a lion's share of the 5G airwaves along with Verizon. The winners will likely be announced on **Friday, February 26th** \\[[link](https://www.lightreading.com/the-edge/5g-in-us-will-get-lot-clearer-by-march-31---heres-why/a/d-id/767368)\\], and I have a sneaking suspicion that AT&amp;T won a good chunk (see \"Potential Insider Trading\").\n\nThis is my favorite catalyst, and I think the most likely to cause a price increase in the short term.\n\n## Flight to quality\n\nFundamentals are boring \\[[link](https://twitter.com/simplejackcap/status/1341388555839528960?lang=en)\\] but the market is looking choppy and it's not unreasonable to think that during a choppy market there will be a flight to quality \\[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight-to-quality)\\], and there is quality and safety in AT&amp;T my dudes.\n\nDid I mention they have a 7% dividend \\[[link](https://www.investors.com/research/att-stock-buy-now/)\\]? Boomers fucking love that shit, they never fucking sell and there's a built-in bottom at 22.69 a share.\n\n## Streaming\n\nI didn't even know AT&amp;T owned HBOMax before researching this shit but apparently they have some originals and they just came out with that Mortal Kombat stuff.I dunno, maybe they'll announce something that's actually cool soon?Potential catalyst here I guessTheir streaming service is actually decent, they have 37 million paying customers \\[[link](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbo-max-subscriber-update)\\], which is only about 60% less than Disney+'s 95 million.\n\n## AST SpaceMobile and Palantir\n\nAT&amp;T wants to give you phone coverage from space. I don't really know what's going on here, this SpaceMobile shit is only going to start getting action in 2023 (aka: i dont give a shit) \\[[link](https://www.lightreading.com/ossbss/vodafone-atandt-sign-up-for-5g-via-spacemobiles-satellites/d/d-id/766194)\\], but some people think there is a potential catalyst here, you can read more if you want \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ll6kne/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/)\\].\n\nAT&amp;T definitely seems to be a customer of Palantir, but they didn't announce a full-on partnership on Palantir earnings. I'm skeptical of anything newsworthy coming out soon; still, there's some dd out there if you like \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ll6kne/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/)\\]\n\n## Online interest\n\nOnline interest is growing, there have been threads on the palantir subreddit \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/lhcy8p/att_is_100_a_customer_of_palantir/)\\], the options subreddit \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ll6kne/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/)\\], smallstreetbets (you may have already seen it) \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lhpoor/possible_insider_trading_on_att_dd_inside/gmzkcm1/)\\], and twitter \\[[link](https://mobile.twitter.com/nope_its_lily/status/1362148921082978312)\\]\\[[link](https://twitter.com/RedditTraderGuy/status/1359584827046043654)\\]\\[[link](https://twitter.com/ChartingOptions/status/1357053461347635203)\\]\\[[link](https://twitter.com/ChartingOptions/status/1358470986929160194)\\]. It doesn't really seem to be catching on (lmfao), but if online interest picks up we can see the IV (currently at about 25% for early March calls) really pick up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Options are cheap\n\nIV is low and the greeks are good, check out the options chain \\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/T/options?date=1614902400)\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## The end.\n\nThat's all I got for you guys.\n\n**FULL disclosure:** i bought some 3/5 30.5 calls earlier this week, and bought more yesterday.\n\n**my positions:** 3/5 30.5C and 2/26 30C\n\n**professional background in investing:** i bought a thicc book on options in sophomore year of high school (about 8 years ago) and thought i would be a market genius. i never got past page 15\n\nGood luck out there!",

INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage. Although AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU. If INTC becomes fairly valued at industry PE ratios of their competitors of even just AMD, then fair value INTC stock price should hit near $200 per share levels. Currently INTC sits at around ~$60/share. Intel entering the GPU market will add significant value for the stock in addition to its strong internal supply chain in the US.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/giant-fund-bought-ev-stocks-nio-tesla-intel-sold-ge-51613755670\n\nPositions Disclosure: I currently hold 300 shares of $INTC and 4C $100 strike EXP 1/21/22\n\nDisclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

        "selftext": "Yesterday I put out my first DD piece on Intel, the most undervalued high cap company in the US stock market. Of course it left a sour but familiar taste in the mouths of Lisa Su's cuck army and AMD fanboys. Today I'm here with another treat for you, don't be shy I know deep down you like it. \n\nHonestly Intel has so many juicy bits of DD to squeeze out its hard to pick where to start. \n\n[from Intel's 10K pg17](https://preview.redd.it/oxulb5pl7ah61.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed1d4f2b7e110578ceafa5d0cb790a7fb85d476d)\n\nNevertheless I know you are hungry so Ill start with an appetizer. \n\nMobileye\n\nDon't be fooled, If Mobileye was an independent company it would probably be you guys' main dish and desert after it had been pumped to a 100B market cap like many of the \"tech of the future\" sector stocks. The reality is, Mobileye is the future and the 100B market cap would probably not be that outlandish in this market. One word:\n\nAutonomous vehicles.\n\nThat's right, a market that is in its most infant state but that has the potential to be bigger than the United Kingdoms economy by 2030. \n\nDon't take it from me \"The market is then expected to recover and grow at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2021 ad reach $1,191.8 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $1,642.9 billion in 2025 growing at a CAGR of 17.4%, and $3,195.0 billion in 2030 growing at a CAGR of 14.2%. \"1\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img g8cc9qtt9ah61...*\n\nMobileye is one of the leaders in the autonomous vehicle industry and is poised not just to grow in market share but to take over. Last year they brought in for Intel a cool Billion, yeah I know its nothing much, its just double AMDs net earnings last quarter and about 1 and a bit% of Intel's annual revenues. Oh yeah I know you must be seething at the way I am phrasing this. \n\nProfessor Amnon Shashua (CEO of Mobileye) who you will be calling Daddy very soon when your asymmetric relationship with Su Bae doesn't work out had some interesting things to say this year, \" Despite unprecedented challenges to the auto industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we secured more than 37 new design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Geely and Ford. We are currently active in 49 production programs1  across over 25 OEMs.\" \n\nIntel also acquired Moovit to facilitate Mobileyes dominance, \"We acquired Moovit to accelerate Mobileye's MaaS offering. Moovit is known for its urban mobility application and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services.\"\n\nFuck Tesla fake autonomous driving program, when the robo taxis do come they will have mobileye in them. \n\nIntel bought Mobileye for 15.3 Billion $ in March 2017 when they were at the start of a year that brought them 200 million $ in revenue. You see what I mean when I say this could be valued at 100B in market cap given the current market (Its a type of bubble(might not pop but its still a bubble), IDGAF what you say). \n\nBut Intel's market cap is only 250B? What's going on here Mr Market? Have you been eating crayons? Its alright, a little nudge and you will wake up. \n\nBy buying Intel you are in effect able to buy a stake in the future of autonomous vehicles at tremendous discount. \n\nLike I said, this is just a little treat. Intel is a full meal and it has a lot to give.\n\n1700 INTC shares, 500 April 16th 80$ strike calls and yesterday before close I added a little 50 Feb 26th 65$ strikes for good measure. Your wife's boyfriend is counting on you to be smart and by Intel calls or you wont be able to subsidize their trip to the Maldives.\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150806/0/en/Global-Autonomous-Cars-Market-2020-to-2030-Opportunities-and-Strategies-with-COVID-19-Growth-and-Change.html#:\\~:text=28%2C%202020%20(GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE),added%20to%20ResearchAndMarkets.com's%20offering.&amp;text=The%20market%20is%20then%20expected,reach%20%241%2C191.8%20billion%20in%202023](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150806/0/en/Global-Autonomous-Cars-Market-2020-to-2030-Opportunities-and-Strategies-with-COVID-19-Growth-and-Change.html#:~:text=28%2C%202020%20(GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE),added%20to%20ResearchAndMarkets.com's%20offering.&amp;text=The%20market%20is%20then%20expected,reach%20%241%2C191.8%20billion%20in%202023). \\*1\n\n[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market)\\*2\n\nAnd I leave here a link to Intel's very elucidating 10K that I know you wont read.\n\n[https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings?form\\_type=10-K&amp;year=2021](https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings?form_type=10-K&amp;year=2021)\n\nenjoy,",

        "selftext": "It\u2019s only a matter of time before it is discovered by more and more people. Do your own research and you will know. But here are some key points which made me think seriously about ACEV Achronix merger . The whole SPAC market is filled with companies with absurd financials and negative growth but this one stood out for its potential \n\n1. Achronix is the Only independent FPGA and eFPGA maker. FPGA falls under the category of data accelerators such as GPUs but it\u2019s faster, flexible  and more power efficient than GPUs\nTheir target market is high growth AI apps, cloud computing, 5G and automotive driver assistance \nand the crypto industry\n\n2. There are only 2 other main players\nAlterra was acquired by Intel few years ago, and Xilinx was acquired by AMD , that leaves Achronix as the only independent FPGA maker. This is important as it could also become a prime candidate for acquisition by Nvidia ( just a thought) \n\n3. Their latest product speedster 7 is geared more towards AI/ML AND data acceleration\nThis is crucial If you look at Ark big ideas 2021, They have mentioned Compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR) of 17% for deep learning. The Arm big ideas also talk about Data center reinvention where majority of the processor change is driven by data accelerators  ( GPUs and FPGA likes ) which again grows at 21% CAGR. \n\nAchronix has a huge dependency on Intel for their previous generation product but also gives them a committed revenue for next year and the dependency is projected to go down to 23-26% by 2023 . Their latest product speedster 7 has secured offers from atleast 6 customers and many more are in pipeline \n\nOn the merger - \n\nhttps://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf\n\n79% gross margin for 2020 with CAGR of 20-25% in coming years\n\nThey have a non cancellable order of 160mn next year with 1.1 billion in identified opportunities in next year driven by speedster product \n\nMerger is estimated at about 2.1 bn approx 12 times their sales compared that with AMD Xilinx merger ( done at 30 times sales )\n\nACEV team - are industry veterans. They grew netlogic for  3.7 bn $ by Broadcom and TDK invensense acquisition of 1.3 bn \n\nOne of the founding members Dr. Sunny Siu has deep ties with the academia. These are the guys who are part of the cutting edge research and have a passion for entrepreneurship - these are the people who I see as capable enough to change the world. Among his many academic accomplishments, he was the founding director of MIT auto ID ( pioneer of IOT research) at MIT. They have been around semis and am sure they know what they are doing not some rich guy trying to acquire some random company\n\nhttp://acev.io/investor-info/board-of-directors/default.aspx",

        "selftext": "Despite my wife's wishes we are going to be naming our firstborn Joby. Why you ask? Because Joby Aviation ($RTP) is the future. Not a claim I'd make idly, and not one I'd spend weeks of DD on. Disclaimer: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I'M JUST SLIGHTLY OBSESSED WITH eVTOLs (do your own DD). I think the tech is cool, the market is massive, the players are big, and the future is *now*. Without further ado...\n\n# Intro -\n\n\nYou thought EV's were the next big thing? Sure carbon neutral transportation with self-driving tech is cool, but you know what's not cool? Sitting in your beautifully crafted &amp; environmentally friendly Tesla / Lucid / Fisker / Nio / XPeng masterpiece at a dead stop...in traffic...on the ground. Wouldn't it be cool if your Tesla could just sprout wings and fly away? How about vertically so you could do it downtown? You'd laugh and scoff saying that dream is wayyy off. That's when I'd slap your face with my bologna sandwich, squeeze your cheeks, and point your gaze towards this:\n\n[Joby S4 Aircraft](https://preview.redd.it/k5j50etasxj61.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fe1ef5a7a7e1ab9b3d44ac09acce679873ef1e8)\n\nHere come the \"Haha cute mockup &amp; promises, call me when there's proof in the pudding\" comments (justifiably imo). This one's for you. This *isn't* a concept drawing - it's a working production model eVTOL made by Joby Aviation. Let me list off some facts before we dive down into some detail on each:\n\n* Partnered with the United States Air Force through their [Agility Prime Program](https://agilityprime.com/#/)\n* Awarded 10 patents with 18 more pending\n* 10+ years of engineering (est. 2009) and more than a 1000 test flights\n* Has worked with the FAA and agreed upon G-1 certification\n* Granted the U.S. Air Force's first ever eVTOL airworthiness approval\n* Acquired Uber Elevate (Joby absorbed them + additional investment by Uber)\n* Institutional backing by Toyota / Capricorn / Baillie Gifford  / Intel / Jet Blue / Uber\n* Developed \"The Future of Aircraft Propulsion\" - [LEAPTech](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/Features/leaptech.html) \\- with NASA\n* Based in the United States with a [600 job providing factory](https://cityofmarina.org/946/Environmental-Documents) being built in Marina CA\n\nI have more but we'll save them for a rainy day! Now to get into the weeds (just not SNDL)...\n\n# Agility Prime Program -\n\n\"The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., \"flying cars\").\n\nLeveraging unique testing resources and revenue generating government use cases for distributed logistics and disaster response, the government plans to mitigate current commercial market and regulatory risks.\n\nAgility Prime also aims to bring together industry, investor, and government communities to establish safety and security standards while accelerating commercialization of this revolutionary technology.\n\nThe Innovative Capabilities Opening establishes a rapid contracting mechanism beginning in 2020 with a \u201cRace to Certification\u201d series to drive government procurement of operational capability by 2023.\"\n\nThe USAF sees success of Joby as success for them. Joby can use the Agility Prime program as a) a first realizable revenue source and b) as an expedited path towards FAA certification / public acceptance.\n\nWant to know what the Chief of Staff of the USAF has to say on eVTOL? Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg_qPXvu21I).\n\n# Patents -\n\n\nMultiple patents granted (10) with more pending (18). Let's look at the key patents *granted* (again, I want to keep this DD grounded on facts, not promises - this is like the EV market where there will be a lot of shell companies built on promises and marketing teams).\n\n1. [Aircraft Control System and Method](https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20200092052) \\-  \"Joby\u2019s unified command system includes an input mechanism,\u00a0a flight processor, a control output and effectors (e.g. control surfaces and motor power levels). The patent says the system can also accommodate optional sensors that would determine the vehicle state and or/flight regime and flightpath.\"\n2. [Electric Tiltrotor Aircraft](https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20200148347) \\-  \"Highlights that the six propellers of the Generation 2.0 air taxi are arranged on three different planes. The cantilevering tilt mechanisms extend the propeller disk away from the leading edge of the wing to achieve a desired hover arrangement and disk position relative to the other disks. **The propellers can also be designed to be \u201carticulated into a negative angle of attack, which can function to produce reverse thrust without changing the direction of rotation of the propeller,\u201d which is a technique used by short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft to do a steep landing approach without gaining air speed.**\" (military drooling)\n3. [Aircraft Noise Mitigation](https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=10843807&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D10843807.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F10843807%2526RS%3DPN%2F10843807&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page) \\-  \"The method can additionally or alternatively function to: spread out the acoustic power of the emitted sound across the acoustics frequency spectrum; shift the acoustic frequency spectrum of the emitted sound; reduce the total acoustic power of the emitted sound; dynamically adjust the frequency spectrum of the emitted sound,\u201d all of which will use \u00a0a network of acoustic sensors on the aircraft and or at ground positions to reduce the tonality of the acoustic spectrum emitted by the aircraft in flight. One of the novel concepts is the ability to automatically shift the angles of attack of individual blades on a single propeller hub by 1\u20133\u00b0 based on the acoustic emissions of the propeller. Another mode allows the six propellers on the aircraft to operate at different RPM speeds (and blade pitches) to shift the noise spectrum, which would be extremely challenging to achieve with fuel-burning engines.\"\n\n**(Side note: this is one of the most important patents when considering wide public adoption. In conjunction with LEAPTech (providing a LOT of redundancy and safety) they will be the biggest factors in bringing Joby to market. In addition though - where else would noise suppression be critical? Perhaps covert military operations. Imagine the ability to land an unmanned eVTOL for extraction / insertion with 100x less sound, better engine / roto redundancy, the ability to handle steeper angles of approach, and almost as much speed as an Apache (200 mph vs 227 mph)? Perhaps this would be valuable to the US Armed Forces?)**\n\n4)  [Battery Thermal Management System](https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?Docid=20200339010&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPG01%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D%25252220200339010%252522.PGNR.%2526OS%3DDN%2F20200339010%2526RS%3DDN%2F20200339010&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=9210D57B4595) \\- \"Includes a battery pack, circulation subsystem and heat exchanger, and can optionally include a cooling system, reservoir, de-ionization filter, battery charger and controller. This system is designed to set the temperature of a battery pack, determine the heat and redistribute the heat within the pack.\n\nIn a typical trip plan, for example, the system would calculate \u00a0the expected power consumption based on the distance, calculate the expected heat that would be generated from the power consumption, and redistribute the heat in the battery pack with circulating fluid to equalize the temperature to cool or heat the pack.\n\nA variation of the system could include a ground-based cooling system that would establish the ideal battery temperature for a specific trip and provide the necessary heating or cooling, greatly reducing the weight of the onboard system.\n\nThe system is also designed to automatically plan for contingencies, such as the loss of \u00a0motor, which \u00a0would \u00a0lead \u00a0to an automatic power increase on the operating motor and the need to re-distribute the resulting heat. The system would also automatically respond to a change in flight profile or aircraft routing by adjusting the flow of the circulation in the battery pack to meet the required temperature profile.\"\n\n5)  [Airfoil and Design Method](http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20200331602) \\-  \"A new and useful rotary airfoil and design method that addressed both aerodynamics and acoustic requirements. Joby found that the conventional way of optimizing airfoils for aerodynamic efficiency can have adverse and counterintuitive effects on the acoustic performance of the airfoil and propeller. This could mean that to improve the acoustics signature, an airfoil might incur a performance penalty of up to 3%.\u00a0Compounding positive effects on blade acoustics include tapering the blade along the length, twisting the blade, and setting a different angle at the blade tip.\"\n\n6)  [Electric Power System Architecture and Fault Tolerant VTOL Aircraft](https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20200010187) \\-  \"Designing an eVTOL power system for high reliability requires the system architecture to instantaneously accommodate battery, motor or winding failure. For a six-motor aircraft, where each motor may be powered by two or more batteries, and each motor has two or more windings, with each winding powered by a different battery. In the event of a failed winding, failed battery or failed motor, the power routing would automatically be altered to provide proper attitude control and to provide sufficient thrust.\n\nThe power requirements vary during five phases of the flight profile: hover out of ground effect, vertical ascent, vertical descent, cruise climb and cruise. In each scenario, there is a normal operating power requirement and an emergency power requirement, which could vary from 50 kW under normal circumstances in a hover to 130 kW for hover in an emergency situation, such as a motor failure.\n\nThe system is designed such that if a motor failure occurs, to maintain pitch and roll control, the flight computer reduces power on the opposing motor as needed, as the remaining four motors increase to emergency power to compensate for the two motors that are shut down.\n\nThe batteries are distributed throughout the aircraft to enhance reliability and fault tolerance. The major concern is loss of control of the aircraft as a result of a sudden shift in attitude resulting from the failure of one of the propellers in hover. By linking a battery that powers the furthest outboard motor on the other side of the centerline of the aircraft, a battery failure then has its effect more spread out across the aircraft, reducing the amount of impact a battery failure would have on the aircraft\u2019s attitude.\"\n\n7)  [Vehicle Navigation System](https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=10845823&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D10845823.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F10845823%2526RS%3DPN%2F10845823&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page) \\-  \"Fuses sensors and uses a voting scheme to continually determine the vehicle state.\"\n\n8)  [Airspeed Determination](https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?Docid=20200324910&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPG01%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D%25252220200324910%252522.PGNR.%2526OS%3DDN%2F20200324910%2526RS%3DDN%2F20200324910&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=656C4A3C2C95) \\- \"A system to determine the airspeed of an aircraft based on a set of propeller operating parameters and models. The system could reduce weight and drag of other airspeed systems and reduce system complexity.\"\n\n[Complete list of patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/joby-aero-inc).\n\nWhew... well if you've made it this far / skimmed (the true art of a master retail trader) what do these patents tell us? Joby isn't dreaming of the tech. They aren't *planning* on making noise reducing / rotor / engine / flight system / airfoil / navigation tech - they already have it. They haven't been using their 10+ years in the space drafting up cool [futuristic drawings](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg) ^(cough Archer cough). So... what *have* they been doing?\n\n# 10+ Years of Development -\n\n\nFrom their [site](https://www.jobyaviation.com/) and my own research:\n\n**2009** \\- Day and night, a small team of seven engineers worked out of \u201cThe Barn,\u201d Joby's workshop in the mountains above Santa Cruz. They explored the frontiers of technologies like electric motors, flight software, and lithium-ion batteries \u2014 engineering almost every component from the ground up.\n\n**2012 -**  Beginning in 2012, Joby was selected to collaborate with NASA on several groundbreaking electric flight projects, including the X-57 and LEAPTech.\n\n**2015 -**  Joby's first subscale prototype flew for the first time in 2015.\n\n**2017 -**  Joby's first full-scale prototype took to the skies in 2017.\n\n**2019 -**  Joby's first production prototype began a rigorous flight testing program. With more than 1,000 test flights behind them, they plan to certify their aircraft in 2023, and begin commercial operations in 2024.\n\n**2020 -**  We agreed to a \"G-1\" certification basis for our aircraft with the FAA, laying a clear path to certifying our aircraft for commercial flights. The U.S. Air Force also granted its first ever eVTOL airworthiness approval to Joby as part of its Agility Prime program.\n\n**2020 -**  Toyota to share expertise in manufacturing, quality and cost controls for the development and production of Joby Aviation\u2019s breakthrough eVTOL\u00a0aircraft. Toyota has invested $394M as lead investor in Joby\u2019s Series C\u00a0financing\n\n**2020 -**  Long-term partnership with Toray Advanced Composites. Bringing Joby's vision of safe and affordable zero-emissions flight to reality means designing and manufacturing an aircraft that is both robust and lightweight. Toray are\u00a0well-known for their long history of meeting mechanical and safety requirements in aerospace and Joby is excited to be using Toray's carbon fiber materials in their aircraft.\n\n**2020 -**  Joby Aviation will acquire Uber Elevate, while the two parent companies have agreed to integrate their respective services into each other\u2019s apps, enabling seamless integration between ground and air travel for future customers.\u00a0\"*The team at Uber Elevate has not only played an important role in our industry, but it has also developed a remarkable set of software tools that build on more than a decade of experience enabling on-demand mobility. These tools and new team members will be invaluable to us as we accelerate our plans for commercial launch.\"*\n\n**2021 -**  Joby announced that it has begun generating revenue as part of achieving another major milestone in the Agility Prime program. This comes on the heels of the company being awarded the Air Force\u2019s first-ever airworthiness approval for an eVTOL vehicle at the end of 2020. They also revealed the first video of their [S4 craft flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wbFw165ar0&amp;t=2s) and [taking off](https://youtu.be/OAKCbpwmrgI?t=92) (this is an incredibly demonstration of their noise suppression).\n\n# Institutional Backing -\n\n\n\"Hey who cares if they have the tech, team, funding, partnerships, etc. I wanna know if any big boys are invested because they have a lot more access to the true state of the business than we do.\"\n\nI hear you. How's Uber, Intel, NASA, the United States Air Force, Toyota, Jet Blue, Baillie Gifford, and Capricorn sound? Also, for those of you who *know* that a lot of SPACs are heavily focused on fairly quick profits for the SPAC team (a lot of them sell off when lockup expires @ merger) and PIPE investors. What if I told you that $RTP x Joby DA mentions \"Joby and Reinvent have developed an unprecedented structure providing for significant long-term alignment. Both parties have agreed to a long-term lock-up on founder shares for up to five years, and a robust earnout structure with full vesting not realized until the share price reaches $50 per share (implying over a $30 billion market capitalization). Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well.\" This isn't just a quick play for the *real* investors. Also Cathie Woods had been buying up $ACIC and $EXPC like crazy, I predict she adds $RTP very soon (will update if so).\n\n# US Based -\n\n\nLet's face some facts - Chinese based businesses are inherently more risky in today's market. Trump took a fairly hard line, and Biden's administration hasn't indicated they intend to be buddy buddy. In fact, just today (Feb. 26th 2020): \"The Biden administration plans to allow a sweeping Trump-era rule aimed at combating Chinese technology threats to take effect next month, over objections from U.S. businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.\" There has been heightened scrutiny of Chinese made tech, and EHang falls in this bucket. It will be very difficult to attain commercial success and public approval for an autonomous Chinese eVTOL. Joby is based in the US and is currently building a factory for their craft in Marina CA. They estimate this factory will produce 600+ high-skilled jobs. Joby also has the partnership with the USAF (through Agility Prime) which lends them further credibility with the public. Also with the Biden admin comes a lot more focus on **G R E E N Energy.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Team -\n\n\nLastly I leave you with this incredibly insightful (and thoughtful) review from a current employee at Joby. If you've made it this far you probably want to name your kid Joby too. **This is the way**. I am pasting the review here (in addition to linking the review on Glassdoor) so you don't have to sign in! Love to hear your thoughts :) ...hopefully I cobbled all my crazy together and put together a decent first-ever public DD!\n\n\"Joby Aviation is an amazing place to work. Is is a young company with a huge heart, comprised of a world-class team that is vigorously clawing its way up a steep mountain to achieve a truly great purpose. That purpose is to provide an air taxi service that radically transforms peoples lives by giving them back their precious time while also helping heal our planet by reducing carbon emissions. Joby is much more of a tight-knit family competing in an all-terrain adventure race against the clock than it is a typical global aerospace company. From my observations, Joby is not for everyone. They require individuals who get excited about being responsible for producing a lot with a little. They require people who embrace decision making, ownership, hard work, and simply get excited about tackling hard problems\u2026 daily. People who have a passion for what Joby is doing and why they are doing it thrive in this fast-paced environment. Those that excel are doers, tenacious, amazingly resourceful, and uncanny in how they find ways to make progress and provide value, oftentimes with limited direction. They somehow put aside their ego and jump in with an eagerness to help wherever they can, sometimes below their pay grade and sometimes above. Competing in an all-terrain adventure race with limited course markings that requires you to collaborate with your teammates and push with everything you\u2019ve got, and to do it in a ridiculously short amount of time, that is hard. That is crazy hard. And that is why I say it's not for everyone. If you have what it takes and can truly align with their culture and mission, then you will likely get a lot of fulfillment from working there. It will likely be one of the hardest places you\u2019ve ever worked but also one of the most rewarding. As they race forward on commercializing their audaciously advanced and safety driven airplane, they are also building a new company in the process. And I can attest that it can get a little messy at times. The focus right now is to solve immense engineering challenges and get the vehicle certified so they can get into operations to provide a safe and reliable service. Successfully solving these complex and highly integrated engineering challenges is a masterful feat on its own. And to get such a system certified is not only incredibly difficult, but it is something even the FAA hasn\u2019t seen before and is requiring immense collaboration to work through all of it. Joby's leadership team recognizes they have a 6 DOF rubrics cube in front of them and they know they don\u2019t have everything figured out just yet. They build detailed plans to solve it all but not surprisingly, they don\u2019t always go to plan. It is quite difficult to follow a path that doesn\u2019t exist and understandably, this can frustrate those who have never worked in a highly developmental tech startup before. The leadership team is not perfect. Like all humans, there is room for improvement at all levels. But they are relentless in continually refining the plan while also adding incredible talent to help inform and execute to that plan. Even with these deficiencies and setbacks, their dogged determination drives them to forge on. They are relentless in their pursuit of their worthy goal and because of the amazing people they have on the inside and the outside, they believe they will succeed. And where do I stand amidst all of this? I too deeply believe we will succeed. I see issues with our plan and have my own skepticism at times. Where needed I raise my voice, speak out, and share my constructive solutions - something encouraged no matter what level you are at in the company. Will we find out our design has flaws and experience future setbacks? Yes. Will we breeze through the FAA certification process? No. But we will make it to the finish line, just watch us. For those who stick it out to the end, those covered in quarry dust and battle scars, we will stand atop the mountain of success wooting, high-fiving, and hugging the breadth out of each other. And to all those who believed and to those who did not, we will wave to you equally from atop that mountain. We will wave a joyful, happy wave of true genuine Joby love. But sadly, you will not see our wave because that mountain top is just too dang high! It is these special characteristics, the world-class team, the family-like culture, and the insane vision that formulate my belief on why Joby is an amazing place to work. We certainly have our issues but the positives are overwhelming and is what keeps me going, what keeps me putting my heart and soul into helping our team achieve our grandiose goals and mission. ***It is the journey and the destination that are too great to not be a part of***.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources -\n\nAgility Prime Program: [link](https://agilityprime.com/#/)\n\nLEAPTech: [link](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/Features/leaptech.html)\n\nMarina CA Factory: [link](https://cityofmarina.org/946/Environmental-Documents)\n\nAmazing eVTOL News Article: [link](https://evtol.news/joby-s4/)\n\nJoby Patents: [link](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/joby-aero-inc)\n\nUseful Patent Analysis: [link](https://evtol.news/news/inside-jobys-unicorn-flight-tests-and-patents-reveal-new-details)\n\nGlassdoor Review: [link](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Joby-Aviation-RVW35698810.htm)\n\nDisclosure: 300 commons @ $14.10 (but price doesn't even matter because I'm going to keep adding, through DA, through merger, through this dip, through the next one, until I'm gone or Joby is...

        "selftext": "I've been seeing General Electric popping up in the news quite a bit recently. There's some ideas they're playing around with that gives me hope that there will be a steady rise in stock value the way. Here's what I've gathered so far:\n\n1. First off, right at the beginning of the year, an article came out on the New York Times about the massive wind turbine  Haliade-X  they've built in the Netherlands. This monster is the size of two 2 football fields and can power a small city. This is lead model for a series of more turbines in the works to come. Just look at this beast of a [windmill](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/business/GE-wind-turbine.html).\n2. On that note, The Motley Fool put out this article yesterday announcing G&amp;E's plan to set in motion construction of their  [V236-15.0 MW model](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/12/ges-rival-vestas-launches/) and they too seem to think it could look like a rise is on the way. Also, I don't know about you guys, but renewable energy is pretty dang cool to me. \n3. They have also announced some really exciting news for the automobile industry. Yes, flying cars are about to be real. \"The [EV600 electric van](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/gm-unveils-ev-van-as-part-of-new-commercial-unit-fedex-first-customer.html) is scheduled to go on sale later this year through a new commercial business unit of GM\u2019s called BrightDrop. The division is planning a full portfolio of electric products, not just vehicles, [including a delivery pallet that was unveiled Tuesda](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/gm-shares-hit-record-high-on-electric-van-and-flying-car-potential-plans.html)y\" (CNBC). Now they look like inflated helicopters and I don't think it will be a revolutionary model, but it will certainly peak investor's attention. \n4. As of me writing this, [Larry Ramer](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/general-electrics-power-and-renewables-units-are-surging-2021-02-10) of *InvestoPlace* has held a long standing position in G&amp;E. He notes their projects moving forward will be a crucial step to leading our goals to eliminate the use of coal in the U.S. by 2033. I am willing to bet this factor alone will mean a significant rise in G&amp;E's stock within the upcoming 10 years. \n5. There's a decent amount of analysts recommending to [buy the stock right now.](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=ge)\n6. Yesterday, they also announced a partnership with Intel to expand the use of renewable energy in Portland. *Environmental Energy Leader* reports  that \"In 2020, PGE and Avangrid Renewables\u00a0[announced](https://portlandgeneral.com/news/2020-02-11-portland-general-electric-and-avangrid-renewables-announce-major)\u00a0the development of a 162-megawatt solar facility \u2013 the largest in Oregon \u2013 to meet the needs of\u00a0[17 Green Future Impact subscribers](https://portlandgeneral.com/news/2019-08-21-sustainability-leaders-claim-pges-green-future-impact-in-record). That project is expected to come online in late 2021.\"\n\n**Cons**\n\nHere's a quick list of some things that do concern me about the companies outcome:\n\n* Portland General Electric has a bit of notoriety when it comes to power outages. \n* General Electric [had to lay off many employees at the start of COVID-19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-cut-aviation-workforce-as-coronavirus-grounds-airliners-11584972724), a factor that indicates the companies lack of preparation to crisis. Laying off masses of employees is also very bad PR and it seems to have played in important role to the companies drop in price when the pandemic hit. \n* There's also a LOT of outrage about their [25% cut of aviation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-cut-aviation-workforce-as-coronavirus-grounds-airliners-11584972724) jobs back in May of 2020 for the same reasons explained above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, I think the good news outweigh the bad ones for G&amp;E. I think it looks really promising especially considering what they have been able to work on during this year. As of now, I only have 2 shares because I am out of a job, but I plan to go back to work soon and do look to buy more when my next paycheck comes in the mail. What are you guys' thoughts? Is there something I'm overlooking about the company or would you agree with me?",

        "selftext": "I know we\u2019ve had our fun with GME and I\u2019m sure it still has a shot to go up. However, let me re-introduce you to a real stock: **AMD**. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAt $88 a share, we\u2019re looking at massive upside. And instead of buying GME at $83, why not buy something that actually has some long term value? Oh and did I mention it\u2019s one of the most shorted stocks this month? [https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks)\n\n**That\u2019s $6.7 billion in short interest.** That\u2019s larger than the actual current market cap of GME. Let\u2019s actually make a dent here. These fuckers **added 17% more shorted shares** in the last month. You're gonna tell me their diamond hands are better than OUR DIAMOND HANDS \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e?\n\nAs our savior Elon Tweeted today : \u201cI am become meme, destroyer of shorts.\u201d\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993)\n\nLet\u2019s make him proud.\n\nOk, now for some DD so you guys know I\u2019m not talking out of my ass.\n\n# Fundamentals:\n\nTheir latest ER:\n\n**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**\n\n**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**\n\nServer revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.\n\nMassive increase in guidance. They\u2019re **expecting 37% growth** this year.\n\nSo why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let\u2019s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.\n\nObviously, we\u2019d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you\u2019re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, \u201chey we have too many orders and we can\u2019t keep up sorry, we\u2019ll get it to you ASAP\u201d\n\nImagine thinking this company isn\u2019t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.\n\nOur queen, Lisa Su, said \u201cthere will be added capacity\u201d in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they\u2019ll be good to go. I wouldn\u2019t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.\n\n**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**\n\nIntel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!\n\n**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.\n\n**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.\n\n# Technicals:\n\nFor those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.\n\nWe really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we\u2019re basically there right now.\n\nIn addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47\n\nFor more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.\n\n# Conclusion/TLDR:\n\nMy point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now it\u2019s time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions? Leave em in the comments and I\u2019ll answer.\n\n**Positions: 4/16/2021 100c, 97.5c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nThis is not financial advice.

        "selftext": "TLDR: INTC options are much cheaper and have a higher ROI than competitors options. Intel is having a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced. \n\nLast week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short/medium/long term investment. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points (go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis). \n\nToday I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC's short term option play.  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINTC options 65$ strike expiring February 26th (1 week of gametime) are the move. The main reason for the 65$ strike is that the volume and open interest is high so transacting these contracts is easy and the  ask/bid gap is very small (in this case .37/.36) **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast price for this option contract was at .36$ \\* (100) = 36$ per option contract\n\nAs of market close and after hours INTC shares are trading at 63.06$  or 3.08% way from being in the money. Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry (justified and for more than one reason), and given Intel's market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts, (which I outlined in my previous post) I find \"beating\" this option contract a more than 50% probability. \n\nTo illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67$ by Friday (2$ in the money) and my current position of 50 contracts. \n\nFor every dollar above 65$ my contracts are worth 5k$ so at 67$ they would be worth 10k$. Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36$ per option contract it would cost you 36\\*50= 1800$. The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555% (10,000/1,800) . To reach 67$ from the current price it would require a 6.24% increase in INTC stock price. \n\nReiterating, 3.08% up to be in the money and 6.24% up for ROI of 555%.\n\nNow I would like to show you the price/return potential for other companies in the space. \n\nFan favorite AMD closed trading at 89.48$ per share. Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3.08% increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92.25$. Options for 92$ closed last price at 78$ per contract and options at 92.5 at 63$, average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92.25$ would be and it comes to 70$ per option contract. This makes AMD weekly options 94.4% more expensive than INTCs. To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500$ and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6.24% would bring AMD to 95$. Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92.25$ contracts you would have 13750$ and an ROI of 393%. **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize (feel free to check and correct my math). \n\nMicron: 3.08% upward move contracts &lt; 90$ (they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94.4 to be precise) with an ROI at a 6.24% upwards move of 244%.\n\nTSM: 3.08% upward move contracts last price would be at around 83$ (volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask/bid and would likely be higher than 83$) with an ROI at a 6.24% move of 518%. Also looks attractive but the ask/bid gap is quite high and low volume/open interest.\n\nI wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low. Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well, but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other. The IV (Implied volatility is lower).  The premiums are lower because the contract writers don't expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others. My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be. Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week INTC closed up 1.6%, Micron was up 1.95%, AMD down 4.8%, and TSM down 3.6%. This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction. As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets. The week before this one  INTC closed up 4% and YTD INTC is up 26.2%. \n\nGiven the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically, I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher, and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks (although still very low). The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand. These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the \"real\" volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues. Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite. \n\nSimilar things happen in sports betting. A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog. Intel is the underdog of this story, and an underdog with very high expected value. You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you (so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks). \n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year (odds at +750). They probably wont win the championship and I don't see much value in that bet at the moment, but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at +5000 Id snag them up. This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market. \n\nI am a degenerate. There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub, a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world. I like to gamble and so do you, but more than gamble I like to make money. I like to win and I do win. \n\nI have 50, 65$ INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday, 500 contracts at 80$ strike for April 16 , as well as 1700 shares long. I believe in this play in the short term and long term. \n\nFor the short term, a long shot bet, but not nearly as much as the option writers have them. \n\nThis is deep fucking value.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**",

The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--&gt; This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20\n\nWell, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--&gt; Very technical.

It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&amp;LangLocaleID=1033&amp;Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

EVs, phones, laptops, gaming consoles, fridges, thermostats, doorbells, toasters - i dont know - everything.  \n\n\"The Semiconductor Industry Association [said in December](https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-increase-6-percent-year-to-year-in-october-annual-sales-projected-to-increase-5-1-percent-in-2020/) that global chip sales would grow 8.4% in 2021 from 2020\u2032s total of $433 billion. That\u2019s up from 5.1% growth between 2019 and 2020\"\n\nThat was before Biden's announcement that he will be [signing an executive order to address the chip shortage.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) Looking primarily at US companies.\n\nBiden recently announced that he is fearful of China's control of the semiconductor market [And that he will look at US companies for military functions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/biden-to-order-supply-chain-review-to-assess-us-reliance-on-overseas-semiconductors.html).\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/07/30/why-semiconductor-chip-making-based-u-s-critical/5536083002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/07/30/why-semiconductor-chip-making-based-u-s-critical/5536083002/)\n\n**Why $ON?**\n\nThey make a large array of different components that fit throughout the electronic market.  Unlike AMD or INTC or CRSR - $ON produces components for automotive, personal, medical, cloud, and aerospace and defense.\n\nAll of these are important - but the last bit is an important focus.  Because again - Biden is scared of China, and wants to move to become more independent of their chip makers.  \"The White House plans to review gaps in domestic manufacturing and supply chains that are dominated by or run through \u201cnations that are or are likely to become unfriendly or unstable.\"\n\nChina's biggest semi conductor company TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.) currently sits with a market cap of $588.98B. $ON is at $16.70B.  TSMC's hegemony over the semiconductor market is hardly surprising, considering that it makes silicon for industry bigwigs such as Apple, Nvidia, and AMD and soon to be INTEL as well.\n\nWell - that was the case - until biden steps in and starts giving incentives to use US semi's and gives companies like $ON $$$$ to expand production capabilities.   Thats a lot of potential clients and revenue.\n\nLONG - this company will do very well.\n\nSHORT TERM - it will see steady growth.  Although - I believe this company will explode as soon as any real steps are taken under biden's initiative.  \n\nDisclaimer \n\nI'm in for 50k April 16calls at 41strike\n\nI am an idiot, and all this is BS that I think sounds great! So if you think so too, we might get along.",

        "selftext": "As a heavy investor in $ZNTE, I'm sure I was not the only one rattled last night by the rumor of Lilium also being in talks with $QELL. Then again, there is no such thing as a 'sure thing' in this space, so I should have known. However, that rumor prompted me to take a look at other potential eVTOL targets for $ZNTE (and any other eVTOL focused SPAC), and I'm liking what I found. The same article that covered Lilium and $QELL (below) also mentioned that Volocopter was looking to SPAC. \n\n[https://evtol.com/news/joby-announce-billion-spac-deal-lilium-others-follow-banner-month-evtol-industry/](https://evtol.com/news/joby-announce-billion-spac-deal-lilium-others-follow-banner-month-evtol-industry/)\n\n&gt;Volocopter, the other major German eVTOL developer, is also said to be in talks to go public via a reverse merger. Company CFO Rene Griemens [previously told eVTOL.com](https://evtol.com/features/lilium-reportedly-seeking-public-investment-spac-high-stakes-electric-air-taxi-makers/) that he considered SPACs to be a \u201cgreat financing option for our industry.\u201d\n\nAnd so there my Volocopter DD began...\n\nAfter more than 1000 test flights and almost ten years of experience, the VoloCity is one of the furthest developed and safest air taxis in the world. They are already living mobility of the future and are working with partners who are leaders in their industry. Along with Fraport AG, operator of Frankfurt Airport, and the German Air Traffic Control (DFS), Volocopter is working on how to integrate flight taxis into the day-to-day operations of international airports, including ground and passenger safety.\n\nHere is the company's historical timeline: \n\n**2011: VOLOCOPTER WRITES AVIATION HISTORY**\n\n* The worldwide first manned flight of an electrically powered aircraft. Our \u201cVC1\u201d and proof of concept on an airfield near Karlsruhe.2016: THE VOLOCOPTER IS GRANTED ITS PERMIT TO FLYIn its capacity as the world\u2019s first ever manned, fully electrical multicopter and in a country with one of the most strictly regulated airspaces worldwide.\n\n**2017: THE WORLD'S FIRST AIR TAXI**\n\n* World premiere in Dubai City: The Volocopter takes off on a test flight under the harshest climatic conditions.\n\n**2019: VOLOCOPTER FLIGHT AT HELSINKI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT:** \n\n* As part of the European SESAR Joint Undertaking Project, the Volocopter flew as a fully integrated part of air traffic at Helsinki International Airport.\n\n**2019: FIRST VOLOPORT PROTOTYPE DISPLAY**\n\n* The Volocopter flew over Marina Bay in Singapore and for the first time ever, the VoloPort Air Taxi support Infrastructure is displayed.\n\n**2019: VOLODRONE PRESENTED**\n\n* Volocopter expands its product portfolio with the heavy-lift cargo drone VoloDrone. Based on the technological platform of the Volocopter it can serve in the logistics, infrastructure, agriculture, and public service industries.\n\n**2019: DESIGN ORGANIZATION APPROVAL**\n\n* Volocopter is the first Air Taxi developer to be awarded SC-VTOL Design Organisation Approval by the European Aviation Safety Agency.\n\n# Volocopter Investors\n\n* Venture Round:\n   * Intel\n   * btov Partners\n* Series C\n   * Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., LTD (the Chinese automotive company that owns **Volvo, Lotus** and a number of other car brands)\n   * Daimler (**Mercedes-Benz**)\n   * btov Partners (also in Venture Round)\n   * MS&amp;AD Ventures\n   * DB Schenker\n   * TransLink Capital\n   * Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Company\n\n# The Volocopter Products\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[VoloCity](https://preview.redd.it/ji10ca7ek3h61.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9edcec277b5510139562c13c63024111b04eef82)\n\n# VoloCity\n\nThe VoloCity will become the first commercially licensed Volocopter, developed according to the high standards and requirements of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Our intensive testing program has shaped the innovative design and outstanding overall performance of the VoloCity. Quiet, safe, and comfortable, the VoloCity engenders Urban Air Mobility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Safe:** Volocopter features multiple redundancy systems, ensuring a virtually failsafe aircraft. The redundant systems include rotors, electric motors, batteries, avionics, and display. All communication networks are connected by fiber optic cable \u2013 'fly by light' so to say.\n* **Simple:** Flying has never been this easy. This is because state-of-the art assistance systems and more than 100 microprocessors ensure perfect stability and control of the Volocopter. Altitude control, balance, and landing can be intuitively managed by control stick. Even when the pilot lets go of it, the Volocopter automatically holds its position.\n* **Quiet:** Because all 18 rotors acoustically operate within a narrow frequency range, to the human ear they sound only twice as loud as one single rotor. For comparison: A Volocopter 2X within a 75-meter distance is as quiet as the smallest helicopter within 500 meters distance.\n* **Versatile:** The Volocopter sets new benchmarks not only in terms of reliability and simplicity but also in terms of cost-effectiveness. Fuel is replaced by economical (and increasingly eco-sustainable) electricity. The absence of complex mechanical components means that requirements for maintenance, repair, and overhaul are reduced to a minimum.\n* **8 Years Of Flight Experience:** Volocopters have been flying since 2011. The experience of more than 1,000 test flights makes the Volocopter what it is today: one of the most advanced and safe air taxis worldwide. Volocopter has already received permits to fly in manned or unmanned configurations for pioneering test flights in Germany, Dubai, Helsinki, and Singapore.\n* **Charging:** Nine rechargeable batteries power 18 motors. The Volocopter battery swapping system enables careful charging. Volocopter air taxis can be supplied with a newly maintained and charged battery shortly after landing and are ready for take-off again in a matter of minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img lopmz9ubk3h61...*\n\n# The VoloPort\n\nThe integration of flexible take-off and landing infrastructure in megacities is crucial for the success of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and for air taxi operations. In order to advance the development of this infrastructure, we have been working with Skyports, a British vertiport developer and operator, since 2019. Together we developed the VoloPort, which we will show for the first time publicly in Singapore.

Together we are building Volocopter\u2019s proprietary intelligent and integrated \u201cUrban Air Mobility Software Platform\u201d that will run on Microsoft Azure: VoloIQ. It offers complete digital visibility of the complex UAM ecosystem in real-time. VoloIQ is the digital backbone for enabling the whole Volocopter Urban Air Mobility Services ecosystem and serves as the brain for our air taxi services.\n\n**The Six Core Components**\n\n1. **Seamless User Integration**: Seamless user integration gives customers simple, easy-to-use options for booking their VoloCity flights. This component allows third parties to integrate their digital platforms for a full, seamless customer experience. So, taking the next cab or e-Scooter from the VoloPort will be as smooth as it gets.\n2. **Smart Infrastructure Management**: VoloIQ optimizes infrastructure usage of decentralized battery management facilities and our cost-efficient, low maintenance VoloPorts.\n3. **Data Acquisition, Enrichment, and Connectivity**: Data from ground and air-based sensors are collected and combine to allow for connectivity and updates for safe, insightful data-driven decision making for autonomous flight.\n4. **Cloud-Based, Service-Oriented Architecture**: Powered by Microsoft Azure, VoloIQ\u2019s design is safe, robust, and made for efficient scalability worldwide.\n5. **AI-Driven Fleet Service And Management**: The virtual representation and predictive maintenance used by VoloIQ knows when a Volocopter needs to have the next check-up etc. This ensures continued airworthiness, reliability, and as a result, longer-lasting aircraft.\n6. **Scaled Digital Flight Operations:** By enhancing in-flight safety and network usage for dynamic flight routing in lower shared airspace, VoloIQ automates and optimizes Urban Air Mobility infrastructure, routing, and operations to ensure that as many of us as possible can enjoy air taxi rides, all while setting the benchmark for a positive user experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My conclusion:** I am now extremely bullish on Volocopter. At this point, I'm actually torn between whether I'd rather have Volocopter or Lilium. Lilium definitely has better PR and brand recognition, but I am confident if $ZNTE does target Volocopter, after minimal research, the market's response will be extremely positive. \n\n**Position:** 780 Commons and 500 Warrants. Added more commons today on the dip after doing this DD.",

        "selftext": "I posted this to the Og reddit as well so forgive me.\nI'm stuck in the snow and figured I'd do this now. I have articles saved on my pc I'll post to support this later. My DD is based on articles and the general energy of my coworkers. Disclaimer* I work for Intel and I love it and I have to point out my views are my own and do not represent Intels*. So to jump in  Intel has a history of being shit on by institutions and have usually Outperformed revenue estimates. There's been several record breaking quarters especially since covid. Now the first topic I would like to bring up is foundry fabs. These fabs exist to build miscellaneous IC chips for customers, in toy cars, alarm systems, and the like. Back during the onset of covid, Bob Swan wrote a letter to the dod explaining the need for a DOD backed foundry plant in the US to combat China. The primary purpose is to build secure micro electronics under the complete auspices of the US military. This would cement INTEL as the defacto chip supplier for the US and its military allies,, in the ban on Chinese companies electronic devices down to contracts being voided if there was a single Chinese built security camera. This also means labor would be subsidized in part. https://evertiq.com/news/48238 . The second part I would  like to bring up is Intel has a new CEO starting tomorrow. For those that want a sense of who he is, listen to Intel last earnings call https://www.intc.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/8508/q4-2020-intel-corporation-earnings-conference-call . The man has a PLAN. He studied under the greats of intel. Royce Moore and Grove, I'm pretty sure it was all 3 but I could be wrong. He rise through the ranks from technician to CTO. His rise was metoric. He is the hope of Intel. He was shaping intels culture in its heyday, he knows how to recreate the Intel of old. The third point I would like to bring up is Intel recent purchase of Israeli company Habana Labs. They are producing a chip that allows machine learning to occur with GPU's at 20% faster than invidia can. (Disclaimer I might be misquoting the article and over simplified it)   No one has been able to make a dent in  Nvidia like this before.  Not the article that I had in mind but here's one https://newsroom.intel.com/news/aws-leverages-habana-gaudi-ai-processors/#gs.szvwf3 . Now coupled with a separate Intel circuit board that allows better interconnection and data transfer speeds between AI modules allowing for more efficient processing and a huge increase in data processing speeds. Again not the article but it gives some insight https://www.theregister.com/2019/12/17/intel_habana_buy/ .  In essence, Intel will corner the AI market, even if they don't have process leadership. They can dominate in how things connect together and communicate.  Now the last topic is the loss of product leadership. It matters.......to a point. How we classify our chips ie, 7nm 5nm and the like is kind of archaic. What actually matters is transistor density. It doesn't matter that you can build chips at 7 or 5nm and can't use all the space. Intel has a track record (sorry for using that phrase alot.) Of having a higher transistor density than its competitors. https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/21/is-smaller-always-better-in-chips-intels-new-10nm-superfin-technology-suggests-otherwise/ but I couldn't find articles simple enough for me to understand to fully support or disprove this, so take it with a grain of salt. The second part of this is Intels manufacturing capabilities. Theres a shortage of Intels competitors chips. Tsmc can't build what amd needs to actually make a dent in intels revenue stream. The same goes for NVIDIA but imo to a lesser degree. The third part of this is the massive shortage of IC chips in general,  in particular the auto industry. This means Intel will hit 70 within a few weeks for sure. This also means IMHO there's no end price target I could think of, I would gage, depending on how the new ceo behaves. Hopefully charismatic and daring. I love Intel and working here. I'm not giving investment advice, im just betting on a few hair brained ideas and the innovation and Indomitable spirit of the people I work with. You should see the grit and the ideas that are being sprung forth. Also for the simple fact we do not associate ourselves with forced labor in our supply chains (except TSMC) And in my opinion more change has happened recently in the last few months than the last few years. Bob Swan did great with what he knew how to do. He gave Intel cash and was the bad news bear so the new CEO could have a clean record. Tear me a new one guys tell me I'm autistic.",

        "selftext": "Didn't qualify as a Loss post so have to post as Disussion. \n\nFirst time:\n\nBought INTC at around March 2020 for a price of $51 per share. Idea back then was pandemic lockdown coming, everything was shifting online, 5G just started to popularize, thought that 5G &amp; gaming could have a go. Was thinking among TSM, NVDA and INTC and finally chose TSM and INTC as the Big 2 Battle (really should have bought NVDA!).\n\nWatched INTC climb to around $60 then this sucker announced in July 2020 it had to delay its 7nm production. Shares slumped to $47-$48. 23% loss over one week. Took it three months to finally climb back to over $52 in October 2020. Sold my shares with minor profits plus tiny bits of dividend.\n\nSecond time:\n\nINTC had major reshuffling across Nov.2020 to January 2021 and the new CEO talked a good game. Thought that INTC had a bit of a \"catch-up\" play ahead. Re-entered INTC at around $58 in early January 2021. Saw the price climb to $62 on Jan.20 2021. Then some hacker hacked into the company's database and exposed part of the financial data and the company was forced to release 2020 Q4 reports early (not a great report anyway, net profit dropped 15% YoY). Took another two weeks for shares to recover to $60. Sold at $59. Again negligible profits.\n\nYes I did earn some breadcrumbs in these two trades but overall I consider it a loss since these two big ass black swans grabbed the big piece of bread from my hand.\n\nBut three times might be a charm. I am planning to enter INTC again and see if Karma is on my side this time.",

        "selftext": "Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist.\n\nI'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about.\n\nAnd for **full disclosure** even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: **I do technically own some INTC** but it's only **2 shares**, [yes 2 shares](https://imgur.com/a/vv3Yi6k). \n\nSo as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first.\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\n# Cons\n\nBefore we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I\u2019m gonna list them first then address each one:\n\n\\- Management\n\n\\- Production issues\n\n\\- Competitors\n\n\\- The x86 architecture is getting old\n\n# Management\n\nI think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a\u2026 well\u2026 pretentious follower that doesn\u2019t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts.\n\nIt\u2019s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn\u2019t have kept it alive much longer.\n\n# Production issues\n\nIntel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn\u2019t go as planned and they still didn\u2019t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they  absolutely needed to stay competitive.\n\n# Competitors\n\nIf you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn\u2019t be challenged, the time has finally come. \n\nApple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it\u2019s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that.\n\n# The x86 architecture is getting old\n\nWe have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD.\n\nThe crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore\u2019s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don\u2019t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let\u2019s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production.\n\nARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores.\n\n# Pros\n\nFinally! We\u2019ve reached the pros, again like the cons I\u2019m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them:\n\n\\- Management\n\n\\- Brand\n\n\\- Production issues\n\n\\- Competitors\n\n\\- Architecture &amp; support\n\nYes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment\n\n# Management\n\nNot much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can\u2019t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks.\n\nGelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I\u2019m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia):\n\n&gt;Gelsinger was the architect of the original [Intel 80486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486) processor.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-:0-2) As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference [Intel Developer Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Developer_Forum) as a counterpart to [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)'s [WinHEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Hardware_Engineering_Conference). In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-5)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to [Steve Ballmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer) as CEO of [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft).[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-6)[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-7)[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-8)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-9)[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-wsj1-1) A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of [Third Point Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Point_Management) to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-:0-2)\n\nAnd he\u2019s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. \n\nIt\u2019s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&amp;D does take time, even Su didn\u2019t save AMD in one day.\n\n# Brand\n\nWhile it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone.\n\n# Production issues\n\nLet\u2019s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should\u2019ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can\u2019t keep up with the demand.\n\nThis move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits.\n\nI still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though.\n\n# Competitors\n\nThis is tricky, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually a pro per se but I\u2019m gonna put it here anyway. \n\nAMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don\u2019t want to go for the kill.\n\nWith the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support.\n\n# Architecture &amp; Support\n\nYes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let\u2019s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple\u2019s\n\nSo, while old x86 still has the edge, for now. \n\nBUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this.\n\nThere is also another road, RISC-V, it\u2019s showing promising results and it\u2019s open source.\n\nAnyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee.",

        "selftext": "Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,  who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant  transposition of truck plans ready for production.\n\nFIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV companies. So what  gives?\n\nAfter doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n\u200b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.

Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings.

I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.\n\n\u200b\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***  \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**.

The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n\u200b\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\***\\*\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n\u200b\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d  Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n\u200b\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors!\n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s  American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say  there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut  after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like  everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\nDisclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice.

        "selftext": "Hi  all, NrdRage here.  You might remember from such recent hits as \"buy   $PLTR 25p's as it's ripping here\", \"$CLNE June 13c's are literally free   money\", \"sell your $NCLH leaps in the 33 area and buy back later the   next day near 29\" (you're welcome, btw, as that trade probably saved   your week) and \"$NVDA June 580c's are going to make you rich\".  Today   we're gonna talk about the semiconductor chip space.\n\n# Fluff content\n\n\"B...b....b.....BUT   NrdRAGE, you called  $NVDA, you already talked about them!\"  I really   didn't.  Be honest, when I say chips/semis, the first things you think   of are $NVDA, $AMD, and $INTC.  Those are a wholly different thing than   what's on everybody's lips these days in relation to the vaunted   shortage, dealing in high performance silicon that is being produced at   full blast.  They're not going to be given a ticket to the feed trough   of free taxpayer money (supposing somebody informs Buyden that by chip    shortage, they're not indicating he needs to send his interns to  the   snack aisle of the grocery store to hoard.  Not a sure thing).\n\nWhat   we're going to be talking about are the lower grade ASIC (application   specific chips) that are used more in infrastructure.  These are the   commodity level products that are used for things like the computers in   vehicles, mobile phones, wireless towers, specialized digital binary   money mining, and so Elon can implant them in chimps for evil genius   mind control experiments.\n\n***Placeholder:  Chart for expected 5G tower growth***\n\n***Placeholder:  Chart for automotive chip demands and supply bottleneck; chart to Q3)***\n\nYour   bigger players here are going to be Taiwan Semi ($TSMC), Lam ($LRCX),   and ST ($STM).  2 of them are boring to trade, and Lam I'm not allowed   to talk about because of a conflict of interest w/ my VC.\n\n# Let's talk about the government for a minute\n\nOK,   be honest:  Half the reason you're here is because you heard Buyden is   going to dump loads of free money into these companies so they'll make   more chips.    After all, that's what CNBC has told you, and they  never  lie, right?  Right?  That's actually not what has happened in  Washington  (and, god help us, that line about Buyden thinking the chip  shortage  has to do with potatoes was only half joking).  What the  government has  done was signed up to spend money STUDYING why there's a  chip shortage.   The concern here is that even the US based semis  outsource out their  chip production to places like China and Vietnam,  and there's a growing  push to incentivize companies to bring production  domestically.  This is  especially spurred by $NXPI, who is  bottlenecking the automotive  industry by selling too much overseas.   Now, let's be honest:  It's  about 75% that all they do is waste money  on the study and never  actually make the investment, because getting  things like this done is  hard, and it's much easier to focus on social  issues that are already  covered by other laws but make it look like  something is getting done.   We have talkers and not doers right now,  that's just the nature of the  beast.\n\nSpeaking of, let's talk about....\n\n# $NXPI - The Laggard\n\n$NXPI   represents the only true foreign company we're going to examine today,   based in the Netherlands.  $MRVL is technically based in Bermuda, but   they're a US company (more on that later).  At the time of this  writing,  they're trading in the low 180's with a market cap of about 51  billion.   Their specialty is in chips that power infotainment systems  for cars.   So when you hear $F whine about how they can't get enough  chips,  they're low-key throwing shade at $NXPI.  The only reason  they're being  included in this list is because, as a big automotive  chipmaker, in  spite of the whole \"Buy American\" virtuing from the  current government,  if they spend money to ramp up manufacturing,  they're going to hand  money to $NXPI to set up factories here - and  will be dumb enough to not  make it contingent upon $NXPI keeping the  chips here in the country, so  they'll continue to sell them to the rest  of the world.\n\nLooking  under the  hood, 47% of their money comes from cars, another 13% comes  from  phones, 20% comes from infrastructure (think wireless towers) and  about  20% of their money comes from selling chips to AMazon and Google  so  their virtual assistants can spy on you and listen to your wife's   boyfriend having sex on your dining table, with his balls rubbing right   against where your plate of Hungry Man frozen dinners sits when ~~he takes her out on a date~~   she goes out \"with the girls\".  Hey, I think one of those peas fell on   the table.  Pick it up and put it in your mouth.  Yeah, roll it around   in there, tastes like taint, doesn't it?  They're b asically a smaller   representation of Trevor's nuts - or a life size version of yours, you   dirty little bitch.  So one could say they've got a pretty good  product  mix and were one of the earlier players in the sector to  recover (yet  still lagged behind them overall), unlike the other  players we're gonna  talk about later.    Or, you could say that they're  a bunch of flip  flopping non-committers who create a schizophrenic  company in some weird  attempt to not be cyclical.  They trade at a  lower multiple to their  competitors, but this is largely due to the  fact that they're leveraged  more deeply than the rest.  The best  comparison to these guys would be $TXN if  you want something else to  track it by\n\n**(Placeholder:  I might put a chart here later in an edit that compares price in relation to EBITDA)**\n\n**(Placeholder:    I might put a chart here later in an edit that shows forward earnings   estimations based upon the increase in auto and IoT chip costs)**\n\nWhat  do they think they're going to be long term?  That's the thing, it's  impossible to  tell if they're going to become a big player in cars or  IoT (they're not  compelling in infrastructure) because....\n\nWhat   makes $NXPI interesting here in spite of the fact that everybody is   pissed at them for spreading themselves too thin is the fact that   they're such whores with who they sell to that they've become something   of an interesting M&amp;A speculative play, as it's entirely possible a   company just comes along and buys them to bolster their supply chain  for  chips once and for all.  In particular, there is a strong  indication  that Samsung has been kicking the tires for over a year.\n\nOK, moving $ON (get it?  Dad joke)\n\n# $ON - The Overachiever\n\n$On   represents the only true domestic semi on this list, so if you're   playing the \"corporate welfare\" trade, you'll be interested here.  If   $NXPI is the BPD-afflicted ex who \"loves strongly and that's why she lit   your car on fire\", $ON is that super-focused new girlfriend who's   dating you because she knows somewhere in your contact list is a local   celebrity she can use to get her closer to being the Bachelorette after   she dumps your ass.  ON is all-in on 2 things:  the vehicle revolution   and 5G.  They're positioning themselves as the place to go to if you're   making EV's or autonomous cars, as they are focused on LIDAR sensory   chips and power management.  Why?  It's simple - ON was, is, and always   will be, interested in the highest margin businesses possible, cyclical   nature of them be damned.  Sure, they stick the tip of their johnson  in  the industrial sector, cross-selling their sensory chips for  purposes of  machine vision (think automated Amazon warehouse part  pickers), but  it's not something they spend a lot of time on.  Does  this strategy work  (at least for right now?).  Let's look under the  hood.\n\nThey  had a MASSIVE beat  last quarter and then upgraded forward guidance by  8%, and this stonk  has already had quite a run - more than 30% to date,  which has outpaced  its competitors by almost double.  The automotive  section of their  portfolio rose 17% and represents about 33% of their  revenue at this  point, but it's clear to see that if we have this  conversation in a  year, that number will be well over 50%.  Their  infrastructure revenue  (wireless towers) lagged, but that was due to  their vendors, and  actually represents a forward opportunity.  They beat  in spite of a  major part of their portfolio dumping.  So the answer is  yes.\n\nHow?    Simple:  Mind control and cancer technology from the lizard people   who's secret society is bustling under the ice of Antarctica, aka 5G.    The telecoms, as a result of the virus, really slowed down their rollout   of 5G last year.  It was suspected that might carry through this year,   as well.  You may have noticed the news a day or two ago that $T and  $VZ  caught downgrades because of unexpectedly high prices paid in the  most  recent bandwidth spectrum auctions.  That changes all of that.   Since  everybody had to pay so much more for the spectrum space, look  for these  players to be very aggressive in trying to shorten the ROI  frame on  those expenses by aggressively expanding out their 5G  infrastructure.   There are 3 companies that this is very good news for:   $SWKS (another  stock I can't comment on because of conflict of  interest, so do your own  DD with them), $ON, and the next participant  in this, which we'll get  to in a moment.  So there are about to be a  lot more chips from $ON in  your kid's school, shooting ovarian cancer  rays into that boy.  You  likely won't see this reflected on the balance  sheet until their Q3  earnings, but since everybody knows it's coming,  it's going to get baked  into the price.  Which is why you're very  likely to see a melt up over  the next months.\n\nThe   one thing that sets $ON apart from the rest of the equities on this   list is that they're not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they're not a   company that simply outsources chip production to other people   (overseas) and who has shown a willingness to keep some production in   house.  Matter of fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that he   wants to maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.  Which   means when it's time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer money to   build out US production, they'll have their hands out.\n\nTL:DR:    If you're bullish on EV's, self-driving cars, and the Illuminati,   you're bullish on $ON.  If you're playing the gubmint corporate cheese   play, $ON\n\n# $MRVL - The Duke Brothers\n\nMarvell   is functionally a US company (Santa Clara), but is technically   headquartered in Bermuda because they're filthy tax dodgers.  If you're   one of those \"ethical investors\", stay far away from this company,   because they're as dirty as they come in a lot of ways. They also trade   at a lower multiple than the others.  On the upside, if the government   starts offering money to \"Build American, sell to China\", they will   elbow their way to the front of the line to take the free money...and   then build a 3 person operation somewhere in Iowa that makes hard drive   chips and pocket the rest, which will definitely pad their bottom line.\n\nOne   thing that's different with $MRVL here is that they completely   outsource their chip production right now, so if they were to take   government money, they would have to build their infrastructure from the   ground up and figure out how to make it work.  Anyways, let's look   under the hood:\n\n40%  of their  revenue comes from the storage sector.  Meaning the lion's  share of  their money is legacy, selling chips that go in hard drives.   On the  consumer side, it's in platter discs, their SSD play is in the   enterprise space because they're not high performance chips.    BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-RIIIIIIIIING.   \"But NrdRage!\", I can hear you saying   \"That means they're gonna be huge in the cloooooouuuuuuud!\".   Sure,   except margins in t he cloud computing space keep shrinking at   exponential rates as it becomes more commoditized, so it's a lot like   investing in EMC in 2014.  They've invested heavily in automotive in the   last year, but they're a day late and a billion dollars short there.    It will take at least 3 years before that investment starts bearing   fruit, so they're not an interesting play in that aspect, and likely   would use that free taxpayer money to try and close their gap there,   because they weren't forward thinking in that regard.  They've been   active in acquisitions lately, most recently buying Inphi, which serves   to just attempt to keep up with $NVDA in the ARM chip space for data   centers.  For the record, they cannot keep up with $NVDA in that space,   so don't think you're paying for a dominant player there.    It's a  high  profit sector, but not exciting and dependent on their continued   contract winning in the whitebox space.  All this sounds like they're   big spenders, but that's not really true.  They've actually been   excessively cautious in leveraging debt, which is why they're so far   behind in the auto space.  As only 4 or 5% of their revenue came from   things like industrial or IoT, MRVL is actively winding down t hose   sectors of their business, and abandoning t hem.\n\nWhat   they are that's interesting, however, is almost exclusively a 5G play,   and in that regard, they are fucking rock stars.   5G alone represents   about a billion dollars per quarter as things get more heated there,   because they're not just a domestic 5G play - they're really well   positioned to be the dominant chip maker in both the Land of the Hentai   Sun and for the Europoors.  If you're investing in $MRVL, this is the   SOLE reason you're doing so, and it's a compelling case.  There's no   chart data I can provide as-yet that can accurately project their   positioning in the market in this area, but rest assured, when that data   can be quantified, they're going to be a big time player in it.   Matter  of fact, just yesterday they announced they were partnering with   Fujitsu in a 5G baseband agreement with regards to Fujitsu's base   stations.  Bad day to announce that news, since the best performing   stonks were the ones that only closed down 1%.\n\n**(Placeholder:  Chart goes here for 5G chip earnings and market share)**\n\n**(Placeholder:  Chart goes here for telecom expansion analysis)**\n\n# So, to summarize:\n\n* The   entire sector is very cyclical, and presently it represents a perfect   storm of an upgrade in telecommunications technology, automotive   advancements, and IoT\n* Don't   bet on them just because you hear Buyden is virtue signalling some   bullshit about solving Ford's chip crisis, because it's probably going   to be another example of lifetime politicians being all talk and no   action\n* They're   all healthy financially, none of them are heavily shorted, and  pressure  is to the upside, albeit not in any sort of extreme adrenaline releasing way\n* If   you really want to bet on government, the real bet here is the stimmy   money getting handed out again.  DC is basically telling everybody to  go  buy a new phone with the next installment of checks, and those  phones  are going to be 5G capable and the people are going to want to  leverage  that.\n* Don't tell the lizard people I know about their secret base\n\n# That's all well and good, fucker, but how do I play them?  Can I FD?\n\n$NXPI:    You actually can.  You can expect daily movement of between 2-4% with   some regularity, with a ITM Delta of about 58 and a Gamma approaching 2   and a half (spoiler alert: All these are going to have garbage gammas,   just a nature of the industry).  Don't go crazy out of the money, but   weeklies are absolutely something you can do here.\n\n$ON:    You can't really.  This is really more of a melt up play.  You don't   necessarily have to play leaps, but weeklies are gonna be a bad idea.    Stay close to in the money and go 2 or 3 months out at a time.    Currently I'm sitting on 4/16 41c's, which I will roll over into June   calls as we get closer to expiration.  You always want to stay a little   in front of these dudes.  ITM Delta is almost always sub-50 and Gamma  is  often times about 12 short term.  Stay a little ahead of them and it   improves dramatically.\n\n$MRVL:    They're OK there, but like $ON, you're probably going to want to stay   ahead of them, though you can fiddle with this a bit.  Delta is pretty   good, but the gamma is absolute dogshit.  If you target something about   10% one direction or another, you should be happy as long as you pick   the right side of the coin flip.\n\n# Outlook and Price Targets:\n\n$NXPI:    I'm neutral on them, bordering on bullish.  They're the biggest  reason  we keep hearing about this silicon crisis right now, but they're  being  coy about whether the reason they're not keeping up is because  they  don't or won't produce enough or if it's just because they won't  sell  enough to us.  They represent a potential speculative play if  somebody  who really needs chips for their business decides to just  solve the  problem by throwing money at it and bringing that development  in house.   3 month price target 200-210.\n\n$ON:    Bullish.  They're laser focused and well positioned to take advantage   of all the highest margin business in this cycle, and as the demand  for  these products ramps up, their outlook is going to exponentially  outpace  everybody else in the space, even the chips I didn't talk about  today  (exempting gaming chip makers).  45 in the short term, but if  you manage  to stick your dick in your wife when she's sleeping one  night and  dribble your Downs-afflicted swimmers into her, you could  very well see  75-80 by the time that chromosome hoarding bundle of joy  licks your  wife's vag.  I expect to see this one in triple digits at  some point.  A  darling.\n\n$MRVL:    Bullish for 5G ONLY.  Once you start seeing the telecoms advertise   they've got 97% nationwide 5G coverage (and research studies to back   that up), their cycle will be over and they'll go back to legacy   revenue, but expect big things from them as $T and $VZ try to keep up   with T-Mo's breakneck pace.  Short term price of $75, long term...eh,   whatever.\n\n# Positions:\n\n$NXPI:   I don't hold a position with them, and don't anticipate doing so  unless a strong momentum trade forms.  I think they can move, but  they're not interesting to me.  Some of you will like them, especially  since you can FD them because of the occasional spikes and craters.\n\n$ON:    1000 4/16 $41cs and 500 7/16 44c's.  I also have 85,000 shares at   30.59.  I grabbed some weeklies for next week at 38 during yesterday's   bloodbath, but that was just me feeling cute.  You can't really shadow   trade that since it's already back up to 40.25.\n\n$MRVL:  2000 5/21 $65c's and 50,000 shares at 33.35\n\n# NRDRAGE DOUBLE FEATURE:  BONUS \"DD\": $UTZ\n\nI   keep making those \"Buyden hears chip shortage and thinks Frito Lay is   in trouble\" jokes, but the thing is, I'm only half kidding.    That has   nothing to do with this equity other than it got me thinking about my   favorite snack brands.  A week ago, I had no idea this company was even   publicly traded -  I always knew them as a family run northeast niche   thing.  One thing I did notice, however, was a couple of years ago  their  chips started showing up in grocery stores near my Colorado  homes,  which I had been assuming meant they were having things shipped  from the  East coast.  And, when we spent a couple of weeks at our LA  home  recently so I could get in some motorcycle riding and away from  the  snow, I found them on the shelves out there, too.  Somewhere along  the  way, they decided to become a national brand and have started   penetrating markets all over the place.  I have no idea what their   financials look like or any other solid DD besides knowing that they're   fucking delicious and, if you're a believer in the product, then   believing in the company shouldn't be hard.  So I bought a thousand   shares at 24.35 in solidarity with them.  Then I saw Cramer hyped them a   couple of nights ago and cursed myself for starting to turn into a   shitty Boomer.  Maybe they become a big player in the snack food space   on their own, maybe a company like $PEP comes along and buys them out.    Regardless, if you like the product, go out and buy some equity, you  fat  fuck.  Plus, there's always a non-zero chance Joe gives them a  bailout  by mistake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my love,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChad Dickens",

        "selftext": "Hey r/stocks. I'm 21 years old, and still in school. I've had a couple good jobs/co-ops so I had a bunch of cash lying around and last August I decided to start investing in stocks.\n\nI'm doing an undergrad in computer science, I'm interested in tech/gaming, and my stock picks tend to reflect those things.\n\nI'm wondering if I should rebalance or invest more in index funds rather than individual stocks.\n\n# Portfolio:\n\n* **Nio** (23.13%): It's a high percentage for a pretty speculative stock, but I've been riding it up since 16.50, avg. buy-in is \\~22 (up 159%), I'm still bullish and I have no rebalancing strategy  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af The simplified reasons I bought are: **1)** EVs are the future **2)** Seems to have good backing from the CCP **3)** Everything I can find about the quality of the vehicles is very positive **4)** Not competing with the likes of Tesla because the whole industry is set for massive growth **5)** I think they're doing a good job at expanding production\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Crypto** (23%): **I know it's against the rules to discuss so I'm excluding specifics. I just wanted to include to give a better idea of my portfolio.** ^(0.11 BTC, 1.21 ETH)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **ARKG** (15%): Fairly recent investment (avg buy-in is 97.90, now it's 107.20) I don't have a great bullish argument because I know very little about Genomics, but I read a bunch of high-level stuff about how the technology has potential to cure certain diseases and be used cosmetically. I'm not a big fan of managed funds, but I figured ARK could pick companies better than an index fund could, since the field is so new. (Input on this would be appreciated)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **INTC** (8.25%): I bought in November at 45.84 (now 57.68 thanks to news of the new CEO) AMD is clearly winning the CPU war right now, but I felt that there's plenty of room for CPU growth (esp. with work-from-home and the processor shortage that COVID has given us) and that Intel can make a comeback if it gets its shit together. Seems they're making some effort to do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **SQ** (8.15%): Bought at 178 (now 228) Not a lot to say. All the regular stuff, but also their Crypto play must be doing well with all the growth of Bitcoin recently, and I'm thinking their small-business tap-to-pay things might see more use in 6-12 months when (knock-on-wood) Covid is mostly gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **AMD** (7.67%): Everyone knows the bullish case. They're dominating CPU, they're competitive with GPUs now too, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **MSFT** (3.86%): I'm kind of surprised it's a low percentage of my portfolio; maybe I'll buy more. Very stable company, it's like the gold of tech stocks. But there's plenty of future growth to expect: Azure, Xbox Gamepass, Teams, PowerApps. As well as the whole monopoly on good operating systems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Others** (&lt;3%): **ICLN**(2.5%), **SNE**(2.2%), **IVV**(1.5%), **VUN**(1.3%), **QQQ**(1.3%), **WMT**(1.1%) **|** A lot of these picks were stupid buys at the beginning of my buying stocks, and they were small purchases because I hadn't worked up the confidence to put any significant amount of money in stocks. I might liquidate most of these (not ICLN), but for now I kind of just ignore them.\n\n# Might buy soon:\n\n* **BB**: I might put some money into BB soon, as it dips post-GME-frenzy. The bullish argument seems good to me. I'm just not sure what is a good price to buy in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **RBLX**: I'm glad that they've opted for a direct offering instead of an IPO, so retail can get an okay price. I'm bullish just because they have a remarkable business model, where they profit off of users' creation. Their revenue growth is a testament to that. I always thought of roblox as a fad game, but it's really not, they've had so much growth in user-base in the last year (90M monthly 2019 to 150M monthly 2020) and most users are spending money on Robux so they can pay other users for new game modes, cosmetics, items, etc.. It's essentially a game-engine inside a game, marketed to teenagers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm also keeping about the amount of 30% of my portfolio in cash just-in-case of a big 2021 pullback. In that case, I'll likely just average it out into an S&amp;P 500 ETF. Stock-picking has done me well in this crazy run-up over the last year, but I wouldn't trust myself in a bear market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know if I'm doing anything stupid. I feel like just writing this out was a good exercise for me to make sure there's a reason to hold these stocks. Thanks a lot.",

        "selftext": "Intro: Over the past few months, there have been an increasing number of posts discussing the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. \n\nMy thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. \nTLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.",

With the recent shortage of chips due to car companies looking to EV and increased online activity due to covid. There is a huge shortage in the supply of chips and the demand only is increasing.\n\nBiden administration is gooing to write an executive order helping to fund certain companies.\n\n\n\nAMD and ON both blew past there earning the last quarter and are being poised for lift off.\n\n1. The new ramp up of need for chips in cars and pretty much everything. The US is actually in a shortage right now due to the increased demand. Car companies have actually estimated they will lose 2 billion dollars (per company) due to the shortages. The big companies that product these chips, AMD, INTC, and like 10 other companies got in a room and smoked some cigars and wrote a letter to Biden Administation asking for incentives to produce more chips. (Pretty much asking for money from the government). They asked for subsidiaries, grants, and tax credits. Making it easily more available to produce large quantities of chips.\n\nBiden's office said that they will be signing an executive order in the coming weeks to address the issue of the shortage of chips. most likely tax credits, or big ass grants to semiconductor producers and designers.\n\nHere is the adminstrations response [https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2.

Earlier this month, it was reported that Jia said he had sold his stake in Lucid Motors for several hundred million dollars. Lucid would be delighted to see the back of Jia and any lingering association with the troubled Faraday Future. However, a source close to Lucid says that reports of Jia selling his shares are probably untrue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2019 NO GRANT\n\nMeanwhile, development of the $60,000 Lucid Air has been proceeding well, and it was recently shown reaching 235 mph on a test track. However, Lucid has had its own setbacks, including abandoning attempts to design its own self-driving technology in favor of using a semi-autonomous system from Mobileye, now part of Intel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLucid plans to build an assembly plant in China, which would be financed entirely by local and regional government incentives. The site of its proposed U.S. factory, Casa Grande, Ariz., is being somewhat less generous. Lucid has a $1.5 million job-training grant from Arizona and is negotiating a further $5 million grant, according to a spokesperson for the state\u2019s commerce authority. It could also apply for a tax credit program worth up to another $40 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, the make-or-break loan for the $700 million facility would be a U.S. Department of Energy program to help build advanced-technology car plants. Tesla benefited from a $465 million DOE loan in 2010, while Ford secured one for $5.9 billion. But because the loan reimburses expenses rather than paying them up front, Lucid cannot move forward until it has financing in place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLucid began its fourth round of institutional fundraising earlier this year, with the help of investment bank Morgan Stanley. Ford\u2019s acquisition offer came as a surprise, said a source close to Lucid: \u201cThe bank approached Ford to see if they wanted to participate in the Series D.

Lucid started out ok as Atieva USA. They tried to move into building EVs. Finance was always the problem, no one would back them, or at least for long. Pulling up the compnays webpage, goes back to 2017. Mostly unchanged over the years. Same vague statements, promises, etc. Lucid only stays afloat by, for lack of a better word, tricking someone into financing them, or, money is government. Looks like they they got AZ caught in the trap. The only play they have is to try and get grant money. \"Lucid has a $1.5 million job-training grant from Arizona and is negotiating a further $5 million grant, according to a spokesperson for the state\u2019s commerce authority. It could also apply for a tax credit program worth up to another $40 million.\" This is after burning through BAIC and LeEco. Ford didn't bite. I cannot find the link for the life of me, but they do not qualify for the same type of grants Tesla got, they have already tried fed money. They ended up on Equityzen for bottom barrel, wile CCIV pushes them which brings us to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2019, they just aren't around. Didn't file any paperwork that I can find. !flag\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis stinks of a rotten kickstarter, make claims, more claims, then excuses, and more excuses. The same lines have been said for years. They were going to have cars rolling in 2018, nope. Lies, to provide jobs and all these wonderful things. Solar. Freakin. Roadways. But this gets them the grants to stay around a bit more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you had a SPAC going, it would be super nice if you could get the stock to somehow ramp up to an absurd level, so you can cash out. I mean, that would just be total luck if you knew you were going bust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think they have any vehicles other than their alpha prototypes that were made way back with BAIC. Every pic / story / article from the last 3 years are all identical. Most of the pics etc I can find are all renderings. I would wager that the \"alpha\" prototype, is from 2017, and it's the only damn thing they have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCall it good or bad, but they don't hold anything great for tech. They have failed at auto pilot pretty hard (if they are even bothering to try), and supposedly went with some MS product. I see they have some patents, but this is so.. so.. basic... There is literally nothing new about any of this one [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=10901019&amp;OS=10901019&amp;RS=10901019](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=10901019&amp;OS=10901019&amp;RS=10901019) it's just padded out with random crap just to secure a patent.

Every article or video, seems like they are surrounded by car shells and just painting them. I can't prove any of this. But I would wager that is one giant empty ass building.

        "selftext": "\\*Disclaimer, my IQ is very low and subhuman. This is not financial advice, in fact its more akin to a drunk dog howl.\n\n**Teradyne**\n\n**MASSIVE AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY DEMAND.**\n\nEverything requires semi-conductors now. The huge technology boom has led to an unprecedented increase in demand for semi-conductors:\n\n\\- Smart devices, cars now require massive processing power to compute automated \u201csmart/enhanced\u201d driving features. \n\n\\- Car media technology is no longer just analog, everything is Digital.\n\n\\- Consumer devices are \u201csmarter\u201d than ever. Speakers, headphones.\n\n\\- \u201cConnected\u201d devices running on networks are growing more complex, 5G is a good example. \n\nEven without covid **supply cannot keep up**. All the major electronics companies are in a race to build new factories and update to the latest equipment.\n\nTeradyne Provides the **AUTOMATION** equipment for almost all of them. \n\n* 50% Of semi conductor tests are $TER\n* Biggest customers \n   * Intel\n      * 7 Billion new factory 2020\n   * TSM\n      * 12 Billion new factory 2020\n   * Samsung\n      * 25 Billion new factory 2020\n* The biggest issue with semi-conductors has always been a shortage of supply due to whatever reason.\n* New Technology Paradigms that could force rapid production development.\n   * Automotive technology explosion\n   * 5G technology explosion\n   * Space technology Growth\n* Shortage of supply for existing products\n* By the numbers:\n   * Industrial automaton sales declined in 2020 due to covid\n   * 43% Growth in System Test segment\n   * 10% Growth in 5G segment. Expected to ramp up in 2021.\n* Large increase in capital expenditure to keep pace with growth of client demands. (37%)\n* Relatively high EPS and revenue expectations\n   * Justified by the gigantic demand in semiconductor in the coming decade.\n   * Demand is not issue, massive amounts of expenditure needed to keep up with pace of industry. \n* 67% Growth in operating income\n* 33% Growth in gross profit\n* 64% Increase in EPS\n* 31% Increase in cash equivalents, 10% increase in liabilities\n* 50% Cash flow growth\n\n**Reflection on Sony**\n\n&gt;!Long term outlook still remains positive. Playstation 5 console sales will plateau, but licensure and sale off first party titles will increase as more titles are released. I believe PS5 will be the most profitable console generation yet from SNE. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!EV technology looks very promising, I suspect one of the Japanese car makers will swoop the technology up or a partnership deal will be announced in the future.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!SNE looks very competitive in the supplier niche for automotive, few other automotive suppliers come close in terms of cutting edge tech.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Electronics division regaining consistent growth is a good sign.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Pictures looks like it will be the next possible growth sector of the company with the purchase of crunchyroll, SNE might make a monopoly play in the anime streaming world, carving out a hefty niche.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I maintain overall that Sony is undervalued for the size and scope of the industry it is in. Very positive outlook on the near term and long term future. !&lt;\n\n**tl;dr** \n\n$TER is a good long term hold, semiconductors may be cyclical but I believe we're entering the growth territory where demand vastly exceeds supply. The amount of new tech needs lots of chipsets to fuel it's consumption and TER is happy to help manufacturers produce them. At 120$ price after earnings I will be purchasing a long position.\n\nI'll be cleaning this up when I have time.",

        "selftext": "Hey all, I'm very new to trading, had always  wanted to dive in but never really have the disposable income to do so.  \n\n\nI know it can be a risky move, especially for those who don't really have money to play with. But with apps like Robinhood making it a bit simpler to get into the game and buy/sell etc. I figured I'd finally try my luck.  \n\n\nNow I know there's some out there that can drop a few thousand into the market like it's nothing and move from there. However I'm not in that boat and so taking risky chances with what I do have to throw in on a chance that something will jump up is a harder decision for someone like me. At my current rate I figure I can throw in about $50 a week or so, and sometimes more depending on the money I have coming in.  \n\n\nI was wondering what some might think of the decisions I made, based on me assuming the companies I bought into being more 'safe bets' compared to some other options. The stocks I had bought, along with how much I put in (It will be added to and adjusted more evenly over time) are as follows:  \n\n\n**Skyworks (SWKS) - $5**  \n**Intel (INTC) - $5**  \n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $5**  \n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $5**  \n**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) - $30**  \n\n\nNvidia is the one I was most unsure on after buying it, but with what seems like everyone buying GPUs these days, along with a mining surge again, I figured it'd be an okay pick. Not necessarily looking for advice or any of that in the sense of making a bad investment based off of something someone may suggest. Just the thoughts on my choices and possibly adding more to these in the future.  \n\n\nOther options I had considered were Amazon, Apple, and Google. But was unsure on how they would react as the pandemic begins to disappear eventually.",

        "selftext": "With stock shortages on many different nodes from the likes of Samsung, TSMC and even Intel (which has a very dominate position in the server-space), there have been problems getting various products to market. Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can\u2019t sell their products due to the limits on chips designer\u2019s limits of wafers of a given process node.\n\nAs a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the \u201cbig fabs\u201d that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips.\n\nEssentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these \u201cbig-name\u201d computing technology companies that you\u2019re used to hearing about are.\n\nTSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.\n\nThis is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.\n\nEventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion\u2019s share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It\u2019s quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.\n\nAt the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.\n\nThere\u2019s already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other \u201cless sexy\u201d fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.\n\nIn general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.\n\nI recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.\n\n**This is not financial advice, I am \ud83e\udd8d and I am currently sauteeing crayons in a pan**",

        "selftext": "I have been a long-term investor of AMD over the past few years and I have been rewarded immensely for it. But a trend I have been noticing for the past half-year is that despite meeting and beating expectations and guidance, high-growth stocks in the semiconductor sector seems to have hit a wall in SP. In particular, I am not just referring to AMD but NVDA as well. On the contrary, stocks with higher earnings but lower growth seem to be regaining momentum, most notably Intel, MU, TSM and others.\n\nThis has led me to exit my AMD position and take a serious look at the stock market as a whole. Over the past half-year, there has been an unjustified exuberance in EV stocks. I don't think it takes much convincing to see that the SP of multiple EV stocks (most notoriously TSLA) seem to be out-of-whack with reality and future expectations.\n\nThis has led me to think that more rational investors are either exiting the market or moving into stocks with lower growth/risk. If the EV bubble is being propped up by inexperienced investors that are not trading in-line with fundamentals, then a market correction could easily accelerate into a crash for these stocks. And investors moving into low-risk stocks prior to a crash has precedence as well (dot-com bubble). \n\nOne more bit that has me thinking: The GME and related meme stocks seem to be crashing and the shorts and more rational investors seem to be regaining the upper hand. This could serve as a momentum for others to re-look their investments in very risky and overvalued assets. Could this be the trigger for the EV bubble popping?",

        "selftext": "Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I   wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,   who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant   transposition of truck plans ready for production.\n\nFIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV SPAC, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV SPACs. So what  gives?\n\nAfter doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,   the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  SPAC is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The AllStars](https://preview.redd.it/54vhxflk4ph61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e2263d0d4f7c3c116941204b78748f820e4c763)\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.\n\n**David Boris \u2013**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 SPAC  transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one SPAC that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img g7jukrvl4ph61...*\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***  \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**\n\n***Albert Li*** \u2013 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.\n\n***Benjamin Wu***  \u2013 15+ years \u2013 GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international  corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.\n\nSo  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent   connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other   places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV SPACs aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Only Class 1 - no other competition](https://preview.redd.it/qunxrcpm4ph61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82afea28956c20b131b2818a47689e32c050aca2)\n\nThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img j0g83din4ph61...*\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xzys0rmo4ph61...*\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img 88qdcsfp4ph61...*\n\n\u200b\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\*\\\\**\\*\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV   delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite   possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor   Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas.\n\nEDIT - Thanks to UkuleleJoe for pointing this out -  Pete Buttegieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory when he was a  presidential candidate last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Peculiar  section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County, VA   in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are  working on?](https://preview.redd.it/iahml2dq4ph61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40458e819d9b65b6d57efa102685f4f35892a49d)\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d  Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n\u200b\n\n[Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.](https://preview.redd.it/kw8urirr4ph61.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0378f103164d7df1f27dcc305307d2ca6b9a9847)\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV SPAC is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors! (CCIV  GANG IN THE HOUSE!! They are my #2 to my #1 baby here.  I'm sorry for  cheating on you FIII!!)\n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s  American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say  there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut  after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like  everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5bbf9ns4ph61.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc3eeb732d6f9791ead9074f990d93d4fe4857a7\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ia2xs2ft4ph61...*\n\nDisclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons Disclaimer I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice.

Let\u2019s get this discussion going!\n\n***I\u2019ll start with my conclusion first*** ***\u2013 I think Aeye is able to differentiate itself from other lidar peers due to its unique software-oriented business model. Don\u2019t be fooled by the smaller revenue size, that's because of a different business model where it licenses software at higher margins. It definitely has upside and is worth a higher valuation than what it is at right now.***\n\nQuick background on Aeye:\n\n\u00b7 An \u201ciDAR\u201d solution (LiDAR + HD Camera) company founded in 2013\n\n\u00b7 Announced they will be going public via SPAC merger with \u201cCFAC\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Software-oriented model \u2013 different from most lidar companies\n\n\u00b7 Proprietary tech: ability for its sensors to self-adapt and focus on relevant objects while in motion\n\nInvestment highlights:\n\n**1.** **TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP: AI software-oriented approach means Aeye is not \u201cjust another lidar company\u201d**\n\na. Aeye is the ONLY supplier with a LiDAR + HD Camera solution, made possible due to its software oriented approach, this can enhance the efficiency and agility of the sensor system\n\nb. Aeye\u2019s sensor is able to intelligently perceive and identify the most relevant objects and focus more on those \u2013 this is only achievable thanks to their AI software\n\nc. Specs match up well with competitors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[LIDAR Spec Comparison \\(Latest model\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cw6l8c6mztj61.png?width=1351&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edbd9deea093bca87a19822ef2766b377bc2b243)\n\n**2.** **SOFTWARE ORIENTED BUSINISS MODEL:**\n\na. Aeye\u2019s business model isn\u2019t like other lidar players, it doesn\u2019t plan on manufacturing and selling entire lidar units, which would require heavy capex\n\nb. Instead, Aeye is going for an asset light software licensing business model, which is more scalable and higher margins\n\n**3.** **SOLID STRATEGIC INVESTOR LINE-UP: Strategic investors in Aeye include automotive tier 1 suppliers, automotive OEMs, and leading tech firms**\n\na. Strategic investors from related industries include Continental, Hella, GM Ventures, Airbus Ventures, Subaru SBI, Intel Capital and SK Hynix\n\nb. Building up your own ecosystem through partnerships with key upstream and downstream players can really accelerate commercialization\n\nc. Example: Continental, one of the largest automotive suppliers with over EUR 44bn annual revenues (especially in perception related markets) has already chosen Aeye as its lidar partner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ifv8o5lztj61.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=193806f7fcb93163aed92b62407fe7e39b5f07ce\n\nfrom investor deck\n\nd. Other competitors have also formed partnerships, but Aeye\u2019s looks pretty solid to me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[lidar partnerships](https://preview.redd.it/uxl9vkkhztj61.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=434ebb31acbfe158a165300c1d698182c1938685)\n\nOk since no one is perfect... now let\u2019s look at some concerns and risks\u2026\n\n**1.** **Is Aeye too expensive / overvalued at the merger valuation of US$2bn?**\n\nIf you only look at the 2025 sales forecast for the listed Lidar companies, Aeye may seem overpriced at first glance.. however I argue that this is not necessarily so.\n\nFirst of all, Aeye forecasts their sales ramp up to happen in 2016. If you consider forward looking P/S multiple based on after the company ramps up, then Aeye may seem less pricey at 3.3x P/S (for 2026E). Tbh forecasts for new technology is always off, so whether these lidar companies ramp up in 2025 or 2026 in their forecasts really isn\u2019t important at all\n\nMost importantly, AEYE\u2019s software licensing model means its SALES NUMBER LOOKS LOWER but EBITDA margins are much higher.\n\nSo if we instead look at EV/EBITDA then Aeye\u2019s de-SPAC valuation is only 6x EV/EBITDA, compared to 10.5x for Velodyne, 7.9x for Luminar\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[valuation comparison](https://preview.redd.it/btlmq6uoztj61.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e777fe387aaae9c96df2abbe3c04d991379b717c)\n\n**2.** **Is LIDAR market a bubble?**\n\nBased on market consensus, automotive LiDAR TAM (which is 30\\~50% of the total LiDAR market), will reach US$5bn in 2025 and US$15bn in 2023.\n\nIf you add up all the listed SPAC\u2019s valuations, that\u2019s over US$20bn\u2026 so you can make the argument that as a group, lidar companies are overvalued\n\nAll these other listed lidar companies have doubled since their merger valuations\u2026 with Luminar setting the example at \\~US$10bn market cap. Aeye suffers from not being the wave of lidar companies to go public via SPAC, I think investors are getting some fatigue since it\u2019s hard to differentiate between all the different players. However, I do believe Aeye has upside potential still\n\nDISCLOSURE: I have over 1000 shares in $CFAC\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\n\n1.

        "selftext": "This is my first time posting my DD, I am mostly posting this because I really believe in this trade, but I am always looking for feedback and ways to improve my process.\n\n**5G Outlook**\n\nQCOM will be the leader in 5G technology until at least the next generation chips. 5G adoption has [been much faster than 4G](https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-5g-2022-750-million/). In 2019, 5G market revenue was $0.71B in 2020 it had increased to $2.56B with 2021 [projections](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1006994/5g-market-revenue-worldwide/) around $5.4B and $8.75B in 2022. QCOM reported $6.5B earnings in Q4 beating estimations averaging $5.93B, for a 35% YoY increase. The CEO directly stated this was due to 5G.\n\n**Competition**\n\nWith their multi year agreement with Apple and the success of the Snapdragon X60 5G in the iPhone 12, it seems like Apple will be sticking with QCOM modems for the near future. I say the near future because Apple\u2019s acquisition of Intel\u2019s modem division indicates they will begin to develop their own chipset at some point.\n\nThere is not much in the space of real threatening competition for QCOM right now. The Chinese phone manufacturer, Huawei, designs its own 5G chips and outsources production through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , but previously offered QCOM chips in its flagship models. This stopped once the trade sanctions were put in place August 2020 (which surprisingly did not result in a hit to the stock even though Huawei is the worlds biggest supplier of 5G phones).  Huawei's only 5G chip, the Kirin 980, is [blown out of the water](https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-875-vs-hisilicon-kirin-980) by QCOMs most recent 5G chip. As of now QCOM only has a [license to sell 4G chips to the Huawei, which is severly limiting their ability to supply smartphones and driving up the prices](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones). When Biden inevitably [lifts the trade restrictions he contested](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202101/1214060.shtml), Huawei will become another massive customer of QCOM and may even follow Apple's lead by abandoning their own chip design for QCOMs superior modems as the defualt modem in their flagship models. The revenue from this should be extensive due to pent up demand.\n\nSamsung has historically produced its own modems but QCOM's Snapdragon 888 seems to work [better in Samsung\u2019s phone than their own newest Exynos 2100](https://www.gsmarena.com/exynos_2100_vs_snapdragon_888_sustained_performance_and_throttling_on_the_samsung_galaxy_s21_ultra_v-news-47769.php) and you can currently buy the phone with [either chip](https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/samsung-fans-have-had-it-with-exynos-processors). There is increasing pressure for Samsung to follow suit with apple and almost all other android smartphones and transition entirely to QCOM modems.\n\nQCOM has a ridiculous [patent portfolio](https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/qroniclesofinvention/index.html) and tons of high performing low cost 5G chips available.\n\nThis is likely why it continues to dominate its much smaller competitors such as Skyworks and Broadcom. However, one of the more impressive aspects of the portfolio is the large investment in AI. Almost all modern processors take advantage of AI in some way and this will really set the stage for the future of the industry.\n\nIf technology innovation follows its historical pattern, 6G will likely not be commercially available until around 2030 and considering the exponentially increasing patent portfolio due to reinvestment in R&amp;D by QCOM, it could be a leader in this as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fundamental Analysis of QCOM and Competition \\(Purple Estimates are from Yahoo Financial Analysts\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7v1s0jbjrcj61.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9555472846e6d11e14ced4186b25b91caa0caba)\n\nQCOM is currently trading at around $137.12 after the recent volatility and I think it is a great opportunity to look at ITM Call options. It is the most affordable of its competition apart from intel which failed to keep Apple and was forced to [exit the modem industry](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/227720-how-intel-lost-10-billion-and-the-mobile-market). It also has by far the best opportunity for growth. I think the Yahoo analyst projection is actually conservative.\n\nThere is another manufacturer that some people are claiming is relevant, MediaTek. I completely disagree. While it does have 5G chips, they are abysmal compared to everything else. They have very little scalability because they are a penny stock on TPE.\n\n**Price Prediction**\n\nLooking at the price action excluding the spike from the announcement of the Apple agreement in April 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Price action analysis of QCOM ](https://preview.redd.it/rajh6u56ocj61.png?width=1687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73e89cab7db1b5d0ed86106641d41b2b4d8a3236)\n\nIt seems likely the price could range from $167.54 in the most bearish case to $258.99 in the most bullish. Giving a heavier weight to the bullish trajectory I believe $225 is a reasonable target at the current rate.\n\nThe previous Fibonacci retracement is not comparable due to the onset Covid-19 restrctions and the previous action is not very informative either because there are way too many developments in both the company and market. However, if we assume a retracement back to 0.618 at a price of $125.27 (I think the market will start to turn around due to Powell's testimony).  We should see a bounce late this week or early next week. Since this was a recovery I am expecting a trend reversal around the first Fibonacci extension metric. Which should happen close to year end, in a bullish case it keeps going on to the second metric.\n\nHowever, since the federal reserve is going to continue to its MMT policies along with the exponential rise in trading, I think 5G companies haven't yet received the attention they could (apart from AVGO), with the S&amp;P sitting at around a 39 average PE, I believe QCOMs PE has a lot of potential for upward movement in this bull market.\n\nIf we model QCOMS EPS with a 5th degree polynomial (excluding outliers) to allow for the exponential growth of 5G while hampering growth rate due to slower growth of other aspects of the company, this is the result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Red lines indicate Q1 and Q4 model EPS predictions, the equation of the best fit  polynomial is displayed. The 0.8&amp;#37; Confidence interval is shown as it visually fits the previous data well. ](https://preview.redd.it/8cntgna8ocj61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb9daa431f121e9876350d9c55e2be1be8c0d3e)\n\nThis puts the target price after 2021 at $342.45 ***at its current PE***, obviously the uncertainty is massive though and that is mostly due to the recent price action.\n\nRight now Jan 21, 2022 Calls with a $135 strike are $19.50 bid and $20.55 ask. The theta is currently -0.028 and a delta of 0.588 because it is pretty much ATM with a 36.63 IV. The IV has taken a 17% hit due to what looks like a recent correction, however this was mostly due to speculation about monetary policy, and I expect the IV to bounce as demand increases.\n\n[Date Key for Graphs](https://preview.redd.it/y3ugz6f89dj61.png?width=1554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f235f0d720e59f9fb2343771bf8d941cb918e1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[IV](https://preview.redd.it/c9dfbfzn8dj61.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa87fac5bc93a8d0edbe059951eebd291c85cffd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vega](https://preview.redd.it/55yibbwa9dj61.png?width=1126&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ecfac54784eea3fad18e26f0e2de28bf8b81e6)\n\nThe vega is at its peak at 0.508 and only slowly declines as the options go ITM while IV sharply rises, I expect a significant premium increase due to this in the rebound.\n\nThe gamma is pretty low due to the length of the option and only decreases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Gamma](https://preview.redd.it/7dns6nc0adj61.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eec82bccfcce256cc9f2f36166afbd907e0bcbe)\n\nHowever, despite this, if we saw a return to last week's price delta would increase to nearly 0.9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Delta](https://preview.redd.it/jdtgd4x9adj61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04554cc43fde2d69a648da5e6e0cbd7b85b4e6f0)\n\nThetas look relatively stable until you get 2-3 weeks from expiry and deep OTM.  If you shoot for a pre-holiday sell or roll, and you stay at least above 25% OTM, you are looking at about a 40-60% theta hit to the premium. However, following a vega path in this box, you will see a range from 0.2-0.4 average vega, with IV following correspondingly to the intrinsic value, it could see an average of about 45-65. Thus its possible to offset the theta loss with 2.6 (13%) to 11.2 (56%) \\[using $20 premium\\] which would average to about a 15.5% premium loss. I think this could even be less however because the rebound will likely be soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vega Path](https://preview.redd.it/b2dfpdackdj61.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22a6e8109e0910863f5efd91fd0a4e81ed28a27a)\n\nIt is pretty clear that the average delta will be around 0.9 assuming it goes in the right direction.\n\nAssuming the greeks follow the ranges above and selling or rolling at the target, in the most bearish case where it enters and follows the pre-Covid price action we can expect a $167 price which would net around a 229% return for the year. If we move to the next most bearish case (Yahoo Analysts) , this would net a 260% return. I think a 350-600% return is most likely though. It is not unreasonable to humor the possibility of a 1000% return on this investment in just one year.  If this stock begins to get more (deserved) attention and the PE starts to rise due to its real future value, this could be a really amazing trade 1000%+. These numbers seem too good to be true, but I invested heavily and have mostly held and or rolled both Apple and TSLA since 2017 based on similar principles, which adds to my confidence in this investment.\n\nThe figure below is a precalculated table of contract values, its pretty close to what I have, it seems like the delta curve it follows is a bit different (maybe a predetermined function and not based on the ticker's delta curve).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Third Party value calculations](https://preview.redd.it/f1tv3t1aqdj61.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d01984c67a63def0750a55e2fb33cb9975d3ceb)\n\nThis is not financial advice.

        "selftext": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much on this front. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

        "selftext": "Mandatory pledge of allegiance to GME: I was in GME before it was cool. Did both [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4cpbf/calculating_what_the_gme_price_should_be_for/) and [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktb2ms/gme_ryan_cohen_short_squeeze/).\n\nNow back to the issue at hand:\n\nA while back while reading the comments on an $NNDM DD in here, I came across a guy who said $NVMI is even better than NNDM but he's not going to write a DD on it or promote it any other way on WSB. Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I'm sharing the results with you:\n\nNova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nMetrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.\n\nMarket cap: \\~2.2 Billion\n\nP/E ratio: \\~42\n\nHas beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn't check further back)\n\nThe stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.\n\nDaily volume is low (about 150,000)\n\nIn a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it \"received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions.\"  They don't name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?\n\nAnyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.\n\nThe company's technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).\n\nI did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnicals:\n\nI don't know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it's neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy positions:Stocks80C 5/21/2021\n\nThe options market for this stock is low volume and there are large gaps between bid/ask prices, so I suggest going with the stocks.",

        "selftext": "*Oh My Goooood! It's the GUH Daily Recap! Sorry for yesterday, I was busy. Which is a good reminder that : It takes a long time to write those posts and some days, I don't have that time so... yeah, don't expect this to be a daily thing.*\n\n# Quick News\n\n- Facebook announced it was banning all accounts linked to Myanmar\u2019s military as well as ads from military-controlled companies in the wake of the army\u2019s seizure of power on Feb. 1.\n- Home builders are selling a lot of homes that don't even exist yet. A record 26.4%.\n- CEOs from more than 160 companies voiced support for President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion relief plan in a letter that was released Wednesday. The list of CEOs include David Solomon from Goldman Sachs, Sundar Pichai from Google, and Pat Gelsinger from Intel.\n- The Australian parliament passed a new law designed to force Google and Facebook to pay media companies for content used on their platforms. That could be the beginning of a new trend across the pacific?\n- The stock market dipped before Powell's speech and went up sharply the rest of the day after Powell said interest rates would stay low for a long time. Bear market cancelled! PERMABULLS UNITE!\n- Crude Oil inventories were way higher than expected. It increase by 1.28 million barrels vs an expected *decrease* of 5.19 million. \n- OPEC+ is set to meet on March 4, where it will discuss raising output as much as a half a million barrels per day starting in April, OPEC+ sources said to Reuters on Wednesday. \n- Boeing is working with regulators and customers to return the 737 MAX to the skies in Asia.\n\n\n# Quick Things I'm looking for today\n\n- Initial Jobless Claims report\n- Luis de Guindos (Vice-President of the ECB)'s speech\n\n# Quick Things I'm looking for tomorrow\n\n- Goods Trade Balance (important for inflation risks and the valuation of the dollar)\n- US Federal Budget report \n\n# Quick Earnings\n\n- NVidia's revenue at 5B vs 4.82B expected. EPS at 3.1 vs 2.8 expected. Shares at $567.04 in after-hours trading (-2.23%).\n- Apache's revenue at 1.29B vs 1.06B expected. EPS at -0.05. Shares at $21.14 AH. Stock price went up +5.37% during market open and +1.59% after-hours.\n- Booking Holdings's revenue at 1.24B vs 1.19B expected. EPS at -0.57 vs -3.85. Shares at $2,445 after market close.\n\n- Earnings I'm looking for today : Veolia, Salesforce.com, Moderna, Autodesk, AXA, Saint Gobain.\n\n\n# Quick Thoughts\n\n**Inflation is not as much of a concern as people think**\n\nLook, I've talked about inflation risks for three weeks now and this is old news at this point. Right there should be your biggest clue that those risks are priced in but I can give you more reasons.\n\nBut first, let me be clear on one point : This is a long term risk, not a short term one. The market will not crash tomorrow nor in the coming months but it can decrease the growth of the stock market. Or in the most extreme case cause a bear market or a crash.\n\nBut it seems like there are some confusion on reddit on what inflation we're talking about. So read this 10 times :\n\n*The Inflation risks are not on consumer prices but on the stock market.*\n\nRead it again! Again I said! And keep reading it because I'm sick of reading posts about that. Those risks of increase in consumer spendings are WAY overblown and frankly non-existant.\n\nThis is because the average consumer didn't receive much money from the government in the last year. And the little money he did receive, he used it to either buy stuff that he would have bought anyway or buy stuff for leisure purposes. \"*But have you seen Amazon's revenue?*\" you might say. \"*Yes, I've seen it*\" I would reply. Part of this revenue growth was due to AWS (their cloud business) and people being online more than ever during the pandemic, so server costs ballooned! \n\nBut I grant you that : there was a big increase in consumption (on e-commerce especially) BUT it was mostly due to people being stuck in their home : they didn't travel, didn't party or anything like that, so they used that excess money to buy stuff online. Also, they were pretty bored at home and buying stuff was a few clicks away so of course they'd buy useless stuffs. There were other stuffs that impacted consumer spendings like people moving outside of big cities and making their home more confortable to live in (because you know, they're stuck at home).\n\nSo, when countries reopen, this trend will probably slow down (although it's setting a shift in consumer spending from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce but that's another story).\n\nAnd with the [US exports increasing during the pandemic](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/exports), the dollar increases enough in value to offset potential inflation risks.\n\nSo yeah, this inflation was never really a concern, but now let's talk about the stock market inflation concerns that most institutions were worried about.\n\nThe concern is as follow :\n\n&gt; FED buys bonds and gives money to companies, banks and hedge funds. Hedge funds and banks put this money in the stock market. Stock market goes up artificially thanks to all that money. Companies use this to compensate for missed revenue. Their financials don't look so bad because of all the money given to them. But, nothing is organic, everything is given by the FED and this might create a giant bubble that's ready to burst.\n\nOk, so a few things about that :\n\n- The stock market being stretched is nothing new, it's been a bubble \"ready to burst\" for a decade or so.\n- The tech sector did very well without the need of quantitative easing.\n- The actual thing you should worry about is not a market crash or a bear market but rather a *reduced growth*. That's why value stocks went up or flattened these past two weeks when growth stocks plunged. Most companies will increase in value but since a much bigger growth was priced in for growth stocks, their stock prices went down. By the way, that's why Tesla's stock price went down, that had nothing to do with its 1.5bn bet. \n- And for the concerns regarding all this money given to companies, there's not that much to worry about. When the economy recovers (in my opinion slowly from end-2021 to mid-2022), companies will generate revenue organically and as the economy gets better, MoneyPrinterMan will *progressively* reduce his bond buying program and *slowly* go on phase 2 of his plan : actually combating the inflation if it becomes a concern by then. \n\nThere might be a correction at some point but hedge funds still have a shit ton of money to invest. And they're not going to keep it in cash when we have a massive bull market like that.\n\nAnd I'll finish this rant by quoting our great savior Mr. MoneyPrinterMan Powell :\n\n&gt; Fuck your puts.\n\nAlso, there's [an article that explains this very well](https://www.im.natixis.com/en-ch/markets/post-pandemic-inflation-risk-2021).\n\nOk now let's talk about Powell speech for a minute.\n\n**Powell talked. Investors were not impressed**\n\nSummary of the speech tuesday : Hey bulls, nothing new, keep buying!\n\nSeriously, that's it!\n\nHe said he will keep buying bonds at the current pace because the economy has still not recovered as much as he would like. \n\nHe said that the inflation concerns are overblown.\n\nThen senators asked about racial inequalities and Powell basically said \"wtf I'm just the chairman of the FED not the fucking president.\" (I'm paraphrasing a little) Although he aknowledged the problem, he didn't give any solution because well as he said it very well, he's \"not the fucking president\" (again paraphrasing a little ;)).\n\nThe Senator Kennedy asked \"*Do you think we ought to go Catwoman on the budget and actually look for savings there?*\" (yes he actually said that, I'm NOT paraphrasing here). Powell said he didn't know the reference (and frankly I don't fully understand what that meant either).\n\n[Link of the video and transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/ux2lCF7KhCxCaP893gBjj6a3vD6H8wjZ47XZ56eLOD_bCvbSROyURMo4XtKOMy8-K2LB3wZ87l89r0ELEMVOJYvebgU)\n\nHe also talked about unemployment rates and that... Ah! That was pretty interesting. But today's recap is already long enough. Tomorrow, you'll get my \"quick\" thoughts on that (spoiler alert : it's not quick).\n\n**C3.ai is a must buy more than ever!**\n\nThis is a short one because I've talked about this company in a previous daily recap. So I encourage you to read it first.\n\nBut now, I think this is the best time to buy the stock as it went down a lot recently (it's a growth stock and all growth stocks went down the past week or so). \n\nBut there's something that you might know : Chinese competition in the Big Data Analytics space was and is still going strong. The Chinese government is tracking everyone down which generates a lot of data, the chinese government gives chinese companies carte blanche on all fronts even if they become monopolies. And they do.\n\n[Here's a paper written in 2015 on how big the industry is in China](https://www.afcdud.com/fr/transport-afcdud/387-bigdatachina.html). \n\nBut something might change that. I really don't want to talk politics here so let's make it brief : Trump went hard on China and planned on continuing that way and people thought Biden would not go as hard. But turns out, [he follows pretty much the same strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/economy/biden-china.html). There's more detail to it, I encourage you to read the article and be informed on the situation.\n\nSo, this *might* be the moment where chinese companies get a big hit. They will probably get the same treatment as american companies and their big advantage will disappear.\n\nAnyway, so my point is this : My DD on C3.AI still stands and the potential regulation on China gives you another reason to buy (long term).\n\n**Here's a list of luxury brand companies**\n\n2 days ago, I wrote that companies selling luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now. Here's a curated list of companies that I think will benefit the most from people buying luxury goods :\n\n- Watches of Switzerland Group (it had a good run but it still has a lot of potential and it's a better bet than the others imo)\n- Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA\n- LVMH\n- Ralph Lauren Corp\n\nAlso, [a good article that talks about that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/-unstoppable-luxury-stocks-remind-some-investors-of-u-s-tech).\n\n# Quick Update on my portfolio\n\nLast week I was cash gang up until yesterday where I bought spy calls expiring in June. I fucked up my timing, I bought them 2 hours before market open because I didn't know Powell was talking yesterday. Averaged down by buying calls at open as well. I think now the inflation concerns are priced in. The worse case scenario is NOT though but there's a very small probability that inflation will actually create an economic meltdown.\n\nI expect to keep my calls for at least a month or two. But I will revise my plan if the situation changes (and I will update you anyways).\n\n--------------------------------\n*I hope you liked this one. Please feel free to ask questions in the comments and give feedbacks on this. I want to get better at this.*",

They scroll through $ETSY enjoying their coffee and while they are out they stop by Nordstrum ($JWN) and $ULTA so they can buy makeup so they look really nice for when they're riding their BF's cock.  We all know this is true, because these stocks kick ass.  They are some of the best performers of their time, because us guys simp our dicks off for women and shell out our hard earned tendies so we can hopefully have permission to jerk off during the weekly cuckoldry session.\n\nBut you know what else we simp our dicks off for?\n\nGaming, motherfucker.\n\nYeah, that's right.  The boys all game, and we all game together.  This shit is going to explode because there's nothing men spend more money on collectively outside of women and beer.  And until PornHub IPOs there isn't a better investment sitting in the market right now.  Let me paint you a picture:\n\nYou wake up Saturday morning after a long Wendy's shift the night before.  You have plenty of tendies sitting in your bank account from your last direct deposit and despite your Robinhood being -69% from your GME \"investment\" and the $600 you spent on hookers in the last week you've got enough money to buy yourself some vidya games.\n\nBut wait, you need something to play them on!  You've got some options here.  If you're a financially responsible peasant you're probably going to want to go with a Console like $MSFT Xbox or the $SNE Playstation.  You'll buy your games from $GME, $AMZN, or $BBY and you'll call it a day.\n\nBut you?  You're a rich motherfucker.  That stimmy check just hit and your peener is erect in all of its 3 inches of glory.  You're about to upgrade yourself to a gaming PC.  First off, your Gaming PC needs some parts.  Your $CRSR power supply, fans, and RAM look rather sharp.  Your $AMD processor is lightning fast and leaves $INTC chips in the dust.  And your latest generation graphics card from $NVDA can't be beat.  You'll also need some gaming gear too!  Good thing we have our old friend $CRSR and $LOGI to help us out here.\n\nBut what will you be playing?  The new Grand Theft Auto from $TTWO of course.  And maybe for the more morally bankrupt among us (sus) even $EA games.  And what powers these games?  Game engines.  Unity ($U) will be powering many of your favorite steam games.\n\nSo that's it.  You are ready to game with the boys.  But wait!  We have to throw $DKNG in as well.  Gaming with the boys wouldn't be the same without competing to see who can lose the most money over some bullshit.\n\nGaming is taking off my friends.  Keeping Gaming PC's up to date and the culture around gaming will become to men what the daily $SBUX fix is to women.  Men will begin treating PC gaming like we do cars.  We all strive to drive something nice and to take care of her.  You want to position yourself into the Chad portfolio now, because by the time the Wall Street Journal is talking about it it will already be too late.\n\nSo, do I have your vote of confidence boys?",

I feel that if I play my cards right, I could be set up for a bright future at a very young age. How should I invest this money? Should i put all of it into stocks (I don\u2019t particularly want to, that\u2019s a LOT of money). I\u2019m gonna take everything you guys say with great caution and care, you are strangers on the internet after all. I\u2019m consider buying AAPL and ARKK, as they seem safe and I feel could put money into them and then forget about them for a few years. I\u2019m also considering BB because of its potential in the self driving car industry (IVY system), NIO because of its potential to cater to the entire Chinese EV market (and possibly foreign markets), AMD because it seems they\u2019ve officially dethroned Intel as the chip making king (also gaming pcs and computers in general are going to become more and more relevant), and finally, what seems to be the riskiest of them all, TLOFF. As far as I am aware, the mining industry (cobalt specifically) has huge potential because EV batteries use cobalt. Elon himself has expressed how important cobalt is to Tesla. I\u2019m sort afraid of penny stocks because I\u2019ve heard about how volatile they can be. I would appreciate any feedback or advice. I realize I didn\u2019t include much dd in this post, but I have been doing my research. Although a lot of my dd has been pretty surface level (I don\u2019t know how to deep dive into analytics/charts, numbers yet. Still learning). Nothing is set in stone in terms of buying these stocks yet, so I can drop or add stocks. This is just my general outline of how my portfolio could possibly look. I\u2019ve also dabbled a little bit into BTC, ETH, and LINK. So far they\u2019ve been rewarding me, but it\u2019s hard to lose in a bull market, right? Thank you.",

This amount is the maximum loss amount if the underlying stock or index moves the entire spread in the money (ITM) and also the collateral that would be required by the brokerage. While % Return is the total premium collected as a percentage of the max risk amount. \n\nAll trades listed were opened anywhere between 0 and 7 DTE, with deltas in the short leg ranging between 10 and 20. The game plan is to collect premiums on spreads, with the best outcome having the short leg expire out of the money (OTM). \n\nIn the month of January alone, the portfolio experienced a maximum drawdown of 8.4% from its peak. The number would have definitely been much higher if it wasn't for these key factors:\n\n* Position sizing / trade allocation, where trades were sized properly to contain risk.\n* Trade timing / entry, where trades are entered at specific times of day for best premiums and chance of getting filled. \n* Trade diversification, where not all trades are in the same basket of stocks and carry different direction or +/- deltas.  \n\nYes, there's something about pennies and steamrollers to be said about these trades, where the % return is consistent for a few trades and suddenly a -100% return shows up to take all of the hard earned premium back. \n\nIn fact, that's exactly what happened on one of the 0 DTE SPX trades. That's where allocation, timing, and diversification helps, where we can fully expect to experience a complete loss on a small number of trades, but still come out ahead profitable overall.  \n\nFor those interested, feel free to reach out for more information or to see the full list of trades we executed in January 2021. \n\nWe\u2019re also keen on getting this community\u2019s feedback and thoughts on our trades executed; happy to share our reasoning on executing them. Let us know!\n\nOtherwise, stay safe and vigilant out there! We\u2019ll be back with another post to share our progress and findings next month!",

The company has a history of offerings and has been dark for years trying to perfect this tech, but now that they've got the bugs out they're ready for production starting Q3 of 2021. This tech is brand new and changes the economics of photonics enough that it will disrupt the industry. They've recently signed a joint venture with Sanan, a Chinese tech company with a $15B market cap. The applications of this tech will be crucial to cloud and edge computing, AI integration, and 5&amp;6G tech. Potential partners are Amazon, Cisco, Huawei, Google, and Facebook.\n\nIf you've got time, skim through their presentation: https://poet-technologies.com/docs/presentations/POET_Needham%20Tech%20Conf_01-14-21_Final_1.pdf\n\nThe risks: The tech is groundbreaking, that's a fact. POETF currently has an advantage over Intel, but not the resources Intel has. Intel would have to play catch up and there's no saying that POETF couldn't be displaced if Intel catches up, but I think this is still a safe investment until at least 2023. Keep in mind the R&amp;D phase of POETF is over, they're now focused on streamlining production and will start earning revenue in Q3 of 2021.\n\nMy prediction: I think a fair value of POETF is $4-$5, but I have a feeling once word gets out it will pump much higher to possibly $10 (since the catalysts are so good) then dump back down to a reasonable level of $4-$5\n\nI'm in 1000 shares at $1\n\nSome more reddit DD:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/PennyStocksDD/comments/l9riik/poet_technologies_poetf/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/layqli/ptkvpoetf_dd_blowing_up_ahead_of_potential/",

        "selftext": "First time:\n\nBought INTC at around March 2020 for a price of $51 per share. Idea back then was pandemic lockdown coming, everything was shifting online, 5G just started to popularize, thought that 5G &amp; gaming could have a go. Was thinking among TSM, NVDA and INTC and finally chose TSM and INTC as the Big 2 Battle  (really should have bought NVDA!). \n\nWatched INTC climb to around $60 then this sucker announced in July 2020 it had to delay its 7nm production. Shares slumped to $47-$48. 23% loss over one week. Took it three months to finally climb back to over $52 in October 2020. Sold my shares with minor profits plus tiny bits of dividend. \n\nSecond time: \n\nINTC had major reshuffling across Nov.2020 to January 2021 and the new CEO talked a good game. Thought that INTC had a bit of a \"catch-up\" play ahead. Re-entered INTC at around $58 in early January   2021. Saw the price climb to $62 on Jan.20 2021. Then some hacker hacked into the company's database and exposed part of the financial data and the company was forced to release 2020 Q4 reports early (not a great report anyway, net profit dropped 15% YoY). Took another two weeks for shares to recover to $60. Sold at $59. Again negligible profits.\n\nYes I did earn some breadcrumbs in these two trades but overall I consider it a loss since these two big ass black swans grabbed the big piece of bread from my hand. \n\nBut three times might be a charm. I am planning to enter INTC again and see if Karma is on my side this time.",

The Company believes the CSE offers a number of advantages to rapidly develop and pursue our energy transition strategy.\n\nUpon listing on the CSE, the Company intends to commence trading under a new name and symbol. \n\nOn November 23 rd , 2020, Hillcrest announced a Memorandum of Understanding with ANIGO Technologies Inc. (ANIGO) to negotiate and execute a definitive agreement whereby Hillcrest would acquire rights to certain electric machine control intellectual property (\u201cANIGO IP\u201d).\n\nHillcrest is pleased with the progress of the definitive agreement negotiations to date and expects they will be concluded shortly. When definitive agreements are completed, Ari Berger, who is the inventor of the ANIGO IP and is already acting as Hillcrest\u2019s Chief Technology Manager under a consulting agreement announced November 9, 2020, will work to develop new electric machine control IP which would be owned by Hillcrest. This new IP could then potentially be deployed to specific applications, some of which are already identified in our opportunity portfolio.\n\nCommercial applications for future new IP that might be developed and owned by Hillcrest, could potentially include a broad range of applications. Some examples of potential commercial applications include micro grid energy storage systems (ESS) for residential or business communities, electromagnetic electricity generation equipment (e.g. wind turbines, hydroelectric), electric motors and various transportation applications including electric vehicle power trains.\n\nMr. Berger is a graduate of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, with a master's degree in system control engineering, with embedded software development expertise. Mr. Berger won several awards, including one from Intel for his innovative solutions for the wafer industry.\n\nSince joining Hillcrest, Mr. Berger has been directing Hillcrest\u2019s energy technology initiatives to identify, define and assess various potential future projects and technologies. His direct involvement with Hillcrest has already resulted in exploratory discussions with technology companies and potential project partners in Germany, China, Canada and the United States.\n\nUpon joining Hillcrest Mr. Berger commented as follows:\n\n\"This is a time of technological innovation in my field,\" said Mr. Berger. \u201cAt this point in my career, it is exciting to be involved with a visionary company on a practical path to making a difference in the world while transitioning from carbon-based energy to clean energy projects. The innovative enabling technology and commercial opportunities for Hillcrest are limitless and of high value to many different industries.\"\n\nWhy do I like this stock?

        "selftext": " Hey there fellow investors,\n\nafter spending a lot of time reading this and other finance related subreddits, I'm quite overwhelmed by how helpful the people here actually are. So probs to you guys! I really hope you could give me advice, too.\n\nSo I'm fairly new to investing. I've read tons of information about how to read fundamentals, how to value stocks, what safe and not so safe investments are. I even have some knowledge about technical analysis due to my experience in forex trading.\n\nInvesting in the stock market though seems to always have some kind of false bottom opening up, the further I go with gathering information. It's also very opinion driven, there is no 100% objective analysis. That's why I'm asking you guys haha\n\nMy concern is about my general investment strategy, as I'm starting to work full time in a well paid job and want to invest a maximum amount of money to essentially be less and less dependant from this job. It's not a \"retire early\" kind of thing, I just work better knowing that my ends meet well.\n\n1. Strategy one would be constantly investing in ETFs and or Indexfunds and forget about all that for 30 years. That has proven to be the safest bet with the well known annual return of about 7%. I have to say that this is just not me. Such a long timeframe is not planable at all in my opinion.\n2. The second strategy would be spending a bit more time and picking good companies to fill a stable portfolio with promising companies. FAANG would be a good start, but of course the world is only limited to one's own mental capability of analysis.\n3. Strategy number three would be a dividend portfolio. This has the potential upside of a constantly growing cashflow. To reach a significant payout one has to invest a lot of money, though.\n4. The last strategy would be building a speculative portfolio. This requires a lot of time, research and balls.\n\nTo make this a bit more interesting for you, I've picked a few stocks corresponding to the strategies and are not overheated:\n\n\\- $INTC would be my choice to add to a quite stable, long term growing portfolio. I know, there are a lot of controversies about that company, but the bottom line is that they have a lot of upside potential and are almost \"too big to fail\". Their IoT projects are quite promising and the change of their CEO will lead them to a better place.\n\n\\- $KO Coca Cola is one of the dividend kings. I understand the businnes concept and it's a more or less safe bet, even under current pandemic circumstances. Sooner or later everything will open again and that will cause a spike in consume.\n\n\\- $GTHX would be my risky choice as I understand that it could be very undervalued. I've read quite a bit and the growth potential seems immense to me.\n\nOr would you just wait a bit and see if all the crash prophets are right and the bubble will burst, probably still in Q1 2021?\n\nI'm not looking for financial advice, just for your guide and educated opinions. :)\n\nThank you in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,   who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant   transposition of truck plans ready for production.\n\nFIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV SPAC, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV SPACs. So what  gives?\n\nAfter doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,   the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  SPAC is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n\u200b\n\n[The Allstars](https://preview.redd.it/vx58ggdybph61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d8eda0687bcc9c251e738bc5ec749e4ae602be)\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings.

Has been  involved in approximately 20 SPAC  transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one SPAC that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img iziezyszbph61...*\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***  \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**.

The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV SPACs aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l03reg5hph61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7103d77485bd0f678254717a1a8c6b8c359b8c9\n\nOnly Class 1 - no other competition\n\n\u200bThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n\u200b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wbhr6wb7hph61.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a590947664243a09652467c8148d123d8cd368af\n\nCustom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out the need for 3rd party.\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img slq253w9hph61...*\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img ag7iltkahph61...*\n\nCompanies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.\n\n\u200b\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\***\\*\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img 4tyh7gzbhph61...*\n\nPeculiar section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County, VA in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are working on?\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d  Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img i2nckdadhph61...*\n\nFormer Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV SPAC is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors! \n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s  American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say  there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut  after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like  everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img vek58v2fhph61...*\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The ELMS tree](https://preview.redd.it/bdp5omlghph61.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc1ab200d70ae923d6df9a98b4e4c72a6076cb8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice. Do your own dd. \n\nDisclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons \n\nNote: Options just came out last week. Will be accumulating March 12.5C and 15C and June 20C\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  1st and only Class 1 EV in the US with no competition. Has an  amazing  team and management. Has an EV kitted factory ready for  production by Q3  of this year in Indiana. Has 30,000 preorders already  and expects  30-60k more by next year. NOT a Chinese company, will just  be using  Sokon's already successful model and improving on it.",

        "selftext": "I've been following the stock market since around 2017. It was only small trades of a couple hundred dollars and I've learned a lot since then. Got sucked into the crypto craze, invested almost a thousand in DPW, and lost it all. After that experience, I realized I wanted to set up a decent portfolio instead of playing hype stocks. \n\nI am 25 years old, recently paid off all my credit cards last month, and just recently started creating a portfolio on TD. Currently have \\~$45k student loan debt and car loan. I have been matching my employers 401k contribution for almost 3 years now, but wanted to squeeze a little more gains out of my money since savings accounts are a joke. My end goal is to save up for a down payment on a house in the next few years. Here are my investments:\n\n**401k:**  \nS&amp;P Large Cap: 35%  \nS&amp;P Mid Cap: 20%  \nS&amp;P Small Cap: 20%  \nS&amp;P International: 25%\n\nI remember Jim Cramer years ago saying someone under 30 should be investing in equities and not bonds so this was my approach for my 401k. Will adjust my contributions to include bonds when I hit 30.\n\n**Time for the fun part, TD Account and reason for investing in these:**  \nMy approach to these holdings is mostly investing in stocks I use on the regular or stocks I just like. Looking to buy and hold 3+ years.  \nBA - a stable company that recently took a hit due to COVID and the 737 Max.  \nUBER - strong demand when economy reopens. People will need to get rides to work and go out  \nABNB - I love the platform and use it when going on vacations. I think hotels are a thing of the past, and you get more bang for your buck getting an entire house than a small room with a kitchenette (if you're lucky)  \nPETS - I myself adopted a kitten during COVID and I think a lot of people have adopted pets this past year. More demand for medications for newly adopted pets.  \nVITL - I like the chart technicals and it's been a good investment so far for me. Little higher risk, but didn't throw much at it.   \nCFFI - Fundamentals look great, lots of growth potential and I think as interest rates rise the financial sector will see growth.  \nBRK/B - P/E looks low and can't go wrong betting with Warren Buffet  \nCRM - I use this every day at work and I don't think that will change. Salesforce has a great product and I think demand for it will grow as more businesses are opting for permanent work from home.  \nINTC - Stock was down over the past 12 months as compared to other tech stocks that have soared. All my computers use Intel chips, so investing in something I use every day.  \nNXST - P/E looked low and strong revenue growth. I like the financials  \nDIS - I remember Jim Cramer saying a couple years back that Disney is always a buy, and he was right. I think as parks reopen there will be growth.  \nPDM - Decent EPS growth throughout the years, seems like a solid Real Estate sector play.\n\nPHOT and FNMA have been in my portfolio for years now, just holding the bag at this point.\n\nWhen I have a bit more saved up, was looking to add BIO and VWAGY. BIO for the healthcare play and VWAGY because I drive a Volkswagen. Also, I read somewhere no other car company has invested more into EV than Volkswagen. TSLA just seems way overbought and the P/E for VWAGY is relatively low compared to other EV plays.\n\nLet me know what you think! Thank you for taking the time reading this and appreciate any suggestions.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow retards\n\nI know these are difficult times for this sub and it\u2019s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.\n\nInstead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.\n\nThe following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn\u2019t my native language. I will try my best.\n\n**Palantir as a Company \u2013 the beginnings**\n\nPLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this \u2013 Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government\u2026.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.\n\nYou retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji\u2019s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the DD\n\nFirst of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **1. The Management**\n\nBefore I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won\u2019t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**\n\nBefore we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don\u2019t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don\u2019t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers\u2019 base isn\u2019t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That\u2019s the reason why their products aren\u2019t so tangible for many people.\n\nPLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn\u2019t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called \u201cGraham\u201d and \u201cFoundry\u201d You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:\n\nFirst example is Syria with Graham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the \u201crest of the world\u201d for you. But this wasn\u2019t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information\u2019s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.\n\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)\n\nActually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.\n\nIn their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way\n\n\u201cGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.\u201d\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)\n\nThe second example is about \u201cFoundry\u201d and it\u2019s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)\n\n\u201cAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.\u201d\n\nBoth of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the \u201cmachine\u201d with data.\n\nThe key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**\n\nPeter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)\n\nBut this didn\u2019t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like \u201elook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions\u201c. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn\u2019t get the contracts. This was also the \u201eswamp \u201etrump was talking about.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html)\n\nA fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.\n\n*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*\n\n[https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software)\n\nEven with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn\u2019t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.\n\n[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)\n\n[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)\n\nHow it\u2019s ended? Well Peter\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and \u201ebest practices \u201ein the government\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/)\n\nPLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **4. Valuation problems**\n\nI could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it\u2019s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It\u2019s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn\u2019t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.\n\nNow back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.\n\nPLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)\n\nMorgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.\n\nThese guys are very focused on numbers and I know it\u2019s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can\u2019t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.\n\nThis ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)\n\nHow is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don\u2019t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don\u2019t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don\u2019t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That\u2019s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn\u2019t happened yet. That\u2019s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.\n\nGuys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn\u2019t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.\n\nLook at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I\u2019m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash\u2026\n\nOn page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.\n\nPLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it\u2019s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don\u2019t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **5. Risks for PLTR**\n\nDespite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: \u201cWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\u201d The S1 Form didn\u2019t aged well. Actually I don\u2019t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.\n\nAs PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn\u2019t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.\n\nI think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.\n\nThere are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can\u2019t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It\u2019s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.\n\nThe risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren\u2019t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn\u2019t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)\n\nBut even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000\u00a7. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**\n\nIf you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let\u2019s connect the dots and bring this information to a point\n\n1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!\n2. Military expenditures rising worldwide\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2\n\n[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)\n\nWith Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.\n\n3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don\u2019t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don\u2019t work with it but big Institutions does.\n\nHere is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:\n\n\u201cThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public \u2014 fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars \u2014 will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.\u201d\n\n4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don\u2019t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.\n\nFacebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn\u2019t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.\n\nA remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don\u2019t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before\u2026.\n\nPLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.\n\n5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It\u2019s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I\u2019m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don\u2019t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.\n\nI have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.\n\nIf all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..\n\n**What\u2019s next?**\n\nNow we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.\n\nFor the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.\n\nThe second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don\u2019t got the GM deal? The stock tanked \u2013 for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.\n\nBut in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don\u2019t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.\n\nI would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3\u00df. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don\u2019t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid \u2013 long term.\n\nWhat does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don\u2019t do any market activity based on my DD. I\u2019m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.\n\nMy hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized \u201cthe pumpers\u201d. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don\u2019t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.\n\nI\u2019m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!\n\nLeave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!",

        "selftext": "What is the Berkshire Hathaway \ufffc mystery stock?\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s conglomerate could reveal that equity holding when it discloses its stock investments as of Dec. 31, 2020 on a securities filing expected late Tuesday.\n\nSpeculation is that it could be Walt Disney \ufffc (ticker: DIS), PayPal Holdings \ufffc (PYPL), Google parent Alphabet \ufffc (GOOGL), Home Depot \ufffc (HD), Exxon Mobil \ufffc (XOM), or Chevron \ufffc (CVX).\n\nWhen it released its most recent quarterly filing in mid-November for about $250 billion of equity holdings, Berkshire (BRK.B) said that it had made a confidential filing for unnamed investments, stating \u201cConfidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report and filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201d\n\nBerkshire CEO Buffett has rarely made use of a confidential filing in the past decade. The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 \ufffc (PSX).\n\nThe SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.\n\nThe mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nGary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.\n\nBlack has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company\u2019s lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.\n\nIn recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire\u2019s holding in Goldman Sachs Group \ufffc (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase \ufffc (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo \ufffc (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie \ufffc (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb \ufffc (BMY).\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nI think if Buffett select, it could be stable dividend payers such as xom, cvx and hd. But recent years his 2 managers will most likely pick techs, then googl and some other tech stocks will become target. Disney will be also favorable since it is the best recovery play stock with huge grow opportunity with streaming. What do you guys think.",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD post on any company, be gentle.\n\nDisclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I\u2019m not a professional, I\u2019m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy\u2019s.\n\nSources used: RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.\n\n\u200b\n\nSummary\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.\n\nRKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future\nRKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.\nThe RKT \u201cecosystem\u201d provides a \u201cfull cycle\u201d solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it\u2019s an app, it\u2019s online, it\u2019s doable from home and it\u2019s not complicated. There\u2019s an inherent advantage in what they\u2019re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that\u2019s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there\u2019s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.\nRKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.\nRKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).\nRKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they\u2019re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That\u2019s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.\nRKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That\u2019s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.\nKey Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company\n\nThe average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.\n\nThis estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. What\u2019s key here is, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.\n\nLet\u2019s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think it\u2019s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it\u2019s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.\n\nKey Point - Catalysts\n\nThis thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I\u2019m buying shares, I\u2019m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don\u2019t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.\n\nSupporting information and background follows.\n\nThe Business\n\nRKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:\n\nHome Financing\n\nRocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent \u201cpublic facing\u201d part of the Rocket ecosystem.\nAmrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as \u201csupporting infrastructure\u201d to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.\nAmrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The \u201cbusiness end\u201d in my simple understanding of the world.\nNexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.\nLendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada\nEdison Financial - Basically the \u201cfront end\u201d of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.\nHome Sale and Search\n\nRocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.\nFor Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it\u2019s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.\nAuto &amp; Personal Financing\n\nRocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.\nRocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.\nMedia\n\nCore Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.\nLower My Bills - this company is basically a \u201cportal\u201d business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.\nServices &amp; Technology Development\n\nRock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.\nRock Central - I will generalize this as \u201cbusiness support\u201d. HR, administration, etc.\nRocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.\nRecent Acquisitions\n\nRKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they\u2019re the ones leading that charge.\n\nManagement\n\nI do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune\u2019s \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d list for 17 consecutive years.\n\nFinancials and Growth\n\nWhen it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don\u2019t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here\u2019s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:\n\n$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.\n\nFrom that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.\n\nNet income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.\n\nClosed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.\n\nNet rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).\n\nRKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. That\u2019s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.\n\nRKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.\n\nQuick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They\u2019ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don\u2019t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.\n\nOk so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I\u2019m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It\u2019s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:\n\nhttps://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr\n\nI don\u2019t believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it\u2019s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.\n\nProduct Channels\n\nRKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don\u2019t lie:\n\nDirect-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)\nPartner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)\nAdjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)\nThe partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.\n\nCurrent Market and outlook\n\nRight now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)\n\nI cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.\n\nHere\u2019s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.\n\nPositions: RKT shares. Cost basis of $21.14.",

        "selftext": "By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n\n\nHere\u2019s some DD for anybody who doesn\u2019t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n\n\neBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That\u2019s just a given. \n\n\nI am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. \n\n\nLots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I\u2019m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn\u2019t why I\u2019m going fucking hard in the calls. Here\u2019s the real cherry on top:\n\neBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it\u2019s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n\n\nWell guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn\u2019t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. \n\nThis is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it\u2019s time we do the same.\n\n\nOh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok\u00e9mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It\u2019s 2021.\n\n\neBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I\u2019ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. \n\n\nTLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this?  When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers.  For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well.   The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.  \n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit.  When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of  payment for your transaction.  The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal? \n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above,  Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments.  To quote,  PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there.  PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all.  PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues.  It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

        "selftext": "1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN",

        "selftext": "Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and it\u2019s only gonna get better as it has for me. Here\u2019s a little of my own DD.\n\nThere is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:\nPoint of sales (POS) terminals\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) payments\nE-commerce solutions\n  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.\nA leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL\u2019s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that\u2019s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. \n\nAs I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square\u2019s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. \n\nThe difference between Zelle and PYPL\u2019s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn\u2019t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved\nin Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it\u2019s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isn\u2019t at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9. Don\u2019t miss this undervalued STRONG company.",

Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments. \n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer. \n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.",

        "selftext": "I just wanted to provide an update to my initial DD on Payoneer located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ldsbq1/payoneer_ftoc_updated_dd_for_valuation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Specifically, I received some very nice customer feedback from a fellow redditer. I also summarize my thoughts after visiting r/Payoneer. Finally, I offer some thoughts on valuation and why its not as straightforward as just applying a multiple to revenue .\n\n1. **User feedback.** I would very much like to thank [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/), who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer.\\* \n\n* Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles/red tape.\n* A lot of freelancers on [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/)  use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/) can't wire money to.\n* Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n* Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. *However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account.* While Payoneer likes the reputation of being \"a U.S bank account\" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. \n* As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives the users the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. \n* From [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/): \u201cOverall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both from the U.S and abroad.\u201d \n\n2. **Customer service.** After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have a few initial impressions. \n\n* While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer\u2019s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue.  \n* The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer\u2019s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.)\n\n3. **Valuation.** A number of people are comparing Payoneer\u2019s multiple to those of PayPal and Shopify. While these are the right comps, Payoneer's multiple will be determined by its customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (While technically FinTech companies are valued on revenue or earnings/EBITDA its CLTV which will determine the valuation multiple.) There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.\n\nAdditionally, many are looking at Payoneer\u2019s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added service to its customer base initially attracted by low service fees. Once agin, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation\n\nTLDR: Based on first hand feedback, Payoneer proves a very needed service. While the Wirecard scandal and fallout seem to be transitory, Payoneer\u2019s customer service needs to continue to improve. Fortunately, like cable, FinTech customers seem willing to tolerate a certain degree of frustration.  \n\nI definitely believe Payoneer has potential as a long-term buy and hold and is also a likely take-out candidate. While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or \u201cexpanding\u201d in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. \n\n**Disclosure &amp; Disclaimer**\n\nI am not a financial advisor. Please do your own due diligence.\n\nI have the following positions:\n\n1. 1,000 FTOC common shares\n2. 10 February/August Covered      Calls @ $12.50 (short)/$17.50 (long). I intend to write monthly calls      against the long option, which is known as a diagonal spread or poor man's      covered call (PMCC). If anyone has insight into the attractiveness of the      warrants, I would appreciate his/her perspective.",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** $SQ is currently trading at \\~$228. They report their earnings on 02/23 and they're going to crush it! I personally think it's pretty cheap and it'll definitely have a run up. $SQ has two Lines of Businesses: Seller and CashApp. The Seller segment includes Square's managed payment services, software solutions, hardware, and financial services offered to sellers. The Seller segment generated $409.3 million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up 12.5% compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\\*T\\*C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.\n\nHere are my bull points:\n\n**Seller Segment:**\n\n* Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of\n   * Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.\n   * Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.\n* More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -&gt; more people shopping outside -&gt; more small businesses profiting -&gt; more $\n* Most states (including businesses) are open ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)).\n* 2nd round of PPP: Credit lenders approved $5 billion loans in 1 week starting 2nd week of January 2021([https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/)). Small businesses aren't going anywhere and are here to stay.\n\n**CashApp Segment:**\n\n[$SQ vs. $PYPL vs. B\\*T\\*C Relative Pricing Chart](https://preview.redd.it/dktqnolq5df61.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973334c125737ffdef02ed247bdadc27eb5fe56f)\n\n1. There was a very strong correlation between B\\*T\\*C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\\*T\\*C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant. **Not priced in!**\n2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ([https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ)). **Not priced in!**\n3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp. **Not priced in!**\n4. B\\*T\\*C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%. **Not priced in!**\n\n **Other Bullish Points:**\n\n* 1% of $SQ's asset is in B\\*T\\*C. B\\*T\\*C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\\*T\\*C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter. **Probably priced in.**\n* CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:\n\n[App store](https://preview.redd.it/zcuqy9iuddf61.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=983ac6fd8bf65f114c7a2f38849708f7186aef07)\n\n**Bearish Points:**\n\n* The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling\n* $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* EMT\n* B\\*T\\*C doesn't crash before earnings\n\nTake advantage of the low pricing right now to get in and using ER as hedge if you're planning to sell before expiry.",

        "selftext": "Payoneer has been silently \u201cdefeating\u201d PayPal in the B2B arena (which is potentially a larger market with higher growth opportunity than B2C):\n\n1) EBay in Greater China is exclusively partnering Payoneer (this is doubly ironical because PayPal used to be part of eBay)\n\n2) Amazon affiliates does not allow PayPal payouts, but accepts Payoneer. (Amazon is the largest online marketplace, top affiliates earn millions in revenue.)\n\n3) Just google or search YouTube \u201cPayoneer vs PayPal\u201d. Majority of the articles say that Payoneer is better (mostly in the B2B/gig economy context).\n\n4) Payoneer may have some customer service issues, but the problem is that PayPal is worse. (Trustpilot rating of 4.4 vs 1.2 for Payoneer vs PayPal.)\n\n5) Payoneer has better coverage in emerging markets and developing countries. For example, PayPal totally does not operate in Pakistan, but Payoneer does. Growth in US, Europe is stagnating while emerging markets have potential for triple digit growth.(Payoneer did in fact experience up to 900% growth in Philippines, Vietnam, etc.)\n\nWhat Payoneer lacks now is media coverage, and brand awareness. The average person doesn\u2019t hear about Payoneer because it is B2B, only businesses and sellers use it behind the scenes.\n\nMildly Optimistic case: \n\n- Betsy Cohen (or someone else like Cathie Wood) ups the game and promotes Payoneer for the great company it really is. (Currently the PR promotion and media coverage is really non-existent, to be honest Betsy Cohen is not good at this compared to Chamath.)\n\n\n- Payoneer captures 5% of PayPal\u2019s equivalent market share and hence market cap. PayPal has $300B market cap so that would make Payoneer a $15B company (which is roughly 2-3X its current market cap).\nThat would equate to a solid stock price of $20-$40.\n\nModerate Bull case:\n- Payoneer expands to B2C and directly competes with PayPal head on, capturing 10% of PayPal\u2019s market share. That would make Payoneer a $30B company at around 5X its current market cap, ie $60-$70 stock price.\n\nNote that the above cases does not even require Payoneer beating PayPal, it just requires Payoneer to be worth 5%-10% of PayPal.\n\nBear case (quite unlikely imo):\n\n-Payoneer does not get the media coverage it deserves. No one, even institutions, knows about Payoneer hence low volume in stock trading.\n\n- PayPal totally dominates &gt;95% of the market, does not allow Payoneer to grow to 5-10% of PayPal\u2019s size\n\nPayoneer remains at 2% of PayPal\u2019s size. (This is definitely already achieved based on Payoneer\u2019s revenue of $0.5B vs PayPal\u2019s $18B.) Then, Payoneer is a $6B company which corresponds to $13-14 stock price.\n\n\nReference article (old but still relevant): https://www.paymentsjournal.com/executive-spotlight-series-with-scott-galit-from-payoneer/\n\nHighlights:\n\nHow does Payoneer stand out from other fintech companies?\n\nPayoneer is really a pretty unique FinTech company.\n\n\u2022B2B Focus \u2013 we focus exclusively on business payments. While B2B payments has much larger volume than consumer payments, it has attracted just a fraction of the attention and the investment of B2C\n\n\u2022Global \u2013 we\u2019re a truly global provider and company. We support customers that come from over 200 countries and enable them to transact through us in more than 150 currencies, and settle through more than 170 local clearing systems. We are regulated in the US, Europe and Asia, have offices from Silicon Valley to Tokyo, supporting our customers in more than 70 languages.

        "selftext": "Im here to tell you to add $TSNP to your watchlist, do your own DD and take on a position soon if you like what you see. I have searched countless days/hours on this stock and can\u2019t believe my eyes. This company use to be a flooring company and was bought out by HUMBL PAY, a new mobile app similar to PayPal and square, app is launching any day this month.\nThe difference of this app and PayPal/square is this company will be worldwide and target the countries PayPal doesn\u2019t operate in. It\u2019s not just a digital payment method, it\u2019s a digital currency exchange from country to country. If you have family in Mexico, you can send USD and it be converted directly into pesos. They will launch in 40+ countries this month alone.\n\nAnother big part of their business model is Hmbl Financial, this portion of the app is directed towards blockchain and crypto capabilities. The CEO Brian Foote has mastered the blockchain industry and plans to utilize it like no other. He\u2019s a very motivated CEO eager to change the world and very open about it. One of the things I admire about him and the company is PR, they hold investor calls once every other month and have been smashing their timelines. Working 20 hours a day his app is launching 4 months ahead of schedule.\n\nThe third portion of the app, yes another addition...\nIs Humbl Marketplace. A very similar concept of Shopify and Etsy. They will have endless merchants on their market place and you can be one too, they make it so you can launch a business on their platform within a day, and with the crypto and currency exchange within its own app, it\u2019ll be easier than every to buy/sell globally.\n\nRemember, TSNP has ZERO of anything to do with HUMBL beside the fact that humbl bought them out, humbl wanted to shortcut its way to the market and get a ticker already listed. This is 1,000% a different company so don\u2019t judge the balance sheet off of that.\nThe ticker will be changed to $HMBL any day this month and that alone will wake people up that this company is transforming. Humbl hits 3 markets within one app and one day will be globally. The three markets have been proven to be successful and all within one app sounds astounding. Market place/digital currency, crypto buying and selling/world currency exchange. All with lower fees that any competitors.\n\nI rest my case, GLTA.\nBe HMBL.",

Everything you read is highly questionable and accuracy of information is not guaranteed. No financial advice here. I have a significant long position in PSTH. The merger target and date could be incorrect. I\u2019m talking up my book. This is not a research report, just speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis: There is two parts to this speculation**\n\nA. PSTH will merge with Stripe. (For these see A-Exhibits)\n\nB. The announcement will come on Feb 17th. (For these see B-Exhibits)\n\n**What is Stripe?** A payment processing company that competes with Square and PayPal. In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company ra ised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $36 billion. It is currently being valued at $70 billion or more. Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. I\u2019m very familiar with the Irish, and the duo are extremely smart and have European way of thinking and mannerisms. \n\n**Background:** I presented the speculative evidence for Stripe being the target in A-Exhibits and timing in B-exhibits. A lot of these are scraped from various people who have done lots of digging. A speculative trade like this has high risk but also high reward. Nailing the timing on this would be tickets to retirement for some. So SPACs move massively on any news of discussion with a good target. Stripe is in my opinion as sweet honey. I highly doubt that Ackman and all those big investors like Guggenheim would invest in a SPAC without having a solid short list. I think their short list had Bloomberg and Stripe on it. They flirted with AirBnB and Coinbase just to see their chances. If any of those happened or a new sweet target emerged then they would do a quick second SPAC. They used PSTH to grab attention of other companies and see what they can attract for their future SPACs. Kind of like what Chamat did. I speculate that Stripe was their target and Stripe was just spending time getting ready for the Feb 17th announcement. All this is speculation. I also have read speculations about StarLink and Plaid and those really didn\u2019t hold any water. Collison brothers\u2019 way of running their companies has been very European like. Very cooperative and trusting of the process. They didn\u2019t mind giving a big chunk of their company to Y-combinator. They didn\u2019t mind hiring agitators. They just seem to operate like they live in Ireland and everyone is trustable. They are not used to dealing with NYC sharks. They are easy prey for a top predator like AckFuckingMan.  \n\n**Exhibit A-1: Stripe has been going on a hiring spree. 973 job postings vs last year 260** \n\n[https://stripe.com/jobs/search](https://stripe.com/jobs/search)\n\nBelow is how their site looks now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u404o2ce0ah61.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f2b63deb8432098c9ffd7c6f8d5a631276354f\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is how their postings looked in April of 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwqdv8mf0ah61.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622ccdaf94f6b5781f2e2e78be103256bf005c79\n\nHiring needs money! They are obviously seeing a huge injection of money coming their way. \n\n**Exhibit A-2: Privacy statement of Stripe updated** \n\nNew text added regarding \u201cother entity which buys us\u201d to their privacy statement. \n\nBelow is the privacy statement once updated:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ehnhm8jg0ah61.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3244068df641543e55fece6bd0306acc1e16c8ff\n\nBelow is how it looked in early 2020: (see it is missing that sentence)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kunyeoch0ah61.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be19b5bf85f9e8b3614ab59f3dbddff23863084\n\n**Exhibit A-3: Bill Ackman follows 190 people on twitter and oddly 3 are stripe et al**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9x0tz0gi0ah61.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2678e3b0aeaedc4ee60b22533fcd3067ad2067c9\n\n**Exhibit A-4: Ackman mentioned that he talked to stripe** \n\n[https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917](https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917)   Minute 15:17\n\nStripe wasn\u2019t ready to go public but they sure seem to be working towards it. Bill mentions \u201cManagement\u201d, \u201cInfrastructure\u201d, and \u201csystems\u201d. So that ties into exhibit A-1.

Jackie was the head of capital for square and stepped down. She has also been liking tweets from Ackman. \n\n**Exhibit A-10: Peter Collison interacted with posts about SPAC on Twitter.** \n\nThose were on Jan 8th. They have been deleted since. I could be wrong about this exhibit.\n\n=====================================================================\n\n**Exhibit B-1: Bill Ackman earnings call: Ackman gave a 2021 Q1 target**\n\n[https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA\\~\\~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad](https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA~~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad)\n\nMin 42:30\n\n*\u201cIn terms of timing, what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us, we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter. Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won\u2019t meet our expected timeframe\u201d-* \n\n**Exhibit B-2: The two meetings are right one after another. Seems to be coordinated.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img dqict6sq0ah61...*\n\n**Exhibit B-3: Note the bump in price and volume earlier this week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kc91bnr0ah61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bf1186fb68589b1a38dbccbb91f46d7a0b537dd\n\nThis points to some insiders getting ready for the announcement. \n\n**Exhibit B-4: IV on the call options suggest big imminent news**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/160of5js0ah61.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94de0ac8eac7bbd6b0f281321ee5fb4f432ad818\n\nThis was captured before news of 13G filed on Friday. \n\n**Exhibit B-5: Twitter activity**\n\nOn Feb 8th Bill tweeted a Rap Song about SPACs: [https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096)\n\nBill is not too active on twitter, nor is John Collison.\n\nPatrick and John Collison both had a notable reduction in twitter activity in first week of Feb and all of a sudden they came alive on Feb 8th. This is the day that PSTH shares jumped \\~6% on no news. Insiders buying? There was a lot of unexplained excitement on that day both in twitter behaviour of parties involved and price of PSTH. \n\n**Exhibit B-6: 13G filing by PSH**\n\nNews of raising more money coming out just now! See 13G filled on **2/12/21** after hours. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm) \n\nI think there is a lot of confusion about this. People are saying that it is PSH increasing the PIPE, and this is pointing to a bigger deal. I think this is false. I think for that you need an S-3 filing. This is obviously above my paygrade and we need a securities lawyer to decipher this for us. What is noteworthy is that this simple news made **the stock move 10% and warrants move 25%.** So you see any small hints of positive news make this baby move massively.  \n\n**=================================================================================**\n\n**Notable Institutional Investors:**\n\nPERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.  200,000,100 $5,544,002,772\n\nGUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC    22,000,000 $499,180,000\n\nBAUPOST GROUP LLC     12,707,924 $352,264,000\n\nCITADEL ADVISORS LLC     2,167,041 $49,170,000\n\nPEAK6 INVESTMENTS LLC **(CALL)**    577,400 $16,006,000 **(New Position)**\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC    299,498 $8,302,000 **(New Position)**\n\nIt is speculated by redditors that the prominent wealthy investor that Bill Ackman was talking about is either Warren B, Bill G, or the Warlton family. I think this doesn\u2019t matter since there is enough institutional and big money interest in this that money is not an issue. A celebrity name like Bill Gates or Warren B would be nice.",

        "selftext": "eBay is going to roll on their earnings.\n\nBy roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n\n\nHere\u2019s some DD for anybody who doesn\u2019t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n\n\neBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That\u2019s just a given. \n\n\nI am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. \n\n\nLots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I\u2019m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn\u2019t why I\u2019m going fucking hard in the calls. Here\u2019s the real cherry on top:\n\neBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it\u2019s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n\n\nWell guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn\u2019t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. \n\nThis is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it\u2019s time we do the same.\n\n\nOh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok\u00e9mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It\u2019s 2021.\n\n\neBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a dumb and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I\u2019ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. \n\n\nTLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL",

        "selftext": "Tl;dr Prosus trades for roughly half of its AUM\n\nProsus is the international investment arm of South African conglomerate Naspers. Having grown to the point it dominated the entire Johannesburg Exchange, Naspers spun off Prosus, basing in in Amsterdam.\n\nProsus makes it business investing in start up internet and technology companies. It holds stakes in India food delivery service Swiggy, International food delivery Deliver Hero, and Latin America food delivery iFood. It also hold 40% of US reseller OfferUp, and 28% of Russian internet conglomerate Mail ru. They also own 98% of PayU, a fintech payment system similar to PayPal, used across Eastern Europe, South America, and Africa. \n\nSounds decent, yes? The kicker, and the single most important investment is a 31% minority ownership of Chinese megacorp Tencent. In addition to owning nearly a third of the video game/social media/entertainment goliath, it also claims a board seat. Tencent has recently become involved in investing in startups of its own, and Prosus has direct access to sit in on those meetings, and get in on every potential deal on its own.\n\nAs of today, Tencent is worth just over $900B. At 31% ownership, this should give Prosus a valuation of $279B, off this one investment alone. And yet the company trades at a valuation under $200B. Prosus has specifically stated it has no intention of selling off its stake in Tencent, but it could do so and immediately have more cash on hand than its entire valuation. None of this even accounts for every other investment they have.\n\nManagement is acutely aware of the discrepancy between its valuation and actual AUM, and is working to get better correlation. It has approved a $5B stock buyback program, and is committed to taking further steps as necessary yo reach a proper valuation.\n\nIn short, Prosus is steeply discounted when you add up all of its total assets, and represents a fantastic buy opportunity. I've been in them since about fall of last year, and have been happy with CEO Bob Van Dijk's candid language and dedication to shareholders. Good luck to any potential investors.\n\nPosition: 1200 shares at $22.23",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m in the UK and have about $40,000 (\u00a330k) to invest. If I was in the US I would put it all in ARK ETFs, because I really admire the investment strategy and obviously the ARK ETFs have done incredibly well recently. However, you can\u2019t invest in any ARK funds from the UK. My intention at the moment then is to build a portfolio based on the ARK ETF holdings, primarily from the genomics and next gen internet funds but not exclusively. My thinking behind this is that my own independent research is never going to match up to that of these guys (and other large institutions); I was thinking then of looking through the ark holdings for the different funds and spreading my investments across a number of their holdings, such as Exact Sciences, Shopify, PayPal,Teledoc etc etc. To me this seems like a pretty sound strategy but I have a couple of concerns:\n\n1. A lot of these ark holdings have had some really good runs recently, and so there\u2019s obviously the concern of buying at the top.\n2. Sufficient diversification\n\nIf anyone got any thoughts on this idea I\u2019d really like to hear them. Cheers.",

        "selftext": "Feb.15 is Presidents\u2019 Day and market is closed. With the second quarter of 2021 coming and policies of the new administration becoming clearer, I am looking to allocate my extra cash into a few sectors that I believe will have potentials but are either absent or underrepresented in my portfolio. I don\u2019t talk about popular sectors such as Fintech, online retail, renewable energy, IT and cloud computing, medical and healthcare, online streaming, electric cars e.t.c. simply because I already have picked my stocks and/or ETFs from these places.\n\n======\n\n1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, BNY, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN\n\nI welcome your thoughts and hope you all have a bullish and profitable 2021.",

        "selftext": "Contrast this with the recent news of PayPal shutting down its domestic operations in India.\n\nThis is an external source from Deutsch Bank, it is not Payoneer blowing its own horn. https://cib.db.com/insights-and-initiatives/flow/cash-management/prescient-on-payments.htm\n\nA key point that Payoneer is focusing on is \u201cworking capital\u201d. Essentially, it is money-lending to companies. Payoneer is focusing very hard on this. In fact, they have the Israel's former chief economist of the Ministry of Finance Yoel Naveh leading Payoneer\u2019s working capital division. Money-lending, as everyone knows, is very lucrative. \n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for people in India (or anyone in  the world) to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. \n($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)\nGiven all the recent news and growth, it is hard to imagine Payoneer cannot achieve that?\n\n\nSource (Deutsch Bank): https://cib.db.com/insights-and-initiatives/flow/cash-management/prescient-on-payments.htm\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country. Reports such as a 2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce and, according to Payoneer\u2019s 2020 Freelancer Income Report, work for an average hourly rate of INR1,282 \u2013 just over US$17, against a global average of US$21.\n\nIn August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India. It added that it was in talks with banks and non-bank financial companies to add working capital products to its payment services, although negotiations to gain the necessary regulatory authorisation have since been delayed by Covid-19.\n\nIndia is an FX-thirsty country which imports more than it exports,\u201d says Kulkarni. Indeed, OECD data for 2018 showed total exports at US$326bn and imports at US$492bn, an imbalance of US$166bn. \u201cIf you\u2019re an exporter and want to be compliant, you need to complete the documentation, but until recently it took months to complete a transaction. The banks also charged hefty fees that reflected the large amount of physical work involved and the rather chaotic process.\n\u201cDigitisation makes the job much easier \u2013 the documents can be downloaded, sent to the bank and the whole process completed within seconds, which helps merchants considerably.\u201d The achievement was recognised when Payoneer won in the Best Payments and Collections Solution category in The Asset\u2019s Treasury, Trade, SSC and Risk Management Awards 2020.\n\nDisclosure: Long FTOC common shares\n\nDisclaimer: Not a financial advisor",

        "selftext": "Hi, investor newbie here (6 mo.). I want to trim the amount of individual stocks that I own as I believe I overdiversified my money. I own some shares in both companies and they are the least performing in my portfolio. I would like to sell one as I could use the money on a better performing stock that I have gains in (QCLN/AMD/APPL).  For what it's worth, I have a little more money invested in Verizon, than I do Coca Cola. Can someone help me figure out what's the better stock to keep between KO and VZ? After doing some DD, this is what I came up with:\n\n\\_**The case for selling KO:\\_**\n\nCoca Cola: I got into this last stock July for $48.80 and it's currently at $49.92, so there's been zero growth. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q3-2020), they haven't been doing well either. Their revenue is down 10% from a year ago and their gross profit has decreased as well. KO's balance sheet shows that their total assets have went up, but so has their debt. They have increased their total debt by 15%, which has decreased the total equity value of the company. \n\nKO has also tripled the amount of money purchased in investments (according to their cash flow sheet), leading me to believe that they have no plans to recover immediately and are playing the long term game. \n\n**My** **Conclusion:** The only case for keeping KO currently is because of their dividends and name recognition. The pandemic has really affected KO and will probably not recover until it's over. With that being said, other stocks are booming so it would be foolish to leave money here to trade sideways until the COVID is over.\n\n\\_**The case for selling VZ:\\_**\n\nThis stock has actually been in a steep decline for several months, since hitting their ATH in early December. I'm currently in the negative in this stock, which is insane giving that the stock market set a new ATH records across the 3 major indexes. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q4-2020), their net income is down 9.6% (their revenue only increase 1% for the year). \n\nLike KO, VZ has also increased their amount of debt, but only by 8%. Their total equity is good, as it has increased by 10% from the year prior. Their cash flow sheet shows that they've spent a lot of money in investment activities, but this is offset by the net cash they gain in the last year (10+%). \n\n**My Conclusion:**  The case for if I should keep VZ is a conundrum for me. Their financials show growth, but the value of their stock declining sharply during a record level boom market. They have a at great dividend (4.5%) but it is not enough to cover their stocks loss in value. It is concerning and selling this stock would incur a slight loss for me. However I could regain it back quickly if I took the money wasted here and invest it into another stock (PayPal for example). \n\n**TLDR:** I own both KO and VZ. I would like to sell one of the stocks to chase gains in growth stocks, while keeping the other long term. Which one should I keep?",

        "selftext": "Hi Guys, \n\nI wanted to introduce you guys to Innovation Payment Solution ($IPSI). This is a fintech company based out of Southern California. Their primary product is a mobile payment system (IPSI Pay) used for money transfers. For instance on 2019 alone, IPSI kiosks processed 4.5 million transactions in Mexico. The company is now focusing on the United States. 50 kiosks are planned to be operating by Q2 2021 in Southern California. The company is also expanded on other fronts. They are about to roll out their very own \u201cIPSI coin\u201d - backed by the US dollar. But bigger news than that, is that they have moved into B2B and B2C ACH by starting the \u201cIPSI Payroll\u201d and \u201cIPSI Wallet\u201d platforms!\n\nIPSI is fully reporting to OTCQB. They have a share structure about one tenth the size of TSNP/HUMBL. There was a recent surge in price given the recent news.\n\nThe mobile payment sector is hot! PayPal, Paysafe, Payoneer, TSNP/HUMBL, FORW, etc. Obviously interest in IPSI is bruising now.

        "selftext": "I updated the post below to reflect the current valuation and provide a context for evaluating FinTech companies. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor [presentation](https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/investor-presentation.pdf?_ga=2.142077554.1186770460.1612586492-2042252415.1612359068) and [webcast](https://viavid.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1426630&amp;tp_key=f7e0f9ea11). I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Payoneer (FTOC)**\n\n**Summary:** Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position.\n\nIMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available.\n\n**Company:** Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world).\n\n**Customers:** Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n**Industry and market opportunity:** B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300mn. Obviously, the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\n**Management team:** Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at Mastercard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see.\n\n**Business model:** Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and is expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed.\n\nWhile the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn\u2019t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I\u2019m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related.\n\nAs for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), its clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC's DD. My guess is they drilled down and liked what they saw.\n\nNote: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning.\n\n**Valuation:** FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.\n\nBased on FTOC's current share price of $13.50, Payoneer is currently trading at roughly $6bn, which assumes \\~430mn total shares outstanding.\\* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels.\n\n* The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's shares and the 30m share earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading 30% above NAV.\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\n**1.** **Majority of traffic stays within the network.** In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer.\n\n**2.** **Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends.** As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated.\n\n3. **Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate.** The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n4. **Playing the long game.** The company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Expect M&amp;A to figure into the company\u2019s strategic plans as well.\n\n**5.** **Attractive valuation:** Payoneer\u2019s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and \"adjusted\" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or \"expand\" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more \"a when rather than if\" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n1. **Competition:** PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don\u2019t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here.\n2. **Customer risk:** Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo).\n3. **Regulatory:** Payoneer needs to navigate every country\u2019s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V.\n4. **Crypto currency:** At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if its just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer.\n5. **FX exposure:** I\u2019m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure.\n\n**TLDR:** Payoneer is a proven company in a great space with a solid management team that is playing the long-game. IMHO, it could be a very attractive investment for LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am not a financial advisor.\n\nPositions:\n\n1. 1,000 FTOC common shares\n2. 10 February/December Covered Calls @ 12.50 (short) /17.50 (long). I intend to write monthly calls against the long option, which is known as a diagonal spread or poor man's covered call (PMCC). If anyone has insight into the warrants, I would appreciate his/her perspective.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone!\n\n**Small Cap Watchlist (under $10)**\n\n1. TYME: Gapping up on a COVID catalyst. Currently showing strength in premarket with high relative volume, I'll be keeping an eye on this one, but be patient and don't force trades. Resistance around 4.00 on the daily chart.\n2. CPSH: Gapping up on a seemingly pretty weak catalyst. Low float, so could see some volatile swings this morning. Be careful, and make sure to have an exit strategy if you choose to enter a trade. Premarket resistance around 9.80, with support at 8.85-8.90.\n3. AREC: Gapping up continuing momentum from yesterday's trading, no new catalyst. Low float so could see some volatile swings. Sometimes these day-2 plays die down early in the morning without providing trading opportunities, but it's worth keeping an eye on for a continuation play if price action and volume permit it. Premarket resistance at 4.63.\n4. ZYNE: Gapping up without a known catalyst. Seeing decent volume and price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance at around 4.40, with a potential gap to fill to a daily chart resistance of around 4.80. \n5. SNDL: Gapping up on momentum from previous days of trading, no new catalyst. Showing some strength in the premarket, with good price action. Extremely high float, so this could be a slow mover, but I'll be keeping an eye on it. \n6. SELB: Gapping up without a known catalyst. Good price action on okay volume in premarket. Showing some weakness now after if failed over premarket resistance, but I like it if it can get back up and cross that resistance at 5.74.\n7. CRBP: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday's trading. Seeing good price action and volume in the premarket. Premarket resistance around 3.14, with possible support around 2.50.\n8. CANF: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday's trading. Seeing good volume and decent price action in the premarket, with resistance around 2.55 and support at 2.10.\n\n**Large Cap Watchlist (over $10)**\n\n* Gapping UP: SLS, VCVC, ENLV, FUTU, CLNE, ZGNX, MJ, TLRY, APHA, GRWG, PYPL, CRSP, BEAM, MGNI, DKNG, PLTR, LAC, MARA, RIOT, GME\n* Gapping DOWN: SPOT, VXRT, X, HYLN, GSK, INO, CCIV, SQQQ, UVXY\n\nLots of stocks gapping up today, and good day for small caps in particular--lots of gap ups. We could see a push back to all-time-highs for SPY, but I expect to see some resistance. Silver up again today, and I'll be watching GME with popcorn once again. We've been seeing some little spikes in volatility, so things could potentially get choppy again. If it does happen to get choppy, use proper risk management and there is nothing wrong with sitting a day out. But until you see signs of choppiness, I'm expecting a relatively smooth start to the day. Selling cash secured puts is one of the strategies that I utilize, but I am currently being cautious regarding selling puts after we saw that recent correction.\n\nAlways remember proper risk management, and be a picky trader. Only you decide when you want to enter a trade, so don't force anything.

        "selftext": "  \n\nHi all,\n\nYesterday Enphase Energy published their Q4 2020 results. See my earlier DD here in this sub. \n\nWith this post I would like to discuss the results and the web-call with regard to future growth/earnings. So far my investment in Enphase was a solid move (5% after-market), let\u2019s hope that this momentum will increase. I have divided this post in three chapters: results, web-cast management notes and analyst Q&amp;A. However, before we continue let me first do a short into on the new C-suite hire. \n\n**Chief Marketing Officer**\n\nEnphase recently announced that they hired Allison Johnson as Chief Marketing Officer. Who is Mrs. Johnson and why did they hire her at this moment? Are sales declining or are there some amazing plans in the pipeline? \n\n\u201cJohnson brings decades of executive marketing experience to Enphase, including serving as chief marketing officer at PayPal, where she led a global marketing transformation, and as vice president of marketing communications at Apple, Inc., where she helped launch some of Apple\u2019s most iconic products and campaigns of the Steve Jobs era. Johnson received her Bachelor of Science degree in journalism and communications at the University of Florida.\u201d\n\nWhen checking her Linkedin, she started working at IBM as a Media Relations Director, moved to Netscape (1 year) \u00e0 HP (6 years) \u00e0 Apple (6 years) \u00e0 West (7 years) \u00e0 Paypal (1.5 years). \n\nLet leave it here for now. \n\n**Results Q4 2020:** \n\n\u00b7 We reported revenue of $264.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, along with 40.2% for non-GAAP gross margin. We shipped approximately 762 megawatts DC, or 2,292,132 microinverters.\n\n\u00b7 Revenue of $264.8 million \n\n\u00b7 Cash flow from operations of $84.2 million; ending cash balance of $679.4 million \n\n\u00b7 GAAP gross margin of 46.0%; non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2% \n\n\u00b7 GAAP operating income of $79.1 million; non-GAAP operating income of $72.4 million \n\n\u00b7 GAAP net income of $73.0 million; non-GAAP net income of $71.3 million\n\n\u00b7 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.51\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 8rqzlro7vmg61...*\n\nThis was their forecast for Q4 2020:\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, Enphase Energy estimates both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results as follows:\n\n\u00b7 Revenue to be within a range of $245.0 million to $260.0 million; revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments\n\n\u00b7 GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37.0% to 40.0%, excluding the recovery of the remaining $16.0 million tariff refund that has not yet been approved; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38.0% to 41.0%, excluding tariff refund and stock-based compensation expenses\n\n\u00b7 GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $51.0 million to $54.0 million, including $16.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization\n\n\u00b7 Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $35.0 million to $38.0 million, excluding $16.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization\n\nSo one can say that they performed extremely well. \n\n**Management notes web-call:**\n\n**Badri:** \n\n**\u201c**Let's now talk about manufacturing. Our operations team did a great job flexing manufacturing as 2020 played out. When the pandemic began, we cut manufacturing in Q2 of 2020 and then had to quickly ramp back up to meet the surge in demand in Q3 and Q4. The production in Q4 was more than two times the level in Q2. I'm very pleased with the ramp of our Mexico factory that met our target of producing more than 1 million units in Q4.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs part of our supply chain strategy to diversify production to tariff free and cost competitive locations globally, we began microinverter production at Salcomp, India in October of 2020 and started shipping to customers during Q4. We have a high quality state-of-the-art automated line with a quarterly production capacity of 0.5 million units and the space to add a second line with the same capacity. The production ramp is going very well and we expect to produce approximately 400,000 microinverters in India in Q1.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's now move on to the regions. Our US and international revenue mix for Q4 was 82% and 18%.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Europe, we reported record revenue for Q4. Revenue increased 10% sequentially. On an annual basis, the revenue from Europe increased 32% in 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Australia, we built on our strong Q3 results and achieved record quarterly sell-through and record installer count in Q4. The results were fueled by the launch of our Enphase Installer Network or EIN as well as growing demand for our high power IQ 7A microinverters plus a favorable competitive environment as regulations continued to shift towards safer and smarter solar. We expect to introduce our Enphase Storage system for the Australian market during the fourth quarter of 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Latin America, we reported record quarterly revenue. Puerto Rico showed strength for our microinverter systems as well as our storage systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the uptick in broad economic activity has stressed the global semiconductor supply chain. We are seeing constraints on a few semiconductor components used in our microinverters.\u201d \n\n**\u201c**There are two specific components that we are constrained on. One is our ASIC that goes into the micro and the other is the AC FET drivers that actually drive the high voltage FET. There the name of the game is we are qualifying multiple more sources so that we have more supply as well as expediting product. And I am in direct touch with the CEOs of those companies and they are helping as much as they can. We expect to get all caught up basically by early April. Our top priority through all of this is to ensure that we take care of customers. So we will do whatever it takes in order to ensure their lines are running and that they are not affected. So that's on the microinverter side.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou will see a lot more going forward. So we continue to grow at a nice clip. You can do the math. If we continue to grow at this 30%, soon we will need a third supplier, that might happen in 2022 and we are already talking to those people\u201d\n\n**TL:DR: They are growing in every aspect. They are trying to train installers internationally (Australia, Europe, South-America). Ones these installers are trained appropriately, they will start installing the products. Enphase will rather wait with the installment to only send very trained personnel, then just let a shitty installer do the job.** \n\n**Q&amp;A:**\n\n**Q1: \u201c**Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. So you said you'll start shipping IQ 8 in 2Q. How should we think about IQ 8's standalone pricing versus IQ 7? What may be the range on the premium and might you expect over time a majority of installers shifting more toward IQ 8 versus IQ 7 or is the jury out on that question still?\u201d\n\nA1: \u201cWith regarding whether people are going to adopt IQ 8 over IQ 7, we think the answer is a no brainer. It's going to be, yes. IQ 8 is a grid-independent microinverter system. So, therefore, I expect the adoption to be high when it is released and there are obviously a lot of combinations with IQ 8 and in some cases, people might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smarter storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.\u201d\n\nQ2: \u201cOkay. Thank you. And just on the R&amp;D cycle, are there any updates you can provide on the development of IQ 9 where that currently stands at this time? Is it still being developed or is it in testing phase? If you can provide any color there? Thank you.\u201d\n\nA2: \u201cYeah. We are actually working on IQ 9 at this time and IQ 9, our vision is basically obviously smaller, cheaper, faster, producing a lot more power than IQ 8. Right now, we are focused on a few areas. One is, we'd like to see how to reduce the footprint of the transformers, the \\[indiscernible\\] (00:49:10), the 600-volt AC FET devices through some semiconductor process innovation. GaN transistors are becoming widespread. GaN-on-GaN, GaN-on-silicon, they are becoming widespread.\u201d\n\nQ3: \u201cAnd just on the new acquisitions and the digital strategy, could you maybe talk about like what's the goal here in terms of reducing that soft cost? I think a couple in the solar developers have talked about $7,000 or $8,000 per customer of soft costs. So, is the idea here to kind of like bring it down similar to probably what the soft cost is in Europe and Australia or what's your thought process here? And I have just a quick follow-up after that as well. Thanks.**\u201d**\n\n**\u201c**Yeah. So, soft cost is an outcome of what our goal is. Our goal is to provide our installer partners with the best service possible, and so \u2013 installer partners actually as well as the homeowner. So, we have mapped out a very detailed journey of both how the entire installation process as well for both the installers as well as our homeowners starting with leads all the way through design, proposal, permitting, procurement, commissioning, installation commissioning, permission to operate O&amp;M, et cetera. And so, if we do an amazing job on that where we really create a very powerful platform and these acquisitions that we're talking about are important elements of that journey, then I think the natural outcome of that is going to be a reduction in the soft cost. But we are starting with a very clear focus that this is about bringing great value for our long-tail installer partners.\u201d\n\n**My thoughts:** \n\nStaying invested in a company post-earnings is normally not our strategy. We scan every company on the earnings calendar and dive in the fundamentals/growth of that company. If you find 3 solid companies which you want to gamble your money on per week, there is a possibility to earn 10% ROI on each of those companies. Investing in boomer company of which the stock increases 2% post-earnings is not interesting for us. It rather be +7% at least, or nothing. \n\nEnphase however is a different story. They keep beating their forecasts every quarter. There is enormous demand for their products and they a growing in supply and demand. \n\n\\- Management is amazing. The way Badri perceives the business is very client focused. They are well aware that this is a client focused business and quality and client experience are top priority. \n\n\\- With regards to future growth they have some very interesting things going on. IQ 8, which I expect to be finished during the 2nd quarter of this year. Then it is the job of the new CMO to promote the heck out of this. As Badri said in the call: \u201cpeople might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smarter storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.\u201d\n\n\\- There is so much growth opportunity in this company. And yes the P/E is high, but you must see Enphase as a tech company and not solar producer. Last quarter they hired 85 employees. \n\n\\- So our plan: keep this gem for one more quarter to see how their results are in the next quarter. Have they improved their semiconductors problem or not? Are they still beating the forecast or not. Then we\u2019ll see from there on. This weekend\u2019s plan: scan earnings calendar of next week to find the next gem \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n**Q1 2021 forecasts:** \n\nFor the first quarter of 2021, Enphase Energy estimates both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results as follows:\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be within a range of $280.0 million to $300.0 million; revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments\n\n\u2022 GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37.0% to 40.0%, as there are no remaining tariff refunds pending approval; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38.0% to 41.0%, excluding stock-based compensation expenses\n\n\u2022 GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $64.0 million to $67.0 million, including $22.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortization\n\n\u2022 Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $42.0 million to $45.0 million, excluding $22.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortization",

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this? When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers. For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well. The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.\n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit. When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of payment for your transaction. The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal?\n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above, Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments. To quote, PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues. It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

        "selftext": "**My positions:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sd68mdtiw9h61.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f25eb5196dcc9424332c2c1216a093ffbab2142\n\n**Disclaimer:** If you are a conservative investor you will find reading this a waste of time. Everything you read is highly questionable and accuracy of information is not guaranteed. No financial advice here. I have a significant long position in PSTH. The merger target and date could be incorrect. I\u2019m talking up my book. This is not a research report, just speculation by a heroin addict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis: There is two parts to this speculation**\n\nA. PSTH will merge with Stripe. (For these see A-Exhibits)\n\nB. The announcement will come on Feb 17th. (For these see B-Exhibits)\n\n**What is Stripe?** A payment processing company that competes with Square and PayPal. In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company ra ised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $36 billion. It is currently being valued at $70 billion or more. Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. I\u2019m very familiar with the Irish, and the duo are extremely smart and have European way of thinking and mannerisms. \n\n**Background:** I presented the speculative evidence for Stripe being the target in A-Exhibits and timing in B-exhibits. A lot of these are scraped from various people who have done lots of digging. A speculative trade like this has high risk but also high reward. Nailing the timing on this would be tickets to retirement for some. So SPACs move massively on any news of discussion with a good target. Stripe is in my opinion as sweet honey. I highly doubt that Ackman and all those big investors like Guggenheim would invest in a SPAC without having a solid short list. I think their short list had Bloomberg and Stripe on it. They flirted with AirBnB and Coinbase just to see their chances. If any of those happened or a new sweet target emerged then they would do a quick second SPAC. They used PSTH to grab attention of other companies and see what they can attract for their future SPACs. Kind of like what Chamat did. I speculate that Stripe was their target and Stripe was just spending time getting ready for the Feb 17th announcement. All this is speculation. I also have read speculations about StarLink and Plaid and those really didn\u2019t hold any water. Collison brothers\u2019 way of running their companies has been very European like. Very cooperative and trusting of the process. They didn\u2019t mind giving a big chunk of their company to Y-combinator. They didn\u2019t mind hiring agitators. They just seem to operate like they live in Ireland and everyone is trustable. They are not used to dealing with NYC sharks. They are easy prey for a top predator like AckFuckingMan.  \n\n**Exhibit A-1: Stripe has been going on a hiring spree. 973 job postings vs last year 260** \n\n[https://stripe.com/jobs/search](https://stripe.com/jobs/search)\n\nBelow is how their site looks now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flnlxlslw9h61.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87db6dabc36405f78023b03d4bc034796b530c2f\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is how their postings looked in April of 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4i8x16pnw9h61.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=669af8e7fa5c787bf7d50335fbcf5d438fc95792\n\nHiring needs money! They are obviously seeing a huge injection of money coming their way. \n\n**Exhibit A-2: Privacy statement of Stripe updated** \n\nNew text added regarding \u201cother entity which buys us\u201d to their privacy statement. \n\nBelow is the privacy statement once updated:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrtoyxcqw9h61.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86a4c8d22787ba4f57c3d79d5afd555895de24e4\n\nBelow is how it looked in early 2020: (see it is missing that sentence)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img w9qghpxrw9h61...*\n\n**Exhibit A-3: Bill Ackman follows 190 people on twitter and oddly 3 are stripe et al**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf79j3ntw9h61.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1595fba57ccfa27260e3d53f21e8b7b5140ce393\n\n**Exhibit A-4: Ackman mentioned that he talked to stripe** \n\n[https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917](https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917)   Minute 15:17\n\nStripe wasn\u2019t ready to go public but they sure seem to be working towards it. Bill mentions \u201cManagement\u201d, \u201cInfrastructure\u201d, and \u201csystems\u201d. So that ties into exhibit A-1.

Jackie was the head of capital for square and stepped down. She has also been liking tweets from Ackman. \n\n**Exhibit A-10: Peter Collison interacted with posts about SPAC on Twitter.** \n\nThose were on Jan 8th. They have been deleted since.

Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won\u2019t meet our expected timeframe\u201d-* \n\n**Exhibit B-2: The two meetings are right one after another.

This is the day that PSTH shares jumped \\~6% on no news. Insiders buying? There was a lot of unexplained excitement on that day both in twitter behaviour of parties involved and price of PSTH. \n\n**Exhibit B-6: 13G filing by PSH**\n\nNews of raising more money coming out just now! See 13G filled on **2/12/21** after hours. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm) \n\nI think there is a lot of confusion about this. People are saying that it is PSH increasing the PIPE, and this is pointing to a bigger deal. I think this is false. I think for that you need an S-3 filing. This is obviously above my paygrade and we need a securities lawyer to decipher this for us. What is noteworthy is that this simple news made **the stock move 10% and warrants move 25%.** So you see any small hints of positive news make this baby move massively.  \n\n**=================================================================================**\n\n**Notable Institutional Investors:**\n\nPERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.  200,000,100 $5,544,002,772\n\nGUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC    22,000,000 $499,180,000\n\nBAUPOST GROUP LLC     12,707,924 $352,264,000\n\nCITADEL ADVISORS LLC     2,167,041 $49,170,000\n\nPEAK6 INVESTMENTS LLC **(CALL)**    577,400 $16,006,000 **(New Position)**\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC    299,498 $8,302,000 **(New Position)**\n\nIt is speculated by redditors that the prominent wealthy investor that Bill Ackman was talking about is either Warren B, Bill G, or the Warlton family.

        "selftext": "So most of the stocks posted that people like for the long term have some insane floats, about 1 billion+ and sure some have market caps that are low, usually 200-300m or less but even with low market caps I can't see a stock price rising higher than $1-$3 (this assumes ofc that the company is very very good for the future and truly can change things) because of the shares outstanding or am I wrong?\n\nNow TSNP kind of doesn't match up with what I said about in that it went from pennyland to dollar land even though it has 5b market cap and 3.9b shares outstanding but lets say a company like TSNP (ignore the HUMBL ticker change for a sec) if they were to stay the same company how much higher than $1 can they get with a 5b market cap and 3.9b shares outstanding? The only way I would see it going insane price is if they do something game changing which personally after ticker change I see them changing the game when compared to paypal so for this example I would say it def has potential to go much much higher than $1 if they execute correctly but assuming it was an ordinary company how much higher could it get with a market cap and shares outstanding that large?\n\nSome other examples is OZSC (1b cap, 3b shares outstanding) SNPW (139m, 966m shares outstanding), INND (215m cap, 3b shares outstanding).\n\nEach of those companies need to literally be game changers in order to get past $1 no? Like when I look at the Apples, Teslas, Amazons, and Microsofts of the world and other big time blue chip companies most have 1B shares outstanding or less but those companies are like literally game changer\n\nSome of these OTC stocks already have shares outstanding 1B+ and they are nowhere near the level of those blue chip stocks, so if these OTC stocks to have insane share prices they would need market caps that are just as big if not more than blue chip stocks so really my main goal behind this post is to try to find some sort of exit strategy for these \"long hold OTC\" stocks.  \n\nFinal summary: In my opinion, since OTC stocks have super high caps and shares, if they are truly a long term hold they should be able to reach $1 even with those high caps/shares BUT to get past $1 and get to $10 $50 $100+ is near impossible unless they completely change the game like the blue chips mentioned above, therefore, isn't it smart to pull out of these pennystocks once they reach dollar land because the odds of them \"changing the game\" is prob super low. \n\nWhats your thoughts? I understand most people trade pennystocks for a day or less, while others like to play the long term and wait for all PRs/catalysts before deciding what to do, for the people who like long term pennystocks do you plan to hold after dollar land and if so how high you think these insanely high caps/shares can go?\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.\n\n&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday\u2019s close of $325. In last week\u2019s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday\u2019s premarket.\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week\u2019s 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June\n\n&gt; * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He\u2019ll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a \u201ctransition period to be determined by the board.\u201d Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck\u2019s chief executive since January 2011.\n\n&gt; * Frazier\u2019s retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car\n\n&gt; * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday\u2019s premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called \u201cApple Car,\u201d which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech\n\n&gt; * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Biden signals flexibility on Covid stimulus\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers to \u201cact fast\u201d on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan but also signaled flexibility. Changes he indicated he would consider include limiting proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which directionally could draw support from Republicans who want a much smaller package. Biden told lawmakers in private comments Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cnot married\u201d to an absolute number for the overall bill but wants them to \u201cgo big\u201d on pandemic relief and \u201crestore the soul of the country.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/7HyJrkD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4D1ZzFL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/xv1RdWa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/I3EtDfQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/oDg1a06.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kyPHRhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrLePbl.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qHQpeLy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XvyTr2i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7qIfxls.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ygir5N.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jOyOkJG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WnzRtqa.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ouXy3Xv.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gBzCmaO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/f8ItHFz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/SS9oUVD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-canada-goose-ebay-paypal-qualcomm-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Canada Goose (GOOS)** \u2013 Canada Goose shares surged more than 15% in the premarket after the outerwear maker beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

        "selftext": "https://m.imgur.com/gallery/4ihSh22\n\n# Strategy\n&gt;...That was the unseen message. I mean, nobody ever said it that way. So, I have seen half of the United States\u2019 talent basically put off to the side. - Warren Buffet\n\nI find that the most valuable investing tool is to pay attention to the obvious and to keep investments simple to understand. I expect a few things to happen throughout the years as I invest, and I try to be sensible about those changes. Time is on my side.\n\n- Industrial processes will improve greatly by way of automation technology.\n- Research into materials improve, in order to solve significant challenges related to global climate &amp; health.\n- US women and minorities education rates will cause dramatic changes in economic opportunity.\n- Financial regulations will lower to adjust for the level of trust that cybersecurity applications bring to its system.\n- Trade between the US &amp; Mexico will increase.\n- Cloud computing will serve as a bridge for many economic frontiers.\n\nAs the saying goes, invest in what you know. So let\u2019s get on with it, technology and industrials.\n\nMy strategy is to build an engine that I can debate about and get behind the wheel on. It can change over time, but it\u2019s the critical thought process that matters at the end. It\u2019s an engine that I want to trust to run through the good times and bad so that I am not nearly as concerned with current financial statuses at certain periods of time.\n \n## Cash (15-30%)\n\nThe most critical element to my portfolio is a constant rate of cash per month. This is a \u201cjoker card\u201d, if you will, where eventually the growing cash pile will eventually be invested when the opportunity is right and resets to 0. This holding is reserved for highly desired investment opportunities like:\n\n- Impossible Foods\n- MOD Pizza\n- Reddit\n- RH (don\u2019t hurt me)\n\nIt is a pile of cash that searches for a wonderful company at a fair price. \n\n## Industrial (20-35%)\n\nThis element to my portfolio helps me sleep at night. The goal here is to try to capture important elements to a healthier North American industrial sector. The name of the game is **quality** and to capture broader markets. \n\nAt the speculative level, the economic consequences of industrial automation should start to gain more impact. One could argue that the value of precision measurement will increase as machines handle more material, for example.\n\n1. AMD - _Computing_\n2. Mettler-Toledo - _Precision Scales &amp; Analytic Instruments_\n3. Ecolab - _Sanitation, water, energy, and air management_\n4. Kansas City Southern - _Mexican-American Trade_\n5. Rockwell Automation - _Industrial controls_\n\n  \n## Cloud Compute (45-60%)\n\nThese are my general bets on technology. I found it enormously challenging to go through the exercise of selecting a stock between industry leaders like Square &amp; PayPal or Alphabet &amp; Apple.\n\nI\u2019ve included where these companies are consequential, and why they will sustain growth as a result.\n\n1. Pinterest - _Discovery Engine (Women driven markets)_\n2. Square - _Financial Access (Underbanking solutions)_\n3. Alphabet - _Internet (Distribution of education technology)_\n4. Fastly - _Networking (Serverless compute)_\n\n  \n## ETFS and Watchlist (10-20%)\n\nThese holdings are held in order to track certain industry \u201cbets\u201d like robotics, electric grids, cyber security, gaming, semiconductors and the like. The point is to diversify almost excessively here and to observe changes over time.\n\n- FTXL First Trust US Semiconductor\n- CIBR First Trust Cybersecurity\n- GRID First Trust Smartgrid Infrastructure\n\n- ARKQ Ark Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics\n- ARKG Ark Genomic Revolution\n- ARKF Ark Fintech Innovation\n\n- ICLN iShares Global Clean Energy\n- EWW iShares Mexico\n- SOXX iShares US Semiconductor\n- IYM iShares Basic Materials\n\n- Berkshire\n- Tesla\n- Sherwin Williams\n- James Hardie PLC\n- AirBnB\n- Elastic",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Last week, I bought 2X Pypl Bull Put Spreads 270/260 9.06/5.86 credit of $320/each. Yesterday, I wanted to buy a third spread of 280/270 8.45/5.45 for another credit of $300. E-Trade was acting weird so I ended up using Power E-Trade to buy the third spread but instead of opening a new sell/buy put position, it opened a new sell and closed one of my prior 270 from last week. I understand that it is probably net/net at the time of purchase but now my account shows a spread for 280/260 with a cost of 8.45/5.86 which seem really unfavorable vs my prior position. Am I looking at this wrong? Did I realize $300 for the 280/270 trade and now have a potential to earn 8.45 - 5.86 = $259 in additional premium?",

But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, BNY, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. \n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit. \n\nThoughts?",

Online shopping is expected to stay at the current elevated levels** because it is more convenient (easier and saves time).\n\n2.Retailers are rapidly adapting to this new landscape and accelerating the pace of digitisation by 3-5 years.\n\nThe strong launch of PYPL's service is another data point which suggests BNPL demand in the US is very strong. It's early momentum in this market is a reflection of PYPL's substantial scale and incumbent market position.\n\nI'm personally expecting 100% increase in GMV. Afterpay (one of Affirm's competitors) has EVERY SINGLE YEAR has increased its GMV by 100+%. This will be Affirm's first earnings call, and once people start seeing Affirm as the next Afterpay, this stock is going to be $250 by the end of this year.\n\n**Agitated Advisor's December 2021 Price Target :$250 (implying 95% upside).**\n\nObligatory this isn't financial advice, that I'm invested already, and do your own DD, but I've seen the success of Afterpay ($8 to currently $140) in the space of a year, and getting in now with AFRM before it does the same.",

Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, February 4, 2021**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending this week\u2019s remarkable rally further. The market\u2019s quick recovery is encouraging given last week was the market\u2019s worst since October. Market participants largely shook off concerns over heightened volatility following last week\u2019s historic, Reddit-fueled rally in stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC and turned their attention back to corporate earnings reports and positive news on the vaccine and stimulus fronts coming out of Washington. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.12% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.18% up, and the Dow (DIA) closed 1.10% up.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate voted to move forward with a process to fast track approval of President Biden\u2019s new coronavirus stimulus package. The Senate opened debates on budget resolutions for the fiscal year of 2021, with the intention of including parts of Biden\u2019s stimulus package with a simple majority.  In Congress, budget resolutions only need a simply 50+1 majority rather than the 60-vote supermajority required to pass major bills. In this manner, Democrats would be able to pass the stimulus without Republican support. The House of Representatives is expected to adopt a similar move soon. \"With this budget resolution, the Democratic Congress is paving the way for the landmark Biden-Harris coronavirus package that will crush the virus and deliver real relief to families and communities in need,\" Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement. As a reminder, in the Senate, there remains a 50/50 split between Democrats and Republicans, but Kamala Harris, as the Vice President, has the power to cast a tie-breaking vote if need be.\n\nToday, the White House announced a plan to ship coronavirus vaccines directly to retail pharmacies like CVS in an effort to boost the pace of vaccinations. The move is expected to raise the [weekly supply of shots by 1 million to 11.5 million.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-increased-vaccine-supply-initial-launch-of-the-federal-retail-pharmacy-program-and-expansion-of-fema-reimbursement-to-states/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Some notable earnings after the bell are: Snap (SNAP), Gilead (GILD), Pinterest (PINS) and Peloton (PTON) after market close.\n* Weekly Unemployment claims came in at 779,000, below the 830,000 estimate.\n* Ford (F) said it will cut its output of F-150 pickups due to a shortage in the semiconductors needed.\n* Gamestop (GME) and other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d continue to be under heavy pressure.

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Nokia Corporation \n\nFinancial Statement Release\n4 February 2021 at 08:00 (CET +1)\n\n \n\nNokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and Full Year 2020\n\nSolid margin performance driven by customer demand in North America\n\n \n\n5% year-on-year decrease in reported net sales in Q4, primarily due to Mobile Access, as declines in network deployment and planning services were partially offset by growth in radio access products\n1% growth in constant currency net sales in Q4\nContinued improvements in our Mobile Access portfolio; strengthening roadmaps, reducing product costs and improving product performance; commitment to invest in R&amp;D to drive product leadership\nIncrease in Mobile Access gross margin in Q4, primarily driven by improved 5G gross margin, partially offset by a project-related loss provision\nPositive operating profit, on a reported basis, in Q4 and full year 2020\nNon-IFRS operating profit in Q4 benefited by approximately EUR 250 million, due to the timing of revenue recognition and a net positive fluctuation in Nokia\u2019s venture fund investments\nStrong free cash flow in Q4 and full year 2020 benefited from an early customer payment of approximately EUR 0.5 billion, which was expected in Q1 2021\nDerecognized EUR 2.9 billion of Finnish deferred tax assets, which are not lost\nReiterated outlook for 2021 comparable operating margin of 7-10% and provided new outlook for net sales and free cash flow\nBoard does not propose a dividend or dividend authorization for the financial year 2020\n \n\nThis is a summary of the Nokia Corporation financial report for Q4 and full year 2020 published today. The complete financial report for Q4 and full year 2020 with tables is available at www.nokia.com/financials. Investors should not rely on summaries of our financial reports only, but should review the complete financial reports with tables.\n\n \n\nPEKKA LUNDMARK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ON Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2020 RESULTS\n\n\nNokia delivered a solid Q4 to end 2020 at the high end of our Outlook range. We saw healthy gross margin and operating margin performance for both Q4 and full year 2020, supported by a regional mix shift towards the higher margin North America region and by our ongoing R&amp;D efforts to enhance product quality and cost competitiveness.\n\nFrom a business group perspective, in Q4 and full year 2020, our gross margin improvement was primarily driven by Networks, as was our full year operating margin performance. In Q4, our operating profit performance benefited by approximately EUR 250 million from two unexpected, yet significant drivers: a timing benefit of approximately EUR 150 million as we recognized net sales at the very end of the quarter, which we had expected in 2021; and we had a net positive fluctuation in Nokia\u2019s venture fund investments of approximately EUR 100 million.\n\nThe healthy close to the year does not change our earlier communicated view for Nokia-level operating margin expected in 2021.\n\nNet sales for Q4 were down 5% on a reported basis and up 1% in constant currency and for full year 2020 they were down 6% on a reported basis and down 4% in constant currency.\n\nNokia delivered strong cash performance in Q4 and full year 2020, benefitting from a large customer payment that had been expected in Q1 2021, marking the third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Additionally, our liquidity position continues to be solid.\n\nFinancial improvement in Mobile Access was clear in both Q4 and full year 2020 results, reflecting our ongoing efforts to strengthen the competitiveness and cost position of our mobile radio products. Overall, we saw growth in radio access products in Q4 and full year 2020, with growth in 5G partially offset by decreases in legacy radio access products.\n\n5G gross margin increased due to product cost reduction, partly helped by higher ReefShark shipment volumes. Our aim was to be above 35% for our KPI on shipments of our \u201c5G Powered by ReefShark\u201d portfolio; we ended the year at 43% and we remain on track to realize 70% by the end of 2021. This underlines the ongoing progress with our Mobile Networks turnaround and, as I said in Q3, we will invest whatever it takes to win in 5G.  Completing the turnaround in Mobile Networks remains our top priority for 2021, and these visible signs of progress give me confidence that we are on the right track but there is still work to be done.\n\nOur Enterprise business delivered another good set of results giving a solid foundation to build on. Q4 Enterprise net sales were up 1% in reported and 5% in constant currency. For full year 2020, they were up 11% in reported and 14% in constant currency, reflecting our leadership position in many areas, including in private wireless. We announced key partnerships with AT&amp;T and Verizon for private wireless and won 79 new customers in Q4. We now have 260 private wireless customers. Public sector demand remains robust and we announced a US federal government cyber deal after the quarter end in mid-January.\n\nAt the end of 2020, we announced a new operating model to better align us with the needs of our customers and to better maintain and achieve technology leadership in the areas where we choose to compete.\n\nPleasingly we already have strong technology leadership positions in many key areas of our new business groups.  In Network Infrastructure we have industry-leading FP4-based products and in Cloud and Network Services we are jointly developing transformational cloud-native 5G core solutions for CSPs and Enterprise customers. In our Mobile Networks business, together with Elisa and Qualcomm, we hold the worldwide 5G speed record.\n\nThese are encouraging results, however, as I said in Q3, we expect 2021 to be challenging, a year of transition, with meaningful headwinds due to market share loss and price erosion in North America.\n\nAdditionally, as I said, delivering on our new operating model for a strong and sustainable long-term business requires us to make further 5G R&amp;D investments in 2021, meaning we will sacrifice some short-term margin to ensure leadership in 5G.\n\nConsidering these elements, we maintain our comparable operating margin outlook for 2021 and \u2013 as new items \u2013 give an outlook for net sales and free cash flow for 2021. As previously stated, we intend to provide a long-term outlook latest at Capital Markets Day on March 18.\n\nRegarding dividend, we are pleased with Nokia\u2019s recent operational performance and satisfied that we have strengthened our cash position. However, with the focus on increased investments in 5G and strategic areas, while continuing to establish a track record of sustainable cash generation, the Board does not propose a dividend or dividend authorization for the financial year 2020. We intend to provide an update on our dividend policy latest at Capital Markets Day.\n\nWe took important steps in 2020 to accelerate roadmaps, improve execution and create a new way of working, which will enable Nokia to return to a sustainable long-term financial performance. We know we have our work cut out for us in 2021, but the new Group Leadership Team has hit the ground running. As announced earlier, we will go deep into each of our business groups at our Capital Markets Day to discuss specific targets and action plans.\n\nI want to conclude by thanking everyone at Nokia. This has been a year of incredible change where our personal resilience as well as technology has been tested like never before. I am extremely proud of our team, their commitment and their achievements. Thank you.",

I rather pass plays such as GME, AMC and BB and stick with companies that are bringing big revenues even in the mist of the pandemic.\n\nI think that QCOM will beat to the upside, and give a good forecast. As a result it could see a very nice move up after hours after it reports earnings.  It has done so in the last 4 quarters.\n\nIf you are going to do a YOLO play, may as well to be with a market bellwether stock, not with a company that is close to bankruptcy.\n\nDo you agree or Disagree on QCOM?

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

It is likely that this will continue to inflate as excitement grows.\n\nThe suggestion that the company is to list on NASDAQ is an indication that they are more confident in their technology and it is getting closer to commercialisation, they just need a bit more capital to make it happen.\n\nEnd game?\n\nIf, and its a big if, this company is to have the platform which goes someway to replacing silicon in the future then we all know the value.\n\nPotential risks?\n\nRealistically, there is a chance another company is one step ahead of the curve and their technology will never make it in the future.\n\nSome close links to Chinese companies - future restrictions could hamper some of their JVs.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.\n\n&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday\u2019s close of $325. In last week\u2019s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday\u2019s premarket.\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week\u2019s 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June\n\n&gt; * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He\u2019ll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a \u201ctransition period to be determined by the board.\u201d Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck\u2019s chief executive since January 2011.\n\n&gt; * Frazier\u2019s retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car\n\n&gt; * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday\u2019s premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called \u201cApple Car,\u201d which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech\n\n&gt; * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Biden signals flexibility on Covid stimulus\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers to \u201cact fast\u201d on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan but also signaled flexibility. Changes he indicated he would consider include limiting proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which directionally could draw support from Republicans who want a much smaller package. Biden told lawmakers in private comments Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cnot married\u201d to an absolute number for the overall bill but wants them to \u201cgo big\u201d on pandemic relief and \u201crestore the soul of the country.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/7HyJrkD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4D1ZzFL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/xv1RdWa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/I3EtDfQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/oDg1a06.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kyPHRhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrLePbl.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qHQpeLy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XvyTr2i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7qIfxls.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ygir5N.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jOyOkJG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WnzRtqa.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ouXy3Xv.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gBzCmaO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/f8ItHFz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/SS9oUVD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-canada-goose-ebay-paypal-qualcomm-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Canada Goose (GOOS)** \u2013 Canada Goose shares surged more than 15% in the premarket after the outerwear maker beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, February 3, 2021**\n\nStocks continued pushing higher Wednesday as market participants continued to digest corporate earring results and increasingly more positive data on coronavirus cases, the pace of vaccinations, and stimulus discussions in Washington. Alongside the rally, stocks that are favored by social media users continued under pressure as the battle between short-sellers and retail traders continues.\n\nShares of mega-cap stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) continued advancing on the backs of positive corporate earnings results. After reporting the company\u2019s first $100 billion revenue quarter, Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos announced he was stepping down from his role as CEO saying, \u201cI\u2019m excited to announce that this Q3 I\u2019ll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.\u201d Amazon Web Services CEO Andrew Jassy will take over as CEO. Shares of Amazon dropped around 2% today despite the positive earnings, but we suspect the shares will climb right back up. Shares of Alphabet gapped up 7% today on the back of their earnings report.\n\nMeanwhile, discussions for additional fiscal stimulus carried on in Washington, D.C. On Tuesday, the Democratically-controlled Senate narrowly voted to open debate for a budget resolution for the 2021 fiscal year, with an eye toward advancing additional coronavirus relief aid with a simple majority instead of the 60 votes needed for most legislation in the chamber. In Congress, budget resolutions only need a simply 50+1 majority rather than the 60-vote supermajority required to pass major bills. \n\nToday, the White House announced a plan to ship coronavirus vaccines directly to retail pharmacies like CVS in an effort to boost the pace of vaccinations. The move is expected to raise the [weekly supply of shots by 1 million to 11.5 million.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-increased-vaccine-supply-initial-launch-of-the-federal-retail-pharmacy-program-and-expansion-of-fema-reimbursement-to-states/)\n\nWe are happy to report that after hitting record-highs in coronavirus infections, deaths, and hospitalizations, the numbers have steadily declined in the past weeks. After a record-high of 300,000 infections on January 8, the US reported around 111,000 cases on Sunday, the lowest number since early November, according to Johns Hopkins University. Fingers crossed the trend can be maintained as the pace of vaccinations increases.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* On Wednesday, companies including Qualcomm (QCOM), eBay (EBAY), PayPal (PYPL) and GrubHub (GRUB) are scheduled to report quarterly results after market close.\n* After announcing that the new Tesla (TSLA) Model S and X would have a gaming system built into the car, reports are surfacing that AMD may be supplying the chips [https://www.benzinga.com/tech/21/02/19473529/tesla-may-be-using-amd-gpu-in-new-model-s-x-for-gaming](https://www.benzinga.com/tech/21/02/19473529/tesla-may-be-using-amd-gpu-in-new-model-s-x-for-gaming)\n* Despite recent volatility and worries of an anti-monopoly crackdown by the Chinese government, Alibaba (BABA) climbed around 3.5% today after reporting positive earnings\n* Amgen (AMGN) target raised by Cantor  Fitzgerald from $280 to $295. Stock currently around $234\n* After posting its first every $100b quarter, Amazon (AMZN) received a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $4,250 at Buy.

Stock currently around $40\n   * Deutsche Bank from $42 to $50\n   * Needham &amp; Co. from $44 to $46\n* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) with a host of target raises. Stock currently around $177. Consensus price target around $220 at Buy.\n* Qualcomm (QCOM) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $155 to $175 at Buy. Stock currently around $163\n* Twilio (TWLO) target raised by Keycorp from $350 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $384\n* UPS with two target raises.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.\n\n&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday\u2019s close of $325. In last week\u2019s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday\u2019s premarket.\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week\u2019s 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June\n\n&gt; * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He\u2019ll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a \u201ctransition period to be determined by the board.\u201d Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck\u2019s chief executive since January 2011.\n\n&gt; * Frazier\u2019s retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car\n\n&gt; * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday\u2019s premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called \u201cApple Car,\u201d which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech\n\n&gt; * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Biden signals flexibility on Covid stimulus\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers to \u201cact fast\u201d on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan but also signaled flexibility. Changes he indicated he would consider include limiting proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which directionally could draw support from Republicans who want a much smaller package. Biden told lawmakers in private comments Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cnot married\u201d to an absolute number for the overall bill but wants them to \u201cgo big\u201d on pandemic relief and \u201crestore the soul of the country.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/7HyJrkD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4D1ZzFL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/xv1RdWa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/I3EtDfQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/oDg1a06.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kyPHRhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrLePbl.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qHQpeLy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XvyTr2i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7qIfxls.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ygir5N.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jOyOkJG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WnzRtqa.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ouXy3Xv.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gBzCmaO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/f8ItHFz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/SS9oUVD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* SAVA\n* APXT\n* VGAC\n* XL\n* AVXL\n* CCIV\n* DKNG\n* DOGE.X\n* MNKD\n* PYPL\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-canada-goose-ebay-paypal-qualcomm-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Canada Goose (GOOS)** \u2013 Canada Goose shares surged more than 15% in the premarket after the outerwear maker beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
