        "selftext": "I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR. Stonks only go up.",

        "selftext": "I have always been an indexer\u2014my 401k and Roth IRA are made up of low-fee index funds, and I am mostly invested in the S&amp;P 500 (with some small cap, some mid cap, international and very little bond). \n\nBut lately I've been wondering: why should I not start investing in just a \\*handful\\* of great companies that have \\*way\\* outperformed index funds over the past 20 years and have consistently returned value to shareholders over the long-term?

        "selftext": "The Nasdaq is basically flat year to date. All the FAANG stocks are near all time highs. Facebook, Netflix and Google all missed on EPS estimates. Apple is likely to be hit even worse (sales are down and stores are closed) which leaves Amazon as the only member of FAANG that is likely to beat on earnings.\n\nHere's the thing, according to earnings calls and the current economic trend, they were only beginning to experience negative effects for the last few weeks of the quarter. GDP declined by 4.8% this quarter, whereas economists are projecting a decline of 30% to 40% next quarter. \n\nIf we look at tech across the board, we have some winners like Microsoft and Zoom, but chip makers like AMD (which met EPS estimates but didn't beat) and Qualcom both delivered poor guidance for coming quarters. AMD has been rallying back to all time highs. Nvidia is also near all time highs. Yet, despite the relative strength in the tech sector, the current trend of earnings, economic forecasts and guidance (or lack thereof) strongly suggests that tech will take a huge hit to earnings in coming quarters.\n\nLet's look at how concentrated the S&amp;P is in the very top tech stocks [https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg) This blows the dot com boom out of the water. Now consider how much of the S&amp;P the rest of the tech stocks account for.\n\nAll of this is to say, watch these tech stocks closely.  If they fall, the indexes will go with them. There is a high probability they will lead the next leg of the drop.\n\nAlso, here's my take on the long term value of these stocks. The US is moving closer and closer towards adopting basic income. Nothing is guaranteed, but if anything has made the case for increased automation coupled with basic income, it's the current circumstance. Such a policy would likely necessitate a rise in corporate taxes or a VAT. That's a direct hit to earnings of notorious tax evaders like Amazon. In addition, basic income would give working class people more leverage in holding out for higher pay because they wouldn't be weighing job offers against total destitution. This too would detract heavily from future earnings.\n\nAfter the 2000 crash, the Nasdaq didn't recover to the highs for 15 years. If you look at that S&amp;P chart I posted, two of the top five stocks were Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft took 16 years to recover to its highs and Intel never full recovered.\n\nTherefor, I advise extreme caution in this environment. Do not be shamed out of taking profits near all time highs if that's what you personally feel comfortable with. I won't say it's wrong to hold if you're ready to accept the risk, however, just because these companies are good \"blue chips stocks\" that doesn't mean that they're low risk or no risk, regardless of your time horizon. That's just my two cents.",

        "selftext": "With Tesla moving back towards its ATH, I thought I would provide my perspective on the supreme-meme stock. Before the Tesla cultists jump on me and spam ban requests for my account, I want to give a bit of background. I bought Tesla 10 years ago when it was less than 1/10 of todays price, and sold a few years ago for a profit. I love Tesla's products and would gladly buy one of their cars myself. However, this is strictly about the value of their stock which I feel is very overvalued right now. Those of you who think you are visionaries if you are just now buying this company in 2020, lol. You are very late to the party and at this point are being spoonfed a lot of ideas by the new mainstream that are not supported by deductive reasoning or data.\n\nBefore I go on, I am aware that Tesla does not follow fundamentals nearly as well as other stocks. The wild speculations and cult-like following make the short-term prospects for this stock very unpredictable. I am just attempting to make an educated guess about the long term performance of this stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Bull Thesis\n\n1. Tesla's cars are the best thing since sliced bread or the first iPhone. They have the highest owner satisfaction of any car, and will become the most prevalent car on earth in the future and monopolize the market\n2. Tesla is not just a car company, they are also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company. Thus they are a premium, innovative technology company more comparable to Apple than GM. They will monopolize several of these different markets\n3. The company is not profitable now, but its income will continue to grow exponentially in the future due to our society's moving to green technology, and Tesla's prime position to capitalize\n4. One fund manager (Cathy Wood) says she expects the stock to hit $7000 in the next 4 years (lol!)\n5. New factory in China = \\~1.5 billion Teslas sold (I'm being facetious)\n\nThe Bear Thesis\n\n1. Not much of a point in focusing on current fundamentals or TA, since based on its current stock price Tesla's market cap is larger than the 3 major US automakers combined. Everybody knows their current sales are nowhere near justifying this valuation\n2. We are on a 12 year bull run that many (most?) are predicting is over. In a recession/depression, the animal spirits that kept Tesla flush with cash despite their losses will fade away\n3. Also in a depression/recession, less people are buying expensive electric cars or new cars period\n4. Tesla investors want to believe it is a tech company, but a car manufacturer's profit margins are highly unlikely to ever match traditional \"tech companies\" (software &amp; electronics) in the future. There is a ton of competition, large overhead costs to produce and ship these products and the auto industry as a whole has been declining for years.\n5. Electric vehicles are limited by infrastructure. The world's population is mostly urbanized and increasingly so. Where do you charge an electric car for an hour+ if you live in a small apartment, as is the case for nearly the entire millennial+ generation?\n6. Tesla will suffer due to rock bottom oil prices. Going green is nice but ultimately economics are the strong guiding hand towards electric cars. It appears that oil will be cheap for at least a few years. Additionally, Trump is likely to win the next election (I don't like him myself, but I think this is the harsh reality). His presence will not benefit green companies like Tesla for the next 4-5 years\n7. Government incentives that helped a lot with their early growth are drying up\n8. Tesla has never paid a dividend and the company is very leveraged. Comparing it to other brand-name tech companies is silly based on this fact alone. Just look at their 10-k history, without the dreamer aspect it just looks atrocious. There is a reason this 17 year old (they are 17 years old and still not profitable!) company's debt is still junk rated by the major credit rating agencies. In contrast, Apple has had a net income of well over a billion dollars since 2005, before the iPhone even came out. Pretty much every other big tech company is the same, massive sustained profits for a long time.\n9. By the way, since they were rated junk prior to March 22 Tesla does not qualify for Fed bailout money if things start to look bad\n10. Tesla is seen as a leader in a few green fields right now largely *because they are allowed operate at a loss.* Other companies do not have this same luxury and are expected to return big profits. Toyota can't just go full electric and operate at giant losses, their shareholders will go nuts. Tesla has been allowed to do this for a surprisingly long time because of animal spirits. As soon as these green energy fields become profitable and the infrastructures start to take shape other companies will immediately jump aboard in droves. GM already has the Bolt which is actually a great electric city car. Volkswagen has spent tons of cash on EV development. I am sure as soon as total EV sales numbers become more than just a small niche their EV portfolio will take off, along with many other manufacturers\n11. \"Tesla is also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company\". I see this quote nearly everywhere Tesla is mentioned. None of those are profitable for Tesla and all of them have major competitors. I think it is unlikely for Tesla to be a monopoly in any of these fields. Facebook/IBM/Nvidia/Google/Amazon are way ahead of Tesla in anything AI related, they are all filled with Stanford/MIT/Berkeley etc. graduates with 6 figure salaries. Similar statements can be made for autonomy, in which Tesla is also not the leader. Ford and GM are doing surprisingly well in autonomy, arguably they are outpacing Tesla  [https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery)\n12. There are competing core car technologies. Hydrogen fuel cells, while inferior at the moment, have had several breakthroughs that may propel their green technology further in the next 10 years.  See here:  [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786). A lot of Tesla's value is hinged on their absolute dominance of their type of electric vehicle technology in the long term future. Challenges to this thesis substantially hurt their valuation\n13. \"The future is self-driving taxis everywhere, and they will all be Teslas.\" Another common point that is made, which is quite unlikely due to existing competition. Uber has a big leg up already. But also, going back to fuel cells: fuel cells recharge in the same time as gas, a couple min. Tesla's batteries take well over an hour to fully charge. Time charging is time not spent driving, which is lost revenue for a taxi. For now electric batteries are the winner, but it is not certain that in the long term future this will be the case\n14. Many Tesla cultists think the growth will be exponential and soon their cars will be in every driveway. Just like when the iPhone came out, it grew exponentially for a long time. This thinking is flawed. For one thing, the iPhone has saturated in market share. At this point in time almost everybody who wants a smartphone has one and the phones are starting to blend together, we are entering a new period for the phone industry. Tesla will saturate the same way, their market isn't even a new field like the iPhone's was since people already have good cars. Once the early adopters have their cars, Tesla becomes less of a novelty. You are already seeing this in rich neighborhoods in California. If 3 of my rich neighbors have Teslas I want something unique. This is one of the main reasons no car company has ever been totally dominant.\n15. Covid-19 will likely change the world, telecommuting will likely become much more of a thing. Jim Bianco talks about this a lot  (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M)). Historically a lot of people have never telecommuted and didn't know how to do it. Businesses needed to figure out how to structure themselves to operate in such a manner. Now that they have overcome this hurdle, telecommuting will become much more prevalent. Less driving to work = less need for an expensive car like a Tesla. For my weekend car, I'll stick with the manual transmission Porsche which is much more fun to drive for a couple miles\n16. China. They opened up a factory in China, great. China has never stolen anybody's technology before (/s). The iPhone, made in China but its sales there have always been crap. They only recently hit single digit millions in a country of over 1b since the government actively promotes domestic brands, and strongly takes their side in courts. If a Chinese company makes a \"Resla\" that is an exact copy of the Model 3 and then sues Tesla for IP violation, you better believe they will win in China. China is experiencing massive GDP losses right now and an uncertain future, both politically and economically. There are many talks right now of reducing our reliance on China due to Covid and punishing them. IMO this all does not bode well for future sales of Tesla's pricey electric cars\n\nTLDR:\n\nOverall, I think that Tesla is a great company that will do amazing things in the future. We just have a lot of \"dreamer\" investors right now who think Tesla has some kind of infinite magic sauce. People who bought the stock early did well. And in 8 years, I think you will probably be able to buy their stock for $500 and enjoy a decent dividend and some more steady growth to follow. I think the people buying and holding at today's prices will see more crashes and no/low profits for a long time. I can see it retesting and crossing the limits that were hit in the crash a month ago, as Covid is far from gone at this point. I would only buy this stock if it goes below $200, and definitely would sell right now if I was holding.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, i'm 22 years old and pretty new to this scene and i am wanting to invest some of my savings long term (10-20 years). \n\nMy thought process when looking though the stocks was to buy a few strong one which are most likely to do well in the future and have a few more risky ones which i might sell in the near future if they return a profit. However, i believe i have gone a bit overboard on the safe stocks and i have quite a lot so it might be hard to keep a track of them. i've thought about doing ETFs but i'm using trading 212 which dont offer the good ones like SPY, VOO, QQQ etc so i preferred going for individual stocks.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TK8542q](https://imgur.com/a/TK8542q)\n\nRun Down:\n\n**Airbus**: Bought this as a more risky stock was between this or boeing and after doing some research i came to the conclusion that airbus was the safer bet.\n\n**Google**: Pretty safe bet, bound to rise long term.\n\n**Amazon**: Pretty self explanatory, personally think it is a must for any portfolio\n\n**Apple**: Again same thought process as google and amazon\n\n**AstraZeneca**: Invested in these as more of a risky bet, I read recently that they had teamed up with oxford university to help develop a cure for COVID-19.\n\n**Delta Air Lines**: A stable (ish) airline bit more risky but hopeful it will rise after this crisis is over.\n\n**Greggs**: I just like greggs as a company being northern myself, i do also believe that they have some room to grow with them successfully going into the vegan pastry market with steak bakes and sausage rolls (which taste nice also). They are also expanding in the southern areas of the UK.\n\n**Global Clean Energy**: I wanted to have something in the clean energy sector but couldn't decide on a single stock so i bought this ETF instead.\n\n**UK Property**: Risky one which is why i haven't put much money on it.\n\n**JPMorgan**: Only one i didn't do much research on but from the few articles i read it look promising to rise long term.\n\n**Mastercard:** Pretty solid one to rise long term\n\n**Visa:** Pretty solid one to rise long term (couldnt decide on a single one so went for both V &amp; MA)\n\n**Microsoft:** Another one i believe should be in any portfolio.\n\n**Nike:** Wanted a stock in retail and nike seemed like the best, good financials and good marketing in the sector\n\n**NAT:** Was a low price and with the current situation bound to rise after the earning report in may\n\n**Nvidia**: I like the work they do with GPU an AI so i believe this will rise long term.\n\n**PXD**: An innovative company in their field from doing research it looks like they will be on the up.\n\n**RTX**: Another risky one but i'm gambling that the price will rise\n\n**Shell**: Unsure wether to sell this one or not, i've seen that they slashed their dividends so guessing it will be a slow recovery.\n\n**Simon Property Group**: Owns a lot of US Malls which open soon so hoping this will go up.\n\n**Sony:** Bought purely for the PS5, although they arn't doing well in other sectors i think this will help them considerably.\n\n**Tesla:** bit controversial but i like the innovation, didn't put that much money into it though as its quite unknown atm.\n\n**Disney**: Again bought for the long term.\n\nOther stocks i was looking at: Netflix, FB, Johnston &amp; Johnstone, Proctor &amp; Gamble, maybe mcdonalds.\n\nEssentially what i want to know is how this is looking for longterm investment, I plan on adding to microsoft and amazon every month, but i didn't know if this want a normal amount of stocks to have or am i better selling some and putting that money back into the big ones like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple etc.",

        "selftext": "My last post seemed to be quite well received, in it I discussed macro-principles which we are currently tasked with as an economy while bringing some technical analysis to the table as a means to share my analysis/what I'm considering as PT's for long term investing entries; today I'm simply sharing an update on findings &amp; what I believe to be a major tipping point in market movement moving forward. \\* Quick Disclaimer: No, I'm not here to act high and mighty or be crowned a fortune teller, nor am I 'making a killing' lol; movements had been forgiving up until Friday, got caught being greedy &amp; lackadaisically overconfident on someone else's analysis rather than staying hedged\\*\n\nFor those that didn't catch my last post - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fvjlin/economic_stagnation_financial_corruption_dying/). I brought into perspective what I believe to be many of the ways as to 'how' our markets have been propped up/inflated \\[while also highlighting some of what I believed to be key indicators in continuation of the rally that would leave many bears/greedy traders getting burned - ironically as I write this, even me\\] While also shedding light on how I believe the integrity of these means to inflating the markets would give way/lead to the continuation of sell offs to at least retest lows or visit even lower lows in the near future. \\*Yes I believe the Fed will continue intervention, but to the extent which prevents our markets from totally losing their value (which was at risk for awhile in March.) but, do I also believe that this can again reach a rate that is beyond their control/brings about a 'fire sale'? Certainly\\*\n\nFundamentals aside; I'll jump into technical's starting with the strongest tickers, ones within the NASDAQ - [NVDA](https://gyazo.com/a76ab526020ac4f08ee16f53a7e52117). Early in February NVDA hit LT resistance before tumbling down, being a tech company &amp; 'safe haven' withing the NASDAQ,  it was instantly getting bought up &amp; formed a 'bullish' support on its uptrend line (like many of the other tech stocks/ semi-conductors.) However, a bounce like this has simply created more momentum for the downside, in the current economic climate and how uncertain investors are, any panicked would send stock prices tumbling in the event of further liquidity issues/continued uncertainty of business growth as ER's are reported &amp; guidelines are disbanded. (Opening potential to revisit the lows being tested in 2018; perhaps even as low as their highs in 2000 - $80 for NVDA specifically.)\n\nOne of the most influential indicators of the markets current direction imo, financials, more specifically [JPM](https://gyazo.com/c175725b089868cb777764d60fc3ad80). Eager bulls have been getting trapped the entire way down since the descent began in late February, and even this 'uptrend' is looking WEAK. The blue line of LT support, again coincides with the breakout level of 2016 (If someone were truly bullish on the economy &amp; believed this pandemic is 'over-hyped', this most likely would've been their PT of entry.) JPM/Financials is also one of the few sectors which is clearly displaying a bear flag, opposed to the descending triangles/rising wedges seen across the other markets. To even humor the bulls, I've drawn a channel of the current 'uptrend,' However, the sell off's following the egregious ER from JPM had pushed it totally out of this trend channel (a sell signal) &amp; Friday ended with a back-test of this trend line, what I believe to be the last chance for bulls to sell out with a minimized loss/profits for en-entry at these lower PT's. Fair value on JPM, lay between $65-75; I don't believe we see the true market recovery until these at least some of these fair market values are hit. (Mind you, EPS was missed by -57% on JPM, meaning that on rudimentary calculation alone with their updated projections, Yearly EPSxPE = 'Fair Price,' \\~5.4 x 8.77 = $47.5) Yes this is offset by the 'ability to recover,' but would the majority of top tier investors seriously be inclined to pay double at the current share price in hopes that maybe in 2-3 years they'll be back to where they once were? It's an extremely uphill battle that I can't imagine any firm or investor would seriously put money into at these current valuations.\n\n\\- **BUT THE FED IS BUYING EVERYTHING YOU AUTIST.** Well, yeah they're currently repurchasing securities/debts in efforts to stabilize the markets, which they have done effectively at this point. But in order for the markets to stay 'stable,' this hail mary of a Prayer from Prez would actually have to come true (Opening economy May 1st, 'going back to normal.') &amp; somehow would have to continually reassure investors during these next weeks of shit ER's that \"it's just a blip.\" I personally believe smart money is still waiting for that sale, and those investors are going to be pumping in WAY more money to stabilize the markets after they've been enticed with true 'fire-sale' prices, much more so than the sheep/retail investors &amp; ST pumpers buying up the bear rally up until this point. (Which, in my opinion will coincide almost exactly with the time that the general public finally wakes up to realize that everything isn't going to just return to normal at the drop of a hat. \\~May/June.)\n\nNext I move to [BA](https://gyazo.com/8474bbe8ddd1902b74b89cad987581b2), a 'strong company' within the Dow Jones &amp; played a heavy roll in the rally of the Dow on Friday. Supports/Resistances - The Orange line is representative of LT resistance on Boeing at the $154 mark (this was the resistance broken which resulted in a parabolic move by BA - the move which resulted in almost tripling their share price during the months/years to follow.) Blue is 'bullish' support around the breakout level of mid-2013, and off screen I have a lower support at $70 - representative of their high in 2000 &amp; the first breakout point following the 2009 GFC in early 2012. The Descending Triangle/ rising wedge/bear flag (otherwise known as a 'bear pull-back') - Clear as day on daily, hourly, and even weekly charts &amp; Friday's close has put Boeing at SUCH a key spot, closed AH just below that 154 resistance line and fully completed it's 5th trajectory within the wedge/triangle. Typically, after the completion of a formation like this, the next move will be very powerful (as its been building momentum while bouncing up and down - imagine compressing a spring &amp; releasing it.) That said, based on financial situation &amp; the future prospects of BA, I would put their fair value price at $70 and if I were interested in investing in BA long term currently, I'd be waiting patiently for a light load at $100 &amp; adding more aggressively as the price draws closer to $70. A quick note on '[proof](https://gyazo.com/bdf7f172dbeb29c088873befcecae2ea)' of this over-valuation. BA was trading at about \\~$50 range during 2005, revenues were approx 50 Million; peak revenues were achieved in 2017-18 (\\~100 Million, double the revenues seen in 2005) yet BA managed to trade at a high of $445? Cut and dry, Boeing hasn't become that much more of a profitable company; surely not enough for serious investors to even considering buying in while the price was so inflated from 2016-2020. However, this begins to expand on a greater underlying effect on these prices; and the fact that the market is no longer only driven by ER's &amp; future projections, but that it more commonly reflects our economy (or the consumers perception of our economy) more than ever. Simply put, Americans hear trump talk about never letting Boeing fail/ \"how great Boeing is for our economy, we need to make more jobs,\" and all these damn sheep buy in, driving up the price.. Now is an investor that got in early going to complain about this? Absolutely not, they're gonna ride the wave and make fkin LOOT on the silly sheep driving the price up to kingdom-come. Now the same is true as they exit their positions, this ENTIRE week Boeing saw negative net flow from large-scale orders; firms/smart money/etc selling off to the sheep willing to still pay for an inflated price tag, just like we watched happen in 2008...\n\nAnother Example - [LYV](https://gyazo.com/f225f80c63ea2f353eb1d9768f9f5a19). Live Nations Entertainment (Company which hosts music shows/festivals/etc), this company's performance is dependent on consumer spending, and IMO is one of the best reflections of the bull trap playing out in the markets currently. $30 support coincides with the breakout level which was finally crossed in 2016, again; meaning, any perma-bulls that don't believe our economic impact will be very significant at all would've been scooping shares here (and even traders which have been deep diving on TA &amp; saw this key support area being approached, knowing the resulting bounce very well could create FOMO &amp; a nice return during the early stage of the rally.) Consumer spending is going to be demolished, and any investor (outside of sheep that have attended a live nation show &amp; think 'Oh it'd be cool to own them, it was just at a high of $70/share, I wanna go to a concert when this quarantine is over, surely they'll bounce back') know this &amp; that their outlook for the upcoming year is TERRIBLE. Live nations is about to lose a FUCK load of money, and the gov't sure as hell isn't backing that; what happens when they cancel shows &amp; cannot refund their consumers? The outlook is one I cannot see any sane firm/investor touching with a ten foot poll right now.\n\nThe plat de r\u00e9sistance, [SPY](https://gyazo.com/854bb2b1bd62fdd1e490759209f91dfa). Does it surprise me that this week was a another green week following, \"the greatest market comeback since 1934.\" as claimed by news &amp; DT himself? Not at all. Rising wedge, 5th bounce hit and rejected resistance of 288.5 today, this is what I view as the tipping point, rejecting that resistance was absolutely massive &amp; unless Monday comes around with a gap up from the futures, I believe the highs of this rally are in.\n\nTLDR; The markets are at their tipping point, I believe we begin to slow bleed or enter phase two of the blood bath following Friday's rejection of 288.5 (For MANY stocks, this equated to a back-test of their 'uptrends' and a 5th bounce within their Descending Triangles/Rising wedges.) as we enter the next next week. Current Positions- BA $120p May 15th, LYV $25p May 15 Put, AMD $45p June, &amp; NVDA $200p June 2020 Put",

The DJIA went from +937 to close 1,000 lower @-26.13 (.12%), NASDAQ -25.98 (.33%), S&amp;P 500 -4.27 (.19%), the Russell +.39 (.03%) and the DJ Transports +27.80 (.35%).  Market internals were about as you would expect for an unchanged day with NYSE A/D 2.3:1 and NASDAQ 1.3:1 with an increase in volume.  DJIA was 15:15 with NO triple-digit gains or losses and the leader, GS +53 DP\u2019s with the losers BA -49, PG -34, and WMT -27 DP\u2019s.  The strongest groups Energy (although the oil fell 7%, Financials, real estate, materials and industrials.  Consumer staples and health care were weak.  The early strength was from the possible leveling off of the virus cases and the momentum from yesterday.  The large cap technology names were weak from the start, but it\u2019s awfully hard to top the day AAPL had yesterday +21.00 (8.72%).  But the group gave up whatever gains it had by late afternoon with the only gainers being TSLA, FB, and AMZN (up only .40%).  The interesting thing today was the fact that the US$ was weak (-.8%) but both Oil and Gold were also lower.

Inovio (INO) rallied up to $9.20 but fell back to 7.93 before closing $8.27 -.17 (2.01%), CODX, +2.11 or 26% yesterday also gave back half of it\u2019s gain to close $9.09 -1.22 (11.83%).\n \nIt was only a matter of time before someone would find a \u201cventilator\u201d manufacturer, but today, DPW Holdings, manufacturer of its Coolisys Power Electronics division received a major order last week and today announced that it had increased its offshore manufacturing capacity and that a customer was increasing an order.  The stock was up 85% last week and today it traded up to $1.95 before finishing the day $1.54 +.74 for a 92.50% gain.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was LOWER with BIIB -10.18, ABBV -.58, REGN -2.76, ISRG -12.24, MYL+ .64, TEVA +.20, VRTX -8.30, BHC +.58, INCY +1.55, ICPT +.65, LABU -1.47, and IBB $109.63 -2.08 (1.86%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.44, CGC +.21, CRON -.17, GWPH + 5.17 (5.97%), ACB +.01, PYX -.34, NBEV -.06, CURLF +.08, KERN +.10 and MJ $11.00 +.04 (.36%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was LOWER with LMT -10.45, RTX +.68, GD -.04, TXT -.72, NOC -6.93, BWXT -.83, TDY +6.73, and ITA $147.40 +.54 (.37%).\n \n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.27, JWN +1.94, KSS +3.07, DDS +1.87, JCP +.01, WMT -2.98, TGT +.64, TJX +.34, RL +5.19 (7.57%), UAA +.53, LULU +.05, TPR +1.43, CPRI +2.16 and XRT $31.00 +.79 (2.62%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL +.81, AMZN +12.41, AAPL -2.47, FB +4.20, NFLX -6.51, NVDA -8.40, TSLA +33.63 (6.51%), BABA -2.95, BIDU -2.45, BA -4.28, CAT +4.35, DIS +.42 and XLK $82.95 -.75 (.90%).\n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS the leader +9.73(6.15%), JPM +1.53, BAC +.83, MS +.23, C +.52, PNC -1.24, TRV +1.35, AXP +4.13 (4.92%) and XLF $21.25 +.21 (1.00%).\n \n \nOIL, $23.63 -2.45.

The stocks did not feel the effects of the price and most were higher.  XOM cut spending and said that their fundamental underpinnings remain strong.  CVX +1.00, XOM +.91, OXY +.61, NBL +.11, MRO +.14, MPC -.19, RIG +.08, APA +.71, BP -.05 and XLE $32.08 +.67 (2.13%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,683.70 -10.20. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1742 before falling back to close $60 off the highs and below $1700.  I would be a buyer a bit lower than today\u2019s close.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,330 unchanged. After we traded in a short-range day followed by a $1,000 range on Friday BTC closed above $7,000 for the first time since it broke to the downside early last month.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.67 -.28 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

I have about $300k in savings and will probably use about a 1/3 to 2/3 of it to buy stocks.  I've done a ton of reading the past month and have a list made up but I can't make up my mind which to choose to narrow it down to maybe 3-10 stocks.  Would appreciate your views on these stocks:\n\nVOO, TSLA, ILMN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, SQ, ADBE, FB, BRK.B, RTX, V, SYY, MCD, SBUX, T, DIS, JPM.\n\nThank you.",

        "selftext": "So on one hand we have many tech/cloud names ripping higher (SHOP, AMZN, MSFT, OKTA, TTD, AMD, NVDA to name a few), yet on the other hand we have stocks from most industries in the doldrums and pricing in a severe recession (autos, airlines, mortgage companies, hotels, machinery, builders, energy, media).\n\nIs it not a fallacy in logic to assume that tech stocks can do fantastically well in a future economic landscape where hotels are empty, planes are not flying, new homes aren't being built, cars aren't being bought, etc???  If those tech stocks are going to do so well, or are so relatively \"safe\", then by default, those other industries must be safer than they are currently being perceived as well, no?",

        "selftext": "Good morning, here's my watch list, \n\nGap Ups: ALV, BYND, EW, MESO, PSTI, ROKU, THMO, WWE, ZM\n\nGap Downs: INTC (gapping into 200 DMA), NVDA\n\nPossible Day 2 plays: ZGNX, RCL (day 2 means it moved yesterday and could possibly move again today)\n\nLooks like another flat pre market. Market has been a bit choppy the past few days and the range tightens on SPY as it tries to get over the 50 day moving average. I will be focusing primarily on earnings related plays and as always only entering trades with defined risk:reward calculated before hand. If you don't see any good patterns/trends, then don't trade until you do. The goal is not to make many low quality trades but only trades that have a high probability of working. Trade the best or lose with the rest. Remember it's Friday so be careful out there, no one likes to lose on a Friday. Good luck trading.\n\nI am not holding positions in any of these stocks at the time of this posting.

        "selftext": "Hi guys,   \n\n\nNew Stock investor here, I have been thinking about going into the stock market since the big dip of feb 27, but I didn't know anything about stocks, and I am not US citizen so the process was much more complicated for me, now I am ready to go in, I have 9k USD available to invest and 4k more within 3 weeks (I will still have about 20k USD in saving don't worry).   \n\n\nI know dollar cost average is the way to go and I am planning to do that anyway, but since the market already regained a lot of the loss since the big dip I feel like a lot of the stocks are now overvalued as well, so I am not sure which stock should I start to buy first and which to hold off on, the more I read the more complicated everything seems to get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want my portfolio to consist of blue chip stocks with a lot of room for growth or with steady and increasing dividends, I am ok with the volatility in the short term but I want big gains long term (I will continue investing after the virus is gone), here is the list of stocks that is on my watch list that I thought match my criteria (most of them increased in double digits since I added them on the list so I am no sure anymore),    \n\n\nDIS (Disney) (I know that the parks are closed and their Cruz ships are not operating, but I feel like that will quickly be fixed with vaccine/cure)\n\nMSFT (Microsoft) (Pretty safe and have been growing for the past few years)\n\nQcom (Qualcomm) (it has a lot of ups and downs, but will likely have great revenue from 5G and Autopilot chips). \n\nV (Visa) (Pretty safe and have been growing for the past few years and I think will gain more internationally when people deal more with credit card instead of dirty cash)\n\nMA (MasterCard) (same as visa)\n\nHD (The Home Depot) (Good dividend, increases often, stock price is usually going up, dominant in its market).  \n\nNvidia nvda (still not sure about it, only here because it is dominant in its market).  \n\nShopify (great growth company and I feel they will continue to grow with more people buying online). \n\njnj (possible vaccine, still good company even without one). \n\npep (recession proof, more than just drinks). \n\nsq sqaure ((still not sure about it, only here because they will continue to grow with more people buying online). \n\nfb (growth company as people not really having a negative outlook on it with privacy issues any more)\n\nsbux (I feel like they will come back strong once everything is opened up again). \n\nwalmart (same as sbux).  \n\n\nI know it will be easier to invest in index fund, but I want to go the individual stocks route to increase gains since I will invest a lot of time in the near future to learn everything I can.   \n\n\nAny and all help is appreciated.",

One of the first 5G networks that has just started up. As the pandemic comes to a close, this could gain tractions.\n\n\\* $Shop; Very high price but will later grow as the music industry grows bigger. (long term)\n\n\\* V (visa): 160.53. Slowly declining; My go up when they add a new bitcoin transaction later in the year\n\n\\*SBUX: Slowly falling (3.45%) (4/21/2020): Falling but will most likely rise during summer months and they've started to debut Beyond meat in china and will most likely move to the US market soon. Profiting off Vegans (Probably should wait for new buying point)\n\n\\*\\* ATVI: Watch very closely; Blizzard has some great sellers that are obtaining sequels that might make $$$; They took hits during the \u201cFree Hong Kong Movement; Sometimes drop to around 55$\n\n\\*\\*\\* LUV: Declining; Airline company, $31.06 and usually goes for $60-$70\n\n\\* JPM: Declining to 89.05 and will supposedly spike to the hundred quickly as soon as the pandemic is over. (Going through a lawsuit)\n\n\\*\\*\\* BEP: Brookfield Renewable Partners LP: Going down slowly; Could gain traction quickly after pandemic. Will Bloom when fossil fuel companies eventually die off\n\n\\*\\*\\* NVDA: Declining quickly (6.11%); Future of computer; could be very profitable; great new releases coming later 2020 and 2021\n\nI would also like to ask how to research things for the stock market and what in particular should i research\n\nHow do i get into the Stock Market to begin with\n\nIs it better to go long term or short term\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for any spelling errors, as i had to rush this.

My picks would be\n\nMicrosoft\nVisa\nDisney\nCoca Cola\nMondelez (or Nestle?)\nNvidia\nSpotify\nApple\nFLIR Thermo\n\n\nand some estonian ones like Tallink Grupp (cruise and cargo company, even if doing bad now, will 100% be bailed out by the government) and COOP Pank (fast growing new bank here).\n\nI feel like this is the amount of stocks I could realistically keep an eye on (and make changes as needed).\n\nMy main concern is that I'm playing too safe and won't see any significant returns, what would you add to that list as a more risky stock? What stocks would you throw out right away?\n\nSo, long story short - how screwed do you think I am in let's say... 25 years?\n\n(I know that there are tens of beginner posts out here right now, but I'm just here to learn and get an opinion through another pair of eyes, who knows, maybe that will be useful some way \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)",

Most of the time big gaps fade at open before pushing higher, the last few gaps have held though. Looks like this is buying before earnings which will happen next week. Only take trades with defined reward to risk. Always have an exit planned before entering trades in case price moves against you as well as targets to lock in some gains. Good luck trading",

        "selftext": "For Trading April 3rd\n \nOil Recovery\n \nTrading the Range\n \nJobless Claims Double\n \n \nToday was pretty constructive in that we opened lower with the futures and of course the blockbuster news of Mr. Trumps tweet (which I find not believable) about and Oil deal between Russia and the Saudi\u2019s, that sent us up to the high of the day +534, before we has some sideways action until around 1:15 when we started to sell-off and headed back to down on the day to -90 before we rallied and finished +469.93 (2.24%), NASDAQ +126.73 (1.72%), S&amp;P 500 +56.40 (2.28%), the Russell +13.81 (1.29%) and the DJ Transports +93.13 (1.27%).  There was plenty of news to start the day with Initial Jobless claims that were double the prior number at an astounding 6.6million.  Unfortunately, the number next month will be higher.  Tomorrow, we have the monthly employment number for March as well as the ISM non-manufacturing pre-open.  I regarded today\u2019s market action as very constructive.  The lower open and then rally and a second round-trip to a close near the highs was impressive.  While there is still plenty of work to be done, plenty of bad news on the economy and COVID-19 to come, we seem to be building some underlying support.  Market internals were positive but unimpressive with gains outnumbering losers by 1.4:1 on both NYSE and NASDAQ.  Volume was also lower that I would have liked to have seen.  On the DJIA there were 25 gainers to 5 losers with BA -50, UTX -36, and WBA-18DPs, while the gainers were led by CVX +50, PG and CAT +36 and MMM+32 DPs.  \n \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 800 members.\n \n \nSECTORS: Walgreen reported earnings today and although they had better than expected numbers, they gave less than stellar guidance and the stock fell to a lower low than the March bottom and made a new low close since 2013.  WBA fell to $39.41 and closed $40.32 -2.71 (6.3%).  We used the decline to buy some CVS calls, which has been consolidating and has outperformed its competitor.  Shopify suspended its guidance and the stock, another darling that was priced for perfection got slammed.  The stock, up from $20 in 2016 topped out over $593 in February had fallen to 303 last month but climbed back to $470 last week fell to $334.55 before closing 346.30 -38.37 (9.97%).\n \nAnd last, the Disaster Du Jour was Luckin Coffee (LK), the Chinese Starbucks, sort of.  The stock spent 7 months between $15 and $25 before taking off on a run from $18 to over $50 late last year.  It fell back to $28 but had traded up to $43 last month before starting down and closing just above $26 yesterday.  Unfortunately, the COO was found to have basically fabricated all of the results since Q2.  Muddy Waters wrote up the company on 1/31 saying it had \u201cevolved into a fraud.\u201d\nThe stock gapped down to open $4.92, rallied back to $10.58 buy gave up the gains and finished $6.40 -19.80 (75.57%).  Clearly a disaster on any day.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +11.20, ABBV +1.08, REGN +1.35, ISRG +8.74, MYL -.23, TEVA -.35, VRTX +16.68 (7.4%), BHC M+.10, INCY +4.32 (5.82%), ICPT +.89, LABU +1.98(10.42%) and IBB $108.69 +4.90 (4.72%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: This group was MIXED with TLRY +.25, CGC +.29, CRON +.14, GWPH -.50, ACB +.04, PYX -.37 (13.26%), NBEV -.04, CURLF +.08, KERN +.04 and MJ $10.77 +.21 (1.99%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +14.98 (4.43%), RTN -3.93, GD +.35, TXT +.07, UTX -5.37 (5.88%), NPOC +7.30, BWXT +2.24, TDY +14.50 (5.23%) and ITA $136.94 +.47 (.34%).\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.01, JWN -.13, KSS -1.12 (8.66%), DDS -2.29 (8.20%), JCP -.02, WMT +4.36 (3.82%), TGT -.97, TJX -.77, RL +.28, UAA -.42 (5.08%), LULU +2.08, TPR +.04, CPRI -.69, and XRT $27.64 -.39 (1.39%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +14.90, AMZN +8.80, AAPL +2.99, FB -1.80, NFLX +3.92, NVDA +11.06, IBM +4.31, TSLA +53.44, BABA +.89, BIDU +1.12, BA -6.32, CAT +5.06, DIS +1.18 and XLK $78.33 +1.79 (2.34%).\n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +5.21, JPM +3.02, BAC +.68, MS +2.14, C +.50, PNC +3.38, AIG -.20, TRV +3.79, AXP -1.14, and XLF $20.04 +.49 (2.51%).\n \n \nOIL, $25.32 +5.01. The explosive move in Oil today was spurred on by an early morning tweet from Mr. Trump claiming that Russia and the Saudi\u2019s were close to an agreement.  My first thought was BS, but the market held and finished strong.  My only warning is that we have had several of these spikes that have failed with news that we knew was real.  The stocks were stronger across the board with CVX the big winner +7.56 (11.03%) and added 50 DPs.  XOM +3.12 (8.13%), OXY +2.05 (19%), OAS +.06, NBL +.47 (8%), MRO +.33, MPC +.58, RIG +.02, APA +.68 (16.92%), BP +1.80 (7.38%) and XLE $30.15 +2.53 (9.16%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,637.70 +46.30. After the recent gains, Gold has failed to break through the highs around $1700 and have fallen back.  Today\u2019s rebound is of little technical value.  I will reassess and look for a new entry point.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $6,865 +655. After we traded in another short-range day yesterday we had a range of over $1000 today, closing about midrange. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.72 +1.22 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "For Trading April 2nd\n \nBack to the Doldrums!\n \nAll Day Selloff\n \nBanks and Retail Hard Hit\n \n \nToday was another day the carryover from yesterday never gave it a chance to recover.  News was not good really anywhere, but none much worse than what CCL had to pay in the marketplace to raise $4billion.  I\u2019m assuming that they are using their ships as collateral and it still cost 12%.  From my perspective that is an almost unheard-of number for such an asset rich company, and the stock showed it finishing $8.80 4.37 (33%).  There were also a couple of smaller oil deals that chaptered today, leading to the expectation that more will be on the way.  All 11 S&amp;P sectors were lower with the surprise being that the leaders on the downside were the normally \u201csafe\u201d groups like Utilities -7.7%, real estate -7.4% and banking -6.4%.  There was clearly a \u201cflight to safety with the bonds strong all day and the 10-year falling below .60% and the 5-yr notes .375%.  One surprise was a late day rally in the Oil which had briefly broken the $20 level only to rally back and head toward $21.55 +1.05.  Market internals were lopsided on NYSE at 13:1 and slightly better on NASDAQ close to 6:1.\n \nVolume picked up a bit but at the end of the day it was roughly 9:1 negative.  Also not helping matters was Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the fact that were we going to have to weather the next two weeks of \u201cvery painful\u201d statistics in terms of fatalities.  He is meeting with CEOs of major Oil companies on Friday, if they\u2019re not smart enough to travel to Washington.  XRX is also withdrawing its offer for HP, Marriott (MAR $69.15 -5.66 (7.6%) confessed to yet another security breach affecting 5.2 million customers and Macy\u2019s (M) is being dropped from the S&amp;P 500 index.\n \nThe final numbers were DJIA -973.65 (4.44%), NASDAQ -339.62 (4.41%), S&amp;P500 -114.09 (4.41%), the Russell -81.11 (7.03%) and the DJ Transports -379.74 (4.91%).  The DJIA was 29 down and WMT the only gainer.

        "selftext": "I will preface this summary by stating that I as an investor am exceptionally bearish. It has become clear to me that although the Fed is doing its best to support the economy and continue the upward trend, there is much to consider for the bear market case.\n\nThat said, I would like to outline what I feel are the best purchases available for the near future, including discussions of P/E, Cash on hand, sustainability and forward viability.\n\n\nAlthough many companies have taken a massive hit over the past month, some continue to succeed, even by bear market standards. For example, the tech industry is particularly well suited to beat the overarching bear market sentiment. Most tech companies have lots of capital on hand to withstand the downturn, case in point: \n\n\n**TECH**\n\n\nThe following companies posted the following relevant statistics:\n(All P/E given in 2019 numbers)\n\nApple: \nCash on hand: 207B \n-- CFRA 12 month target $320\n-- Current share price: $260\n\n\nMSFT: \nCash on hand: 136B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $197\n-- Current share price: $164\n\n\nAlphabet: \nCash on hand: 117B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $1761\n-- Current share price: $1187\n\n\nAmazon: \nCash on hand: 44B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $2400\n-- Current share price: $2100.59\n\n\nIntel: \nCash on hand: 13.4B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $70\n-- Current share price: $58.38\n\n\nDell: \nCash on hand: 8.15B \n-- Morningstar fair market value: $65\n-- Current share price: $38.37\n\n\nAMD: \nCash on hand: 1.5B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $53\n-- Current share price: $47.54\n**Increasing market share vs Intel and Nvidia\n\n\nNvidia: \nCash on hand: 1.08B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $300\n-- Current share price: $258.95\n\n\nSupplier for 7nm tech:\n\n\nTSM: \nCash on hand: 594M \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $63\n-- Current share price: $49.73\n\n\nSamsung: Private\n\n\n**Chinese semiconductor suppliers that have unverified credentials\n\n\n**OIL**\n\nAlthough the situation with oil is currently incredibly volatile pending deals between the KSA, Russia and the United States, I felt given the recent demise of West Texas Intermediate futures prices of over 50%, it would be prudent to note the companies most likely to weather the storm, as well as potential benefactors given debt status and income level.\n\n\nExxon Mobil:\nCash on hand: 6.6B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $41\n-- Current share price: $41.23\n-- P/E - 24.9 - 19.7\n\n\nChevron:\nCash on hand: 7M\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $98\n-- Current share price: $80.90\n-- P/E - 82.7 - 69.5\n\n\nOccidental Petroleum: \nCash on hand: Approx 1B\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $13\n-- Current share price: $13.83\n-- P/E - 16.4 - 10.5 (2018)\n**It should be noted OXY has an estimated 6.3B in debt due in 2021, but is saving 4.3B in cash for dues. OXY is cash flow negative for oil production at this time.\n\n\nDevon Energy Corporation:\nCash on hand: 32M\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $23\n-- Current share price: $8.70\n-- P/E - 44.3 - 19.4 (2018)\n\n\n**Hospitality**\n\nCarnival Cruise Lines:\nCash on hand: 7M\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $43\n-- Current share price: $11.27\n-- P/E - 14.2 - 9.2 \n**CCL recently took a 10% purchase from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia valued at more than 300M\n\n\nRoyal Carribean Cruises LTD:\nCash on hand: 6.6B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $100\n-- Current share price: $33.56\n-- P/E - 15.0 - 10.3\n\n\nHilton Worldwide Holdings:\nCash on hand: 3.3B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $120\n-- Current share price: $65.93\n-- P/E - 37.1 - 22.1\n\n\nMGM Resorts Intl:\nCash on hand: 2.04B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $30\n-- Current share price: $13.63\n-- P/E - 8.7 - 6.1\n\n\nLas Vegas Sands:\nCash on hand: 2.29B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $62\n-- Current share price: $42.67\n-- P/E - 20.1 - 14.5\n\n\n\n**My Personal Purchases**\n\nI will be purchasing/have purchased the following stocks at what I will include as a good price (to me):\n\nAMD: $43\nMSFT: $140\nNVDA: $240\nXOM: $40\nOXY: $10\nMGM: $11\nHLT: $45\nCCL: $9\nDIS: $90\n\n\nI will add that as holding a bearish outlook, I do not feel we are near the bottom. I plan to make increasingly aggressive purchases on what I feel will be a leg down to 2000 S&amp;P. That said, I am still committing around 1-2% of my available cash for purchasing stock I feel is decidedly undervalued but likely to survive/succeed.\n\nIf there are any questions, feel free to provide them. I will also accept request for statistics on companies I feel would be a good value. The choices for these companies' inclusion is my personal opinion and I am not a financial advisor.",

SPY nearest resistance around 290. Big tech had a good day yesterday and the qqq broke over the 200 DMA and is now gapping into the 50 DMA, well have to see if this fades off at the open or pushes higher. Most of the time big gaps fade at open before pushing higher, the last few gaps have held though. Looks like this is buying before earnings which will happen next week. Only take trades with defined reward to risk. Always have an exit planned before entering trades in case price moves against you as well as targets to lock in some gains. Good luck trading",

Launch of D+ has been okay so far but Netflix is still the king of streaming.\n\nNvidia - Riskier stock but has a lot of potential with popular and strong products. Expensive though. \n\nFortinet - Key provider of cyber security and this area is only going to get more needed with all this tech. Again riskier though.\n\nAMD - Hear a lot about this possibly promising stock but is it all speculation?

        "selftext": "Stating the obvious here, but I'm bullish on the video game market.  I think they're here to stay, they're not just going to be a short-term thing with COVID.  My take on video games is that they have a very addictive nature, people get hooked on them.  With kids having been at home and doing \"virtual learning,\" they're playing video games more - I read a report recently that said Verizon was experiencing an increase of 75% in video game usage on their network.  I think this continues. There's an interesting gap going on right now in creative content and video games helps fill the void.  \n\nLooking at Microsoft and Sony in particular - not only are they the leaders in the space (I believe?), but I like the diversity of their businesses as well.  Not just their gaming segments, but the semiconductor, music, pictures, etc. parts.  Their conglomerate structures somewhat hides the value of these separate underlying businesses.  \n\nAlso looking at some pure-play semi-conductors that would be influential in the supply chain - like AMD and Nvidia.  \n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "In my opinion, Nvidia will be greatly impacted by COVID-19 due to following reasons:\n\n1. Slowdown in gaming market in GPU. Yes, people are playing more games, but it is less likely those gamers will purchase new gaming hardware, including GPU. This will validated by Asustek reporting 30% fall in sales of GPU.\n2. Slowdown in AI market. As technology startup dwindles and expected fall in Information Technology budget, Nvidia will sell less GPUs to data centers.

        "selftext": "\n \n \nOIL Rebounds!\n \nStocks Rally\n \nSeveral Solid Earnings Surprises\n \n \nAs I said in my closing comment (below) there were 3 legs to the stool that supported the market today, oil, earnings, and strong futures.  The market in the oil was up a little, down a little, but when the futures rallied off the $10.00 level and moved to as high as $16.18, the turn in the market was right there following it.  We finished with the DJIA +456.94 (1.99%), NASDAQ +232.15 (2.81%), S&amp;P 500 +62.75 (2.29%), the Russell +16.43 (1.39%) and the DJ Transports (the only loser -3.78 (.05%).  There were only 3 DJIA names lower and only single digits with the gainers MCD +61, AAPL +53, V +40, MSFT +39, and INTC and HD adding 25 DPs.\nVolume was a little light with A/D 2.5:1 on NYSE and 2.2:1 on NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) was the strongest mover with energy number 2.  Consumer staples and financials were weak.  \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/YOGWiIDX-sM\n \nSECTORS: Earnings were a feature again with SNAP continuing higher after last night\u2019s numbers and finishing $17.01 +4.57 (37%).  TXN finished +5.14 (4.8%), and the biggest winner was CMG +95.57 (12.2%) on an earnings beat and a monster gain in digital business.\n \nExpedia (EXPE) is being courted by 2 private equity firms for a $1 Billion investment.  The stock is down from $144 last year to hit $40.76 in March but finished the day $61.42 +4.17 after trading as high as $64.12.  I\u2019m sure that these two firms are much smarter than I, but I can\u2019t see the upside for a very long time.  When restaurants reopen, capacity will be cut, same for hotels and cruise ships.  I have no idea how long planes will be required to fly with smaller loads, but there are just too many \u201cunknowns\u201d to plunk $1 billion down for hospitalities.  Just saying.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with the big exception being BIIB.  It finished \u2013 31.51 (9.58%) on the news that its Alzheimer\u2019s drug will be delayed.

From there we had a rally that kept us between -60 and +100 for the next 4 hours finishing -32.23 (.13%), NASDAQ -122.43 (1.4%), S&amp;P 500 -16.09 (.52%), the Russell +16.20 (1.26%) and the DJ Transports +89.90 (1.08%).  Bottom line here is that we had really split market with NASDAQ and Russell at opposite ends of the spectrum.  Consumer confidence fell hard to 86.9 vs 92 expected and Richmond Fed was -53 vs. +2 expected.  Market internals were mixed too, with NYSE 2.5:1 Up while the NAZ was only 9:7 higher.  Volume remained light.  The DJIA was 17 up, 13 down with the leaders MMM +28, GS +24, AXP +21, and DD and BA +18 DPs.  On the downside we had UNH -41, AAPL -31, MSFT -29 and JNJ -19 DPs.

I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.

The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/NSO2vQcSY-o\n \nSECTORS: Earnings played a big part in today\u2019s market.  PEP last night with a beat and was +1.86, CINF was a miss last night and gapped down this morning to 76.28 and just continued to fall to $71.27 before closing $71.81 -10.22 (12.46%).  On the upside we had HOG with a \u201cnot as bad as expected +2.88 (15.21%), ADS $47.60 +6.21 (15%), and ALK $31.58 +3.73 (13.39%).\n \nAfter the close we heard from Google and it was a beat on revenues and after closing $1232.59 -38.27 and after trading $1206.97, turned back higher and after hitting $1290 is currently $1267 +35.  SBUX was a slight miss and after closing 78.69 is now 77.60 -1.10.  AMD missed on expected revenue growth and after its recent move back from a recent low of $36.75 to over $58, fell to $52.40 and is $53.21 -2.29 (4.13%).\n \nAnd, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY is clearly Creative Realities (CREX), a small firm with a stock that closed $1.00 yesterday +22%, came out of the gate this morning unchanged and rallied on the news that it has a \u201cnon-contact temperature system\u201d that along with its AI enabled software \u201caddresses the urgent need for businesses and employers to build consumer confidence as the world goes back to work as stay at home orders are reduced throughout the U.S.\u201d  The stock traded as high as $5.15 and is currently 4.85 +3.85 or 385%...Clearly a home run.\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was HIGHER with TSN +2.51, BGS +1.50, FLO +.06, CAG +.05, MDLZ -.73, KHC +.25, CALM +.21, JJSF +1.92, SAFM +.35 and LANC +1.52.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was LOWER with BIIB +1.98, ABBV -1.64, REGN -18.91, ISRG -13.65, GILD -1.51, MYL +.30, TEVA +.17, VRTX -11.55 (4.3%), BHC -.41, INCY -5.31 (5.16%), ICPT -4.10, LABU -2.89 and IBB $124.86 -2.67 (2.09%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was LOWER with TLRY -.30, CGC -.53, CRON -.18, GWPH -1.67, ACB -.016, PYX -.14, NBEV -.04, CURLF -.28, KERN +.05 and MJ $12.40 +.02 (.16%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +8.23, RTX +.71, GD +2.74, TXT +.86, NOC +2.19, BWXT +.33, TDY +5.96 and ITA N$163.94 +2.88 (1.91%).\n  \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.51, JWN +.21, KSS +1.26, DDS +3.21 (11.35%), JCP +.026, WMT -.28, TGT +2.23, TJX +1.86, RL +3.61, UAA +.36, LULU -1.82, TPR +1.06, CPRI +1.18 and XRT $36.97 +.61 (1.68%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL the big exception on earning +74.34 (5.85%), AMZN -21.00, AAPL -2.48, FB +2.71, NFLX -15.68, NVDA -1.34, TSLA -22.25, BABA -1.69, BIDU -2.56, CMG -13.07, BA +2.22, CAT +.31, DIS +.60, and XLK $88.85 -.54 (.60%).\n \n  \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +3.57, JPM +1.03, BAC +.53, MS +.95, C +.89, PNC +.50, AIG +1.38, TRV +1.40, AXP +3.15, V +.74 and XLF $22.75 +.27 (1.2%).\n \n \nOIL, $112.34 -.44. Oil was a BIG STORY another day of liquidation that took June all the way down to trade $10.07 before turning back higher to 13.69 before closing -.44. Tonight, it is higher again trading 13.05 +.71.  The stocks were also higher with gains of about 2% and XLE closed $36.22 +.85 (2.4%).\n \n  \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,724.40 + .60. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We have spent the last 3 days consolidating the gains and hit $1,720 today.  I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 today, I was a buyer.  We are also long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,780 unchanged. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was a continuing move higher.

        "selftext": "I see all these well-written and very long posts arguing for why like SPY can go to like 170 or 180 or some value like 200 or lower.\n\nHere's the thing people need to understand. Stop looking at just the virus and it's economic impact and then putting some arbitrary number on where you think SPY can go. The only way we can get to say a value of like 180 is forced selling. That's the only way. That's actually how we even got to 220 in the first place on that very sharp drop.\n\nAs long as people are not forced to sell, you can forget 180. It cannot get to 180 on regular market dynamics. Even with forced selling, it needs to be like a catastropic amount of correlated forced selling (from short vol blowupts to Treasury blowups) to get to that level.\n\nThe forced selling would also have to come from the tech names that have not been hit as hard. AMZN, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, NFLX are all UP for the year. Sure, they'll go down if SPY drops, but for SPY to get to 180, these stocks would need to really crash. Do you really think MSFT is going to crash to 100? Think about it this way. You know anyone who owns MSFT right now and is even passively selling it? Now, not only do you need the passive sellers to sell, but you need the forced sellers to sell on top? Very, very unlikely that's happening in MSFT.\n\nYou may ask how does forced selling occur? I can explain that more in detail, but it's way too technical here (it's related to a bunch of assets, but option gamma, short VIX, credit, and bonds are the main ones). I'm just here saying that's an event that is not very probable right now, so don't expect SPY 180 to happen. SPY 220? That's more possible, not sure if we reach it again or not (we already reached it once), but SPY 180 or even 200 is way lower chance than what most of these posts I've read on Reddit are implying. It's a way lower chance, like maybe 5% of what the Reddit posts imply.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to say some (insert a bunch of fundamentals like unemployment, deaths, etc.) -&gt; means this value in SPY.  The market is driven by buyers/sellers at the end of the day.  This is what people forget.  Buyers/sellers are correlated to news, but it's not a 100% correlation.  At the end of the day, you need a ton more sellers than buyers for SPY to go to 180.  You won't ever get that unless there's forced selling, and it needs to be really dramatic forced selling that is far beyond March.",

        "selftext": "Over the long run which will result in bigger gains. From all the backtests I've done it seems buy and hold would come out to more. But, with buy and hold it also seems you miss profit chances when available and you could be caught holding the bag if the company falters and underperforms for years, and with trading you take advantage of market crashes and you don't tie up your money as well. However, it is hard to time the market, you have short term taxes, and a lot of studies have proven that buy and hold performs better. The only thing that gets me is it is painful seeing your stocks going down while others go up at times with a buy and hold approach.\n\nWhat do you all think is better between the two. And is worth holding a stock that dips for the long term gain, or would it have been better to sell while ahead. For example, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Nvidia and a lot of tech stocks have had huge up and down swings of 30% or more would it have been better to sell with say a 10% gain(because it would be really hard to perfectly time that 30% gain exactly), or would it be better to deal with the losses as they come and keep what you have or average down and never sell the stock until retirement?",

It didn\u2019t take long for those two to reverse and head lower.  This market cares absolutely nothing for the reality of the current situation.  We have a president who thinks he\u2019s a king and will do whatever he wants, whenever he wants and will reopen the economy on command.  His base may believe that, but it is 180 degrees opposite of what the science says.  The DJIA finished +558.99 (2.39%), NASDAQ +323.32 (3.96%), S&amp;P 500 +84.43 (3.06%), the Russell +25.29 (2.09%) and the DJ Transports +140.77 (1.75%, again a laggard).  The DJIA was 24:6 Up on the day with AAPL the big gainer +94 DPs, followed by HD +59, MSFT +56, UNH +47, and JNJ as standout who provided forward guidance and went against the trend and raised their dividend.  BA was the big loser on news that it had 150 orders 737MAX cancelled and fell 43 DPs with JPM and AXP also losers.  BTW, just an aside, there were 21 splits listed for the balance of April, ALL OF THE REVERSES.  These included several of the leveraged ETF names but also included Chesapeake Energy (CHK) with a 1:200 in order to stay on the NYSE.  Market internals were about average with NYSE A/D 3:1 and NADSAQ 2.4:1.  Volume was a touch below average.  Consumer discretionary and information tech were strong with financials and energy weak.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video (new equipment)  https://youtu.be/vK9cZB5oYu0\nSECTORS: The FAANG names were strong across the board (see below) and bonds were mostly unchanged to a touch lower.  On the small cap biopharma group, which has a new name popping up every day we had Sonnet Bio (SONN) another one of those wonderful reverses (1:10 and 1:26) trading $10.80 +5.86 preopen and followed by a run to $16.20 before finishing the day $7.99 +3.05 (61.74%) with no news except \u201ctrading halted, trading resumed.  MEI Pharma (MEIP) had good news in the receipt of $100MM payment and for its oral, once a day drug for \u201cB-cell malignancies.\u201d  I may be entitled to up to $582MM based on successful development.  The stock traded 2.91 +1.24 (74.8%) preopen and continued to open $3.05, trade up to $3.64 but selloff a bit to close $2.50 +.83 (49.7%).  Last in this group, RedHill Biopharma (RDHL) updated its progress with its drug, Opaganib, approved for compassionate use in Italy and Israel.  The COVID-19 treatment has been very successful.  In Israel, the treatment of just 2 patients demonstrated \u201cmeasurable clinical improvement within days of treatment initiation.\u201d  Patients needed decreased oxygen requirements, decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and increased lymphocyte levels.  One patient was treated in the ICU, considered for intubation and was released within days of treatment.  Although it traded as high as $22.22 in late 2015, it has not been reversed, it traded as low as $3.26 in March and worked its way higher and broke to the upside Monday 4/6 over $5.50 and has continued higher.  It closed today $7.51 +.63 (9.16%) after hitting $8.24.  So, not a one-day wonder, it has moved from $3.26 to $7.51 over the last 2 weeks.\n \nLast was ROKU reporting a big gain in revenues this morning.  This Lotto tick from $15 in 2017 to trade $176.55 in (9/19) fell back to $58.22 in March finishing the day $106.53 +9.97 (10.33%), almost doubling in just under a month.  \n\nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +10.82, ABBV +2.88, REGN +7.82, ISRG +20.46 (4.14%), MYL +.29, TEVA +.30, VRTX +12.22 (4.84%), INCY +3.27, ICPT +3.29 LABU +3.10 (11.41%) and IBB $118.55 +4.06 (3.55%).\n\nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.51, CGC +1.02, CRON +.22, GWPH +1.27, ACB - .004, PYX +.16, NBEV +.39, CURLF +.06, KERN +.10 and MJ $11.70 +.25 (2.18%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +15.04, RTX +3.91, GD +1.90, TXT +.06, NOC +9.94, BWXT +.65, TDY +6.27, and ITA $154.67 +4.04 (2.68%).\n  \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.02, JWN -.39, KSS +.24, DDS -1.16, JCP -.01, WMT +3.79, TGT +3.70, TJX +2.37, RL +.53, UAA +.41, LULU +5.93, TPR +.61, CPRI +1.38 (10.58%), and XRT $34.75 +1.47 (4.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with several big moves vs. the overall market, with GOOGL +54.59, AMZN +116.13 (5.35%), AAPL +14.15 (5.18%), FB +3.42, NFLX +15.51, NVDA +14.64 (5.43%), TSLA +61.70 (9.48%), BABA +5.74, BIDU +2.98, BA -6.33, CAT +2.71, DIS +2.60 and XLK $89.10 +3.71 (4.34%).\n  \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -1.73, JPM -2.36, BAC -.14, MS +.29, C -1.53, PNC -1.46, AIG +.15, TRV +3.57, AXP -1.94, and XLF $22.75 +.22 (.98%).\n \nOIL, $20.11 -2.30. Oil was lower overnight and by the NY open this morning the best it could do was $21.92 -39 and started lower until it fell in the late afternoon to trade 19.95 before a small rally to close just over $20.00.  Tonight, it is up $ .75.  Tonight\u2019s closing comment on the front page discusses this situation and the position we took in SCO.  Stocks were lower with the XLE $38.80 unchanged. This is a video update I made midday.  https://youtu.be/40obqKxYVek\n  \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,768.90 +7.50. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 today. Today was a major move to the upside and the close is the highest since September 2012 and sets up a move towards the highs at $1,800 from 2011.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $6950 +140. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we\u2019d have to test 67.50 and today we hit 6550 before turning back up.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.30 +.05 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Good morning, here's my watch list\n\nGap ups: AAPL, ATOS, BABA, CEMI, CGEN, EDNT, MSFT, NVDA, NVO, RCUS, ROKU, TSM,  ZS\n\nGap Downs: MS, RAD, TSLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarket slightly gapping up, still with very few stocks that have catalyst and most stocks are gapping with the market. If the market fades off it's likely that most gap ups will fade with it at open. SPY sitting just under the 50 day moving average which is at 287.74 but still holding above the 272 pivot level from last year so it is a good sign.  Things should start picking up next week as we get into earnings season, until then it's business as usual. Only take solid trades with entry, stops, and targets planned before entering trades. If price goes against you, always have a plan to exit with small losses so you don't get wiped out in 1 trade. Good luck trading",

        "selftext": "Goood morning r\\Investing,\nI am wondering about NVDA and their volatility. They had some very promising runs in the past and I am looking for the long game. A very long run. They acted rather volatile and had a few ups and downs, which might be useful. I am looking to join the party but I am afraid I lost the moment.\nThe market won\u2018t stop that covid-party anytime soon. So there will definitely be some harsh days coming up. \nThey\u2018ve already gone down to 183 but I am wondering if they will fall back again. They for shure didn\u2018t even encounter supply chain issues jet so we might be in for a rough ride. Also their quarterly earnings might hurt, so there will be a few other selloffs. But I am wondering about the right time. Will it be after the next report? Or should I wait some more time for another bump?  What are your price targets for NVDA to get in?\nGreetings and stay safe in those challenging times.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m having a bit of a dilemma choosing between these two stocks. INTC vs TSM.\n\nThey are not direct competitors, but TSMC manufactures chips for Intel\u2019s competitor AMD. They also have big clients like Apple and Nvidia. They also have the edge in terms of manufacturing technology and are already projecting the production of 5 and 3nm chips.\n\nOn the other hand, intel designs and manufactures its chips, and had multiple delays for the 10 and 7nm chips. However with all the means they have they can very well mark a come back and become more attractive in terms of innovation. Plus, I think their stock is \u201csafer\u201d and less cyclical than TSMC.\n\nBoth their balance sheets look healthy to me.\n\nI would love to hear your opinions, and what would be your recommandation between the two stocks.\n\nThank you very much!",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading April 13th\n \n \nStocks Rally, Again\n \nOil Fails on Cutbacks\n \n \nToday was another day in which the market rallied on bad news.  First time unemployment claims were 6.6 million vs the 5 million expectations, a big number by itself.  The FED hit the market with it\u2019s announcement of a new $2.3 TRILLION of emergency lending to businesses and municipalities.  The UK announced its plan to fund their fiscal needs and in Germany, Merkel rejected the Italians demand for a joint euro debt deal.  U. of Michigan Consumer Sentiment fell sharply to 71 vs. 89 in March and the consensus of 79.3.  The DJIA finished +285.80 (1.22%), NASDAQ +62.68 (.77%), S&amp;P 500 +39.84 (1.45%) the Russell again beat all others at +55.06 (4.62%) while the DJ Transports were +84.53 (1.04%).  Market internals were 5.5:1 on NYSE and 3:1 NASDAQ.  Volume was light again, but on a pre-holiday trading day that\u2019s par for the course.  Financials, real estate and Industrials were strong and Health care, technology and communication services weak.  DJIA were 19 up and 11 lower with no triple-digit gainers or losers.  JPM +58, GS +50, HD +49, and MCD +42 DPs, while UNH -22, jnj -14 and INTC -13 DPs.  \nTonight\u2019s Closing Commentary is available https://youtu.be/O7pZP678FZs\n \nThere was also an excellent interview on CNBC HalfTime with Chamath Palihapitiya about bailouts and the American public that I\u2019ve added.  I think it\u2019s especially interesting given that he is not a politician, but rather a venture capitalist.  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/chamath-palihapitiya-us-needs-to-let-hedge-funds-billionaires-fail.html\nBesides this portion of the interview Chamath discusses that if the government wants to help \u201cpeople\u201d and make them even, they should take their last years W2 and pay them monthly what they earned last year and not to support the banks by taking illiquid assets off their balance sheets.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.

        "selftext": "Long story short, I took risks on SPCE, LK, AMRN, CGC to go along with mutual funds, AAPL, NVDA, FB and others. I bet big on the AMRN case and lost. It was my second biggest holding to AAPL. LK was around my 5th largest position. So two 70% drops in three trading days. I was up a good portion on all those and not only let my greed take over, I was afraid of the capital gains all at once (I wanted to adjust early in the coronavirus cycle).\n\nMy thoughts now are to wait for a hopefully mini-pop to take out all AMRN, most LK, most SPCE and most CGC. \n\nMy portfolio is now cut in half from my peak in February.

        "selftext": "fellow autists, I know I'm not the only retard tired of losing tendies despite $SPY moving lower. well i was scrolling the sub this morning and got inspired by a post (can't find it, will edit in link if I can later) that basically said stop betting against the SPY, start betting against certain companies that actually make up the SPY (also, stop buying fucking FD's, start buying further out puts that are close to ITM) so I made myself a cup of coffee, watched my girl get fucked by her ex boyfriend and his brother, did a lot of math, looked at a bunch of charts, and now I have *the* company to bet against here.\n\nfirst, lets talk about what happened last week. daddy blew a ~~tweet~~ firework up the oil industry's ass, leading to the biggest one-day increase in oil price history. you know whats happened every single time the oil industry has its biggest one-day increase in oil price? it fucking goes down. every. single. time. -17.21% on average before a bottom was reached. average of 79 calendar days to that bottom. \n\nyou know what also happened? $IWM hit lows that it hasn't seen since 2016. it's down 30.72% since March 5th. $SPY is down 19.78% since March 5th. what's that tell us? small businesses are fucked basically. we knew that already though, right? I mean, it's this subs favorite catch phrase \"it's already priced in you retard\" well in this case, yea, it is. on $IWM. it's not totally priced into SPY. you know what though? the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bcomes for everyone eventually. if $SPX were to hit 2016 lows, it'd be at 2075. that's another -16.62% to fall.\n\nanyone ever heard of the 60/40 balanced portfolio? none of you fucking autists probably have, but that's alright. it's a retirement fund made up of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. who cares, right? well actually, it just dropped 20% of peak value for the fourth time in 75 years. what happened those other three times? glad you asked. an average of -12.16% to the low in an average of 27 calendar days.\n\nwhat does this all tell us? for starters, stop betting for/against $IWM. there's no tendies to be made there. but the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bhere have a point, things are looking grim and we're not close to the bottom yet. the problem is you're all getting theta/IV fucked into oblivion because you just fucking NEED that screenshot now and can't trade anything other than SPY \n\nso what exactly can we do with this information? well instead of hoping jpow's printer finally runs out of some fucking ink, we can seek out a vulnerable company...\n\n1. that is down since 3/5 but not down as much as $SPY \n2. is in a vulnerable industry\n3. trades on good volume\n\nlook no further than $AMD. semiconductors are notoriously one of the first to move when the market flips. unlike it's competitors $NVDA and $INTC, they don't have a cloud-computing business. they sell computer chips (APUs and GPUs). the stock is down -11.47% since 3/5. that trails SPY's fall by 8.31%. it jumped up a bit on 3/24 with just about every other tech stock, but it tumbled 4.27% on Friday. they're set to report earnings around the last week of April but they rarely surprise and don't move much on earnings in general. if we're trailing SPY by \\~8% AND we think there's an additional \\~12% to go, there's a lot of upside in the downside here. since we're trailing SPY by about 8%, let's conservatively say there's only 12% left for AMD to move to the downside (instead of \\~20%) a 12% decrease in the stock price would be \\~$37.50 \n\ntl;dr: the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bcomes for everyone, stop betting against SPY, start betting against AMD. it's going down and you can get right on an ITM strike at a relatively cheap price with good volume and a low-ish (low 60s) IV\n\n$AMD 6/19 42p",

There are many in play so if you don't like any of these, run a scan after the open. The market has printed the \"W\" reversal pattern that we talked about yesterday and is now sitting at the 272 pivot from June of 2019 which should act as resistance however this is a unique situation with the government stimulus/bailout so we will have to see if the market breaks over and can hold that level. Everything is gapping today with the market, yesterday turned out to be a strong day maybe today we see some follow through. Wait for good patterns with defined risk/reward before entering.

        "selftext": "Hey guys! Earnings season is up. I have tried a premium selling strategy that has worked for me pretty well for at least more than an year. The strategy is a simple put credit spread. And you do it on the companies that have a history of beating revenues, companies that have a strong management, etc. Sure, these companies can also take a dip if they miss their estimates but they tend to come back up after sometime. Examples for such companies might be FAANG+Microsoft. To protect my downside, I go out in the 45 DTE monthly, give up some premium collected and go far out to 2X the expected move. It gives me a little more room to the downside and enough time to recoup losses if the trade goes against me. \n\nI have made a list of such companies.

        "selftext": "I see all these well-written and very long posts arguing for why like SPY can go to like 170 or 180 or some value like 200 or lower.\n\nHere's the thing people need to understand.  Stop looking at just the virus and it's economic impact and then putting some arbitrary number on where you think SPY can go.  The only way we can get to say a value of like 180 is forced selling.  That's the only way.  That's actually how we even got to 220 in the first place on that very sharp drop.\n\nAs long as people are not forced to sell, you can forget 180.  It cannot get to 180 on regular market dynamics.  Even with forced selling, it needs to be like a catastropic amount of correlated forced selling (from short vol blowupts to Treasury blowups) to get to this level.\n\nThe forced selling would also have to come from the tech names that have not been hit as hard.  AMZN, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, NFLX are all UP for the year.  Sure, they'll go down if SPY drops, but for SPY to get to 180, these stocks would need to really crash.  Do you really think MSFT is going to crash to 100?  Think about it this way.  You know anyone who owns MSFT right now and is even passively selling it?  Now, not only do you need the passive sellers to sell, but you need the forced sellers to sell on top?  No way that's happening in MSFT\n\nYou may ask how does force selling occur?  I can explain that more in detail, but it's way too technical here.  I'm just here saying that's an event that is not very probable right now, so don't expect SPY 180 to happen.  SPY 220?  That's more possible, not sure if we reach it again or not (we already reached it once), but SPY 180 or even 200 is way lower chance than what most of these posts I've read on Reddit are implying.",

Things should start picking up next week as we get into earnings season, until then it's business as usual. Only take solid trades with entry, stops, and targets planned before entering trades. If price goes against you, always have a plan to exit with small losses so you don't get wiped out in 1 trade. Good luck trading",

        "selftext": "For Trading April 30th\n \n \nOIL Moves Higher\n \nGOOGL, TSLA, &amp; MSFT Blow Away Numbers\n \nRussell the Big Winner\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a dramatic start when already +200 in the futures, GILD came out with positive news on the NIAID trial for Remdesivir and we added an additional 250 to the open.  The Fed FOMC was a nonevent, but after the Q&amp;A, it became obvious that the money train would keep rolling, the Gold moved higher. The final numbers were impressive with DJIA +532.31 (2.21%), NASDAQ +306.98 (3.57%), S&amp;P 500 +76.12 (2.66%), the Russell, the big winner +62.68 (4.83%) and the DJ Transports +221.30 (2.63%).  Market internals were strong with NYSE 7:1 and NASDAQ 4:1 and for the first time in recent memory, volume was higher.  The DJIA was 24:6 with WMT the only double-digit loser -30 DPs while on the upside we had V +72, AAPL +62, AXP &amp; BA +53, and MSFT +52 (and more coming in the morning).\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/el59hhpILHY\n \n \nSECTORS: Earnings played a big part in today\u2019s market.  After the close last night, we heard from Google and it was a beat on revenues and after closing $1232.59 -38.27 and finished the evening $1267 +35.  It continued higher today and finished $1345.02 +112.43 (9.12%).  After today\u2019s close we heard from a few of the other FAANG names.  FaceBook was a miss both top and bottom but the guidance they gave on ad spending was upbeat.  After closing 194.19 +11.28 it to 214.57 + another $20.  MSFT beat on both numbers and after closing $177.43 +7.62 it shot higher to 186.52 before closing $181.25 + 3.82.  TSLA was the last one to report and the stock has been on a tear from a low of $350 in mid-March to close today $800.51 +31.39 and put out a profitable quarter and talked about it big truck.  The stock moved to $886.89 and closed $870.30 for a total gain of $101.88 (13.25%).\n \nAnd, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY is clearly Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR)  reported that it had a 100% survival of its patients treated with CAP-1002.  All were in deep respiratory distress and 5 of the 6 were on ventilators.  Four of the six have already been discharged.  The stock, which has been reversed twice, most recently 1:10, and the last time 1:50 finished the day $8.50 +6.09 (252.7%) Clearly a home run.  But with a side note since the adjusted high after both reverses is $2,720.  Quite a destroyer of equity.\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was LOWER with TSN +.74, BGS -.75, FLO -.47, CAG -.19, MDLZ -.55, KHC +.81, CALM -.79, JJSF +10.71 (8.48%), SAFM -3.43, and LANC +3.09.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB -.46, ABBV +1.20, REGN -17.26 (3.27%), ISRG +16.27 (3.23%), GILD +6.37, MYL +1.06, TEVA +.36, VRTX +1.54, BHC +.95, INCY -1.71, ICPT +1.07, LABU +1.36, and IBB $126.55 +1.74 (1.39%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.18, CGC +.46, CRON +.06, GWPH -.18, ACB +.01, PYX +.03, NBEV +.03, CURLF +.30 (6.67%), KERN -.21 and MJ $12.44 +.18 (1.47%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +8.17, RTX +3.39, GD +.71, TXT +1.48, NOC -12.70, BWXT -.07, TDY +12.71 and ITA $161.85 +7.91 (5.14%).\n \nRETAIL was HIGHER with WMT the big loser again -3.89 (3.04%), M +.26, JWN -.02, KSS +.66, DDS -.45, JCP -.017, TGT +.85, TJX +4.90 (9.98%), RL +2.53, UAA +.19, LULU +7.96, TPPR +1.24 (7.7%), CPRI +1.68 (11.17%), and XRT $37.92 +1.10 (2.99%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +112.43 (9.12%), AMZN +104.12 (4.5%), AAPL +13.72 (4.92%), FB +31.66 (17.31%), NFLX +8.68, NVDA +9.44, TSLA +101.80 (13.25%), BABA +7.15, BIDU +3.12, CMG +26.64, BA +9.65, CAT +5.28, DIS +6.51 (6.13%) and XLK $93.45 +5.25 (5.95%).\n  \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS 5.49, JPM +3.71, BAC +1.31, MS +1.43, C +4.04 (8.56%), PNC +5.00, AIG +2.52 (9.97%), TRV +1.72, AXP +9.16 (10.39%), V +13.74 (8.02%) and XLF $23.38 +.66 (2.9%).\n \nOIL, $15.06 +2.72. Oil was higher again today and seems to be making a decent show of making an important bottom. Tonight, it is higher again trading 15.95 +.89.  The stocks were also much higher with gains of between 6% on the big names and as much as 30% on some of the small ones.  XLE closed $39.95 +3.77 (5.63%).\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,713.40 -8.80. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We have spent the last 3 days consolidating the gains and hit $1,720 today.  I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 yesterday I was a buyer.  We took the downside move this morning and averaged down @ $1.06, and they closed $1.61.  We are also long NEM.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $8825 +1045. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was a continuing move higher.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.60 +1.20 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

With the trope of, '\"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything\", I think it's pretty clear Intel expects earnings to decline later into the year. \n\nThough the coronavirus is definitely a key driver in dampening things, I think the ongoing issues Intel has been facing with respect to losing its process lead due to their difficulty with 10nm, is the more primary concern long term. What used to be an advantage has now largely become a liability as companies like AMD, Nvidia, and Apple have chosen to focus on design while reaping the benefits of TSMC's continuous process improvements effectively for free.\n\nImportant things to look for and potential catalysts I see that are important to Intel's future\n\n1) Intel's ramp up to their 7nm process. With TSMC's 5nm process already in production, they cannot afford to have another failure like their 10nm process was.\n\n2) Proliferation of ARM architecture, primarily looking at any news from companies like Apple making the switch for their laptops to their own in-house processors.",

While the DJIA was +39.44 (.17%), the only other gainer was the Russell +12.54 (1.04%) with NASDAQ -.63 (.01%) and S&amp;P 500 -1.51 (.05%).  The DJ Transports were + 39.44 (.17%), but also near the lows.  Market internals were positive at 1:6:1 on NYSE and 5:3 on NASDAQ.  Volume was in line with the past several days.  Energy, industrials and communication services were strong and consumer staples, real estate and utilities were the weak sisters.  The DJIA was 15 down, 14 up and PG unchanged.  The big losers were MCD -31 and WMT \u2013 21DPs with UNH +55 and BA +20 DPs.  In the news today we had new initial claims for unemployment jumped 810,000 to 4.42 million and new home sales were down 15.4%, and slightly worse than expected.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/mAsxHW461e8\n \n \nSECTORS: Earnings were a feature again with INTC the big name after today\u2019s close and although there was a beat on both top and bottom lines, guidance was a disappointment and the stock, which has rallied off the lows near $44 to close today $59.04 -1.06 fell further to trade $55.26 and is currently $55.95 -3.35 (5.7%).\nEdwards Lifesciences beat and after a move from the recent lows at $155 had closed the day $221.04 +4.52 (2.09%) it bolted higher to trade $238.00 and is currently $230 +8.96, an additional 4%.  Gilead (GILD) was lower after trading $84.00 earlier in the day, and the World Health Org (WHO) mistakenly published a report that the trial in China was ended and the drug, Remdesivir, was a flop.  It immediately fell to -6.2 and was halted at 12:46 for volatility.  After hitting 74.40 it moved back to close $77.78 -3.53 (4.34%).  ZM had a solid day on the news that it had reached 300MM users.  Zoom closed at another new high at $169.09 +18.84 (12.54%).  Last, Google reported after hours that they were slashing their marketing budget by 50% in the 2nd half of the year.  The stock closed $1217.17 +12.76 (1%) but is now $1240 \u201329.85 (2.46%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was MIXED with BIIB -5,76, ABBV +.41, REGN +7.44, ISRG +1.09, GILD (see above), MYL +.39, TEVA +.34, VRTX -1.49, BHC -.04, INCY +.93, ICPT -.14, LABU -.44 and IBB 123.00 -.58 (.47%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was MIXED with TLRY +.02, CGC -.20, CRON +.05, GWPH +.44, ACB -.001, PYX -.14, NBEV -.01, CURLF +.01, KERN +.49, and MJ $11.50 +.06 (.52%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was MIXED with LMT -4.40, RTX -.44, GD -3.37, TXT +1.21, NOC -7.26, BWXT +.62, TDY +3.38 and ITA $149.53 +.50 (.34%).\n \n  \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with the exception of the discounters.  M +.06, JWN +1.13, KSS +.53, DDS +3.14 (13.96%), JCP +.01, WMT -3.38, TGT -3.09, TJX -.65, RL +1.92, UAA +.19, LULU -1.13, TPR +.36, CPRI +.62 and XRT $33.18 -.12 (.36%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -18.40 (see above), AMZN +25.02, AAPL -2.96, FB -.78, NFLX +2.58, NVDA -5.57, TSLA -31.56 (4.31%), BABA -5.26, BIDU -2.54, CMG -20.26, BA +1.21, CAT +1.61, DIS -.48 and XLK $86.10 -1.29 (1.48%).\n \n  \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -2.48, JPM -.36, BAC -.02, MS -.58, C +.04, PNC +.53, AIG +.04, TRV -1.79, AXP -.04, V -1.09, and XLF $21.28 -.24 (1.12%).\n \nOIL, $16.50 +2.72. Oil was the BIGGEST STORY of the day again with the June contract taking over and recovering from what was surely forced liquidation in May.  Remember, that this will happen again unless the market improves before May 19th.  Oil stocks were higher with CVX +1.94, XOM +1.35, OXY +.78, OAS + .56 (197%), NBL +.64, MRO +.33, MPC +.93, RIG +.04, APA +1.23 (13%), BP -.03, HES +2.40 (6.09%) and XLE $34.47 +1.01 (3.02%).\n \n  \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,745.40 +7.10 After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. Tuesday night it fell and hit $1,666 before coming back up $20. Today it rallied again and I still expect much higher prices.  We are long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7540 +425. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we\u2019d have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was impressive.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $8.63 + .93 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Over the long run which will result in bigger gains. From all the backtests I've done it seems buy and hold would come out to more. But, with buy and hold it also seems you miss profit chances when available and you could be caught holding the bag if the company falters and underperforms for years, and with trading you take advantage of market crashes and you don't tie up your money as well. However, it is hard to time the market, you have short term taxes, and a lot of studies have proven that buy and hold performs better. The only thing that gets me is it is painful seeing your stocks going down while others go up at times with a buy and hold approach.\n\nWhat do you all think is better between the two. And is worth holding a stock that dips for the long term gain, or would it have been better to sell while ahead. For example, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Nvidia and a lot of tech stocks have had huge up and down swings of 30% or more would it have been better to sell with say a 10% gain(because it would be really hard to perfectly time that 30% gain exactly), or would it be better to deal with the losses as they come and keep what you have or average down and never sell the stock until retirement?",

        "selftext": "fellow autists, I know I'm not the only retard tired of losing tendies despite $SPY moving lower. well i was scrolling the sub this morning and got inspired by a post (can't find it, will edit in link if I can later) that basically said stop betting against the SPY, start betting against certain companies that actually make up the SPY (also, stop buying fucking FD's, start buying further out puts that are close to ITM) so I made myself a cup of coffee, watched my girl get fucked by her ex boyfriend and his brother, did a lot of math, looked at a bunch of charts, and now I have *the* company to bet against here.\n\nfirst, lets talk about what happened last week. daddy blew a ~~tweet~~ firework up the oil industry's ass, leading to the biggest one-day increase in oil price history. you know whats happened every single time the oil industry has its biggest one-day increase in oil price? it fucking goes down. every. single. time. -17.21% on average before a bottom was reached. average of 79 calendar days to that bottom. \n\nyou know what also happened? $IWM hit lows that it hasn't seen since 2016. it's down 30.72% since March 5th. $SPY is down 19.78% since March 5th. what's that tell us? small businesses are fucked basically. we knew that already though, right? I mean, it's this subs favorite catch phrase \"it's already priced in you retard\" well in this case, yea, it is. on $IWM. it's not totally priced into SPY. you know what though? the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bcomes for everyone eventually. if $SPX were to hit 2016 lows, it'd be at 2075. that's another -16.62% to fall.\n\nanyone ever heard of the 60/40 balanced portfolio? none of you fucking autists probably have, but that's alright. it's a retirement fund made up of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. who cares, right? well actually, it just dropped 20% of peak value for the fourth time in 75 years. what happened those other three times? glad you asked. an average of -12.16% to the low in an average of 27 calendar days.\n\nwhat does this all tell us? for starters, stop betting for/against $IWM. there's no tendies to be made there. but the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bhere have a point, things are looking grim and we're not close to the bottom yet. the problem is you're all getting theta/IV fucked into oblivion because you just fucking NEED that screenshot now and can't trade anything other than SPY \n\nso what exactly can we do with this information? well instead of hoping jpow's printer finally runs out of some fucking ink, we can seek out a vulnerable company...\n\n1. that is down since 3/5 but not down as much as $SPY \n2. is in a vulnerable industry\n3. trades on good volume\n\nlook no further than $AMD. semiconductors are notoriously one of the first to move when the market flips. unlike it's competitors $NVDA and $INTC, they don't have a cloud-computing business. they sell computer chips (APUs and GPUs). the stock is down -11.47% since 3/5. that trails SPY's fall by 8.31%. it jumped up a bit on 3/24 with just about every other tech stock, but it tumbled 4.27% on Friday. they're set to report earnings around the last week of April but they rarely surprise and don't move much on earnings in general. if we're trailing SPY by \\~8% AND we think there's an additional \\~12% to go, there's a lot of upside in the downside here. since we're trailing SPY by about 8%, let's conservatively say there's only 12% left for AMD to move to the downside (instead of \\~20%) a 12% decrease in the stock price would be \\~$37.50 \n\ntl;dr: the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bcomes for everyone, stop betting against SPY, start betting against AMD. it's going down and you can get right on an ITM strike at a relatively cheap price with good volume and a low-ish (low 60s) IV\n\n$AMD 6/19 42p",

        "selftext": "Sup fellow poors.\n\nSo I'm posting here instead of big WSB, primarily because the OI is pretty low on the options I'm about to discuss, but it's perfect for those of us (re)starting small. To that end, let's talk about Cadence Design Systems ($CDNS), who has their Q1 earnings call today.\n\nCadence is provider of CAD software for PCB and integrated circuit design. They bought a simulation software company called AWR back in December, which has everyone's dicks hard because they'll be just about the only company that offers an integrated platform for IC and interconnect design that also does simulation at the dawn of 5G. As both businesses are relatively mature software companies, they've come to enjoy high and growing revenue and a low debt load, which has resulted in them retracing 97% of Februaries ATH. That is to say, they were $80 before the crash, now they're $78.\n\nNow I'm in RF. I do 5G shit. More importantly, I know how fucking much their software costs. We're talking 10's or 100's of $k a per seat per year on some of this shit. Now, they sell into a lot of big chip companies like AMD and NVDA which have done reasonable well during the market bounce. However, they sell to a lot of smaller cap companies, a lot of whom have been getting squeezes since early February when factories in China started shutting down. Because smaller companies tend to renew a lot of software licenses near the beginning of the fiscal year as budget allocations start to become available, this could have major implications for earnings. I'm betting that Q1 budget squeezes and layoffs will motivate smaller businesses to buy fewer seats, or make moves to software from different vendors, which is highly attractive because Cadence's UI is fucking godawful.\n\nNow I could be wrong here. The technology industry could really be as ironclad as market trends seem to indicate and 5G will lead us into some capitalist techno-paradise where stonks only go up. But in my little corner of the RF industry, I've seen some significant layoffs and a looooooot of cancelled PO's. I have to believe that earnings today will fall below expectations, and that we'll see a dip.\n\nIn the interest of getting this out before market close, I'll cut the greeks disclaimer (only monthlies available, weeklies would have been better) and post positions.\n\nTL;DR $CDNS 75p 5/15.  \n\n\nEdit: And sell tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "\n\n \n \nOIL Falters, again\n \nFinancials Rally\n \nThe Russell Leads the Way\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to an upward start and never looked back.  Based on news of re-openings in Italy and France in the works and the restarting of repair work on Notre Dame Cathedral were highlights.  Around 11:30 we had a small selloff that lasted until 1:45 and we lost about 100 DPs but we rallied again making a new high of the day at +428 before closing +358.51 (1.51%), NASDAQ +95.64 (1.11%), S&amp;P 500 +41.74 (1.47%) and the Russell, the big winner, +48.82 (3.96%) and DJ Transports +225.02 (2.78%).  The DJIA was 24 up, 6 down with the biggest gainers were MMM and GS +45, HD +38, DIS +33, V +31, and JPM +27 DPs.  There were no double-digit losers.  Market internals were good with both NYSE and Nasdaq 3.5:1 with light volume.  All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors were up with financials the leaders followed by industrials and retail also strong.  The \u201cleast strong\u201d was consumer staples.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/LfrHz_ROkVw\n \nSECTORS: As I mentioned above, financials lead the way and this is important since for any rally to be sustainable, financials need to participate.  I think we may be playing catch-up with today\u2019s move, and we are pretty overextended at this point.  I am also adding a sector for food supply chain companies.  It is clear that the food supply has problems and since there is no ETF that I know of that covers it, I have put together a short list of the big names.  I have left out supermarkets since they are distribution and not production.\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was HIGHER with TSN +1.18, BGS +.05, FLO +.46, CAG +.42, MDLZ +.09, KHC +.78, CALM +1.95 (4.68%), JJSF +6.72 (5.71%), SAFM +3.66 and LANC +3.74.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was MIXED with BIIB +5.44, ABBV +.76, REGN -22.21 (3.92%), ISRG +2.17, GILD -.14, MYL +.42, TEVA +.50 (4.89%), VRTX -3.84, BHC +1.19, INCY -.50, ICPT +3.22, LABU +1.85 and IBB $127.53 +1.35 (1.07%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.31, CGC +2.21 (14.81%), CRON +.28, GWPH +.18, ACB +.035, PYX +.39, NBEV -.01, CURLF +.47 (10.9%), KERN +.76 (9.22%), and MJ $12.38 +.48 (4.03%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT -2.27, RTX +1.96, GD +5.70, TXT +1.13, NOC +5.50, BWXT +1.72, TDY +3.90 and ITA $151.08 +2.40 (1.61%).\n \n  \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with the exception of WMT -1.06, M +.54, JWN +2.43, KSS +3.05, DDS +2.23, JCP +.014, TGT +2.18, TJX +1.84, RL +6.52 (9.55%), UAA +.50, LULU +11.92 (5.56%), TPR +1.46, CPRI +1.36 and XRT $36.36 +1.82 (5.27%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -5.74, AMZN -32.79, AAPL +.29, FB -2.12, NFLX -3.48, NVDA +9.17, TSLA +57.93 (7.99%), BABA -.46, BIDU -.45, CMG -.22, BA +.90, CAT -.03, DIS +4.86 and XLK $89.19 +.56 (.63%).\n \n  \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +6.60, JPM +3.82, BAC +1.27, MS +1.41, C +3.46, PNC +4.27, AIG +.91, TRV +2.07, AXP +1.73, V +4.48, and XLF $22.48 +.74 (3.4%).\n \n \nOIL, $16.50 +2.72. Oil was a BIG STORY another day of liquidation coupled with the news that USO will not deal in the front month contract (June) and will \u201cladder\u201d maturities of the further out months.  This is the 4th time that they have made changes with this ETF.  From my way of thinking, this will only make it less in line with the actual market moves.  Oil stocks were mixed to higher with CVX +2.89, XOM +.26, OXY +.39, OAS - .07, NBL -.06, MRO -.06, MPC +.84, RIG -.10, APA -.04, BP +.86, HES +.71, and XLE $35.40 +.78 (2.25%).  Just a quick note, Diamond Offshore (DO) filed for bankruptcy and was $ .365 -.5734 (61.1%) on the day.\n \n  \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,723.80 -11.80. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We have spent the last 3 days consolidating the gains and hit $1,720 today.  I will want to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, or if it turns higher without making another low right here.  We are long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,780 + 185. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we\u2019d have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was a continuing move higher.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $8.79 +.24 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

The Oracle of Ohama, Mr. Buffet for you dumb-fucks, sold 15% of his overall stake in the company that he has had for over a decade. If DAL earnings are shit and they are needing a bailout these budgets airline fucks can even stay open for much longer then.",

        "selftext": "First and foremost I am an average investor. Nothing fancy, and around half a year of options experience and I am also very bearish. Technical analysis obviously has some truth to it, it's a tool to allow more accurate decision making but is not an oracle which is why I wanted to question one of the points that continuously get brought up - **volume**. Before the black swan event SPY traded at 50million average, now it's at around 130 million average. Given that there hasn't been extreme bearish news lately, wouldn't it be normal for SPY to be trading at a lower volume? The way I see it SPY shouldn't have increased volume unless there is a reason to, for example - a large GDP decrease, unexpected terrible earnings, a major country going under a 2nd lockdown, mass bankruptcy or extending lockdowns even further. I do believe DOW will decrease in the future but unless a major event happens, I don't see why SPY would gap down a lot within 2-6 weeks since there is also a good chance none of those examples will happen in that timeframe. Insight would be much appreciated.  \n\n\nIWM 7/17 100P, SPY300 5/15",

        "selftext": "Hi all, I have been thinking of trying to get some early positions in cloud stocks. Sadly there aren't many that I have found that have good potential. Most of them that I really like are US only where for now I'm just trying to stay within the TSX. For example the best potential cloud stocks I can find when looking are Microsoft, Docu Sign, Oracle, VMware. \n\nI came across Absolute Software ([ABT.TO](https://ABT.TO)) which so far looks ok. Need to do more research before I commit but was wondering if anyone else out there has other cloud stock they are watching or any advise/information on Absolute. Look forward to the discussion..",

        "selftext": "01:00 PM EDT, 04/28/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Zoom Video Communications (ZM) picked Oracle's (ORCL) cloud platform to support the surge in demand for its product from both consumers and companies as the COVID-19 pandemic drove people into their homes to stem the spread of the respiratory disease.\n\nThe company said in a statement on Tuesday that it needed immediate additional cloud capacity after seeing daily meeting participants spike to 300 million this month, up 50% from March. Zoom had about 10 million free and paid users by the end of December last year, it said earlier this month.\n\n\"We recently experienced the most significant growth our business has ever seen, requiring massive increases in our service capacity,\" said Eric Yuan, Zoom's chief executive. \"We chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure because of its industry-leading security, outstanding performance, and unmatched level of support.\"\n\nZoom's operations have gained attention during the pandemic as users sheltering in their homes signed up for the video platform to connect with coworkers, family and friends. More than 212,000 people have died and 3.06 million have fallen ill from the respiratory disease.\n\nThe stock has surged 134% this year as the outbreak grew, although the shares were 2.8% lower on Tuesday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite turned lower.\n\nYuan said earlier this month it was shifting engineering resources to trust, safety and privacy issues after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it received reports of video conferences being interrupted by hate images, pornography and threats. Last week, Zoom released an upgrade to its program that included \"robust security enhancements.\"\n\nZoom said it's now enabling \"millions\" of meeting participants on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which will help it meet the changing demands of a growing customer base.\n\n\"Video communications has become an essential part of our professional and personal lives, and Zoom has led this industry's innovation,\" said Safra Catz, Oracle's chief executive.\n\nPrice: 159.30, Change: -5.30, Percent Change: -3.22",
