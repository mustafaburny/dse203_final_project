        "selftext": "Some people are familiar with the Irvings who basically own the province of New Brunswick as a private coporation, but our other owners are more keen on the diversification route and own all of us rather than just part of us and they also do so in publicly traded corporations. If you have ever wondered what the Oligarch Index would look like, have no fear, I'll show you.  \n\n\nThe one you might be most familiar with is the Weston's who own Loblaws. However the Weston's don't actually own a majority of it, rather they own 63% of a publicly traded corporation called George Weston which itself owns 47% of Loblaws. Keeping to the strategy of creating russian nesting dolls of companies to basically retain control over companies you effectively only really own a quarter of they have also split off the real estate of the grocery stores into Choice Properties REIT, which is majority owned by Loblaws. Thus the Weston family controls this REIT despite really only owning an eighth of it.  \n\n\nGeorge Weston TSE:WN  \nLoblaws Companies Limited TSE:L  \nChoice Properties TSE:CHP.UN  \n\n\nOn the other side of the Pond, the Weston's also have another Top Order shell called Wittington Investments, which is 80% owned by Garfield Weston Foundation, which is a charity (or \"charity\" for tax avoidance if you feel it more appropriate). The other 20% is owned by individual members of the Weston family. The main holding of Wittington Investments is Associated British Foods at 54.5%, and some department stores in the UK and Ireland. Associated British Foods is a component of the British Stock Exchange Index the FTSE100, much like Loblaws they also own clothing brand/stores, and they also have a monopsony (a situation where there is one buyer rather than a monopoly where there is one seller) where they process the entire Sugar Beet crop of the UK with British Sugar which is responsible for about half of the UK's sugar consumption.  \n\n\nAssociated British Foods LSE:ABF  \n\n\nNext lets move on to the richest man in Canada. Again guess? Hint he is literally a British Lord.  \n\n\nOkay all guesses? It is David Kenneth Roy Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet. The descendants of the late Baron of Fleet own the Woodbridge Corporation which is itself the majority owner of 62.35% Thomson Reuters. The Thomson portion is difficult to explain, as they provide \"business services\", but it seems like the consist in providing information for legal and tax matters. Might be kind of like the Bloomberg of Canada who knows. Reuters was a British media company before it was acquired. How this particular guy became the richest person in Canada is because he actually doesn't even like having to run the family business and instead has started an independent real estate empire. Pinning down exactly what that entails is difficult, but his investment activities are run by a Toronto Hedge Fund Morgan Bay Capital, and the real estate empire is called Osmington Incorporated. Osmington has sold some of its properties to the Canada Pension Plan, and seems to have intersts in \"precision agriculture\" at FarmersEdge whatever that means, and it is a partner in the group that owns the Winnipeg Jets. He is not the richest man in Canada entirely because of Thomson Reuters, but it certainly contributes to it, and what billionaire doesn't own a media conglomerate or two?  \n\n\nThomson Reuters TSE:TRI  \n\n\nNow Galen Weston is the 3rd richest Canadian, and David Thomson is the 1st, so who is on second? Tsai's on second. Joseph Tsai. Taiwanese born co-founder and Executive Vice-Chairman of Alibaba. At 13 he was sent to a prep school in New Jersey, and eventually went to his father's alma mater at Yale. He started his career as a tax associate at a New York lawfirm and eventually became an attorney following in his father's footsteeps. From there however he eventually left for Hong Kong and became involved in Asian private equity, which resulted in him eventually meeting Jack Ma, where he was so impressed that he quit his investment firm to join in the founding of Alibaba as the only western-educated founder where he was COO and CFO as he was vital due to the cross-pacific nature of Alibaba's business model and being the only one with experience in venture capital and law. He is the second largest individual shareholder of Alibaba behind only Jack Ma. Beyond that he also bought the Brooklyn Nets off a Russian billionaire, as well as being the owner of several other sports team like football and including Lacrosse which he was the avid player while in prep school and at Yale.  \n\n\nAlibaba NYSE:BABA  \n\n\nHe is a dual Hong Kong and Canadian citizen. You would think it would be American given most of the time he spent in the west was in America but when you are rich obtaining Canadian citizenship is easy and it provides most of the same benefits as American citizenship. Controversial when on the question of the NBA and Hong Kong, we weighed in stating that many Chinese were angry over tweets in support of Hong Kong because they sounded like support for separatism which is a no go for China.  \n\n\nTaiwanese politics is a bit complex, the KMT the right-wing on the island believes in a United China, its just that this united One China ought to be under the KMT, strong, free, and independent, but ultimately friendly with the West, in the vein of Sun Yat-Sen who was also western educated. It is generally the left-wing DPP which is both more independent of the Taiwanese business community and also thinks of itself as independent from China. Taiwan's biggest trade partner is China, and the KMT sees no issue with this as they see it as business being done from a province of china that is free doing business with other provinces of china which are just temporarily under Communist Party of China occupation.  \n\n\nThe business community loves the One Country Two Systems because it lets them have their cake and eat it too, but if it came down to it since Chinese business is the most important trade partner for the Hong Kong and Taiwan and they are torn when it comes to the CCP power grabbing the two systems into one system. For the business community being one country is more important for the bottom line than the two systems, so while they are against the power grab, they are also against seperatism. This is difficult to understand but many chinese still see a United China as being in a protracted civil war that has just been on pause for decades, the same way people in Korea see the Korean War as a protracted civil war that never ended rather than a war between countries. They want their freedom, but they also want their country to remain united. Ultimately this is not too dissimilar from the powerful Quebec Federalist business families which are generally the historical owners of the Liberal Party who oppose Quebec sovereignty and want a united Canada even if they support francophone rights within Canada  \n\n\nWhich brings as to the Desmarais. Paul Desmarais was the fourth wealthiest person in Canada before he died in 2013, and his family is considered the seventh on the list currently. The Desmarais Family Residual Trust controls Pansolo which itself owns about 80% of the voting shares of the Power Corporation of Canada, but 60% of those votes come from owner almost all of the preferred voting shares which give 10 votes, while they own 11% of the regular shares which translates to another 20% of the voting power. Power Corp is itself a fan of complicated ownership structures as I basically wouldn't even be able to explain all the things they own. The largest holding is 67% of Great West Life and 62% of IGM financial, both of which also have subsidiaries who operate in the United States. The also have a Partnership ownership of Group Brussels Lambert with Frere Bougeois who was the richest man in Belgium while he was alive. As a result of complicated ownership structures, with Frere Bourgeois they actually control a French Materials company called Imerys, and also own minority stakes in Adidas and Pernod Ricard. Overall the European holdings are quite diversified, and its North American holdings in Wealth/Retirement Management and Life Companies functions as a diversified asset pool due to the nature of how life insurance companies use the premiums to invest so they can eventually cover the payouts. They also own wealth management companies in China which makes it globally diversified and sector diversified. Through the complicated ownership structure it owns WealthSimple in part via Power Corp itself, but also through their majority stake in IGM financial. They also have a renewable energy division where they live up to the \"Power\" name, and beyond renewable energy they also have a 60% stake in Lumenpulse an LED manufacturer, and a 44% stake in Lion Electric and electric school bus manufacturer.   \n\n\nPower Corp TSE:POW\n\nGreat West Life TSE:GWO\n\nIGM Financial TSE:IGM\n\nGroup Brussels Lambert EBR:GBLB  \n\n\nI own Power Corp shares because I couldn't believe it was trading as low as it was and for so long, as it has a 9% yield it has since gone up almost immediately after I bought it so I got in at the right time but still has a 7% yield. Power Corp is likely the closest you will get to the concept of the revolving door of politicians in business which you can read up yourself, but safe to say all our Francophone prime ministers have been involved, mostly Liberal leaders like Chretien, Martin, and Pierre Trudeau, but also Brain Mulroney, and many Premiers of Ontario and Quebec as well. If there was ever a company that made the concept of \"the Laurentian Elite\" that run Canada clear, it is Power Corp. In regards to my politics, I'm actually in favour of the concept of seperatism as a general idea so I'm sort of inverting my politics in my investments, but despite me supporting seperatism generally, the only victory for the concept in decades has been Brexit and even then that was not really the same thing. I'm politically infavour of renewable power so I found Power Corp attractive for its investments in Power Energy. Seems as if a good investment strategy would be to inverse your political positions which have never had victories like ever and go long on your political positions which seem to be where the political headwinds are going. Power Corp seems to get its way in politics regardless if I am in support of it lol, might as well own the company that controls everything I guess.  \n\n\nThe guy who owns Rogers is next on our line of Oligarchs. Rogers is similar to Power Corp in that they attempt to have voting shares and non-voting shares so the family can control the company while not actually owning the whole thing.   \n\n\nRogers TSE: RCI.A prefered voting shares  \nRogers TSE: RCI.B non-voting shares for us plebs  \n\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_Canadians\\_by\\_net\\_worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadians_by_net_worth) \n\nYou can look at the full list here but I'm going to stop as Saputo as they are the dreaded Milk Cartel of the Bernier's nightmares\n\nSaputo TSE:SAP  \n\n\nRapid Fire Round  \n\n\nGarret Camp NYSE:UBER\n\nIrvings (Private, Oil, New Brunswick)\n\nRichardson (Private, Agricultural and Food Production)\n\nJim Pattison (Private, British Columbia Conglomerate, fun fact owns Guinness World Records)\n\nJeffery Skoll (NASDAQ:EBAY, Participant a privately owned film production studio)\n\nRichard Li (Hong Kong Telecom, SEHK:8)\n\nAzireli Family (Israeli Real Estate, TLV:AZRG, fun fact the Azireli Towers used to be the tallest buildings in Israel)\n\nCarlo Fidani (Mississauga based real estate)  \n\n\nBernard Sherman (Privately held Pharmaceutical company Apotex)   \n\n\nMcCain family (Beyond McCain foods, Wallace McCain after being ousted from McCain by his brother Harrison purchased Maple Leaf Foods together with the Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan ... somehow lets not question it.
