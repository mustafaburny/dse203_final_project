        "selftext": "\u25b6 **PRIMER:**\n\nBelow is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID. I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.\n\nI'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.\n\n*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish \"DD.\" I had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum.* ***I've removed all links*** *to appease the WSB automoderator which doesn't seem to want to let anything through. Random asterisks and parentheticals were previously outside resources.*\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **BACKGROUND:**\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3yhtwgjkcj71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcc307a4b2ab5d8fdaa0c86d71ee3e0e50ed459\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58e0bwpkkcj71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c430e6b2db149da642c7e62784b7990523dbbb2d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m25tqedmkcj71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a50a1d0566d8ff6872f588de307ce5a41a33870f\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlbjwa1okcj71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca1292576948128353dacebbbb24686bb98cb6c2\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n[\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*](https://preview.redd.it/fsgu9uhpkcj71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18cabbf7c21f7a9aeb8790fb65b7d5e5d53b664d)\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/i728mi0rkcj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9bcf294372eb8ca630905dabc87ce31d1e3d181)\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnl4utvskcj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=668d97028ea2ccb95a11d1a8c3c4cf476aa56f93\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/czx96l9ukcj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e18981f489b11a8a7ec5f4d4b3ca74d5cdc2561\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qetnfmvkcj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48148b612d6d7030ccd91419e5a574294483bc28\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*|18.33\\*|\n|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*|0.81\\*|\n|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.51\\*|\n|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.51\\*|\n|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*|12.7\\*|\n|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*|0.37\\*|\n|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.37\\*|\n|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\\*|N/A *(see below)*|\n|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*|N/A|\n|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*|N/A|\n|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*|N/A|\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nI personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.\n\n[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/nbfewd7xkcj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6a91f908af657fb38ec9813ab35713781fa067f)\n\nFundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend (tweet). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **COMMON QUESTIONS:**\n\n**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***\n\n**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 (page 169). Here's a prior post thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.\n\n**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***\n\n**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however he speculated it may be October (Q4).\n\n**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***\n\n**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and \"near completion\"\\*.\n\n**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***\n\n**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue here (start at 4:00).\n\n**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (examples*** 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **PERSONAL POSITION:**\n\nI won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like \"proof or ban\" I will happily provide screen shots privately.\n\n*^(Disclaimer: Nothing above or below constitutes professional and/or financial advice, nor does any information presented here constitute a comprehensive or complete statement of the matters discussed.

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO were weak Monday after a fatal accident involving a NIO car with self-driving features.\n\nThe fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO\u2019s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.\n\nNIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar\u2014a laser-based radar\u2014and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.\n\nThe NAD features don\u2019t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.\n\nNIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.\n\nThe global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.\n\nLink: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508)",

        "selftext": "In spite of the \"SPACs are dead\" zeitgeist, thanks to the SPAC frenzy during the bubble SPAC teams in general undoubtedly have more high quality sponsors now than ever before. Bad price action, pessimistic sentiment and the arb trap are what they are, but more legit unicorn list companies have DA'd since the crash than the entire history of SPACs prior to that, and quality companies continue to DA at competitive multiples to competition. Many of these SPAC teams have significant reputations on the line and are expected to deliver high quality long term investments, regardless of short term trading action.\n\nSince I am predominantly a pre-DA warrants investor, when vetting SPAC teams I like to look for: \n\na.) past successful SPAC experience; \n\nb.) high level of specialized experience in the sector of focus (for example, FTPA/FTVI/HERA/SCLE's Betsy Cohen and ACQR's Steven McLaughlin are specialized experts at fintech and know the field like the back of their hand).

        "selftext": "I'm wondering if Intel producing its own GPU is a good sign, and will perhaps be able to compete with Nvidia.  They own the fabs, they own much of the enterprise, and they will even begin producing other companies chips in their fabs; which they rapidly under construction, funded by the US government.\n\nIs this a good reason to be bullish for Intel, assuming their new fabs are will be competitive?

        "selftext": "Micron Technology(NASDAQ:MU) is the 4th largest distributor of semiconductors in the world leading in production of DRAM and NAND. Analysts predict a one year stock value median of $120  compared to current $82. My own calculation, which skews more conservative, has them at 118.12% with a 30.6 Margin of Safety. \n\nLooking at valuation, they consistently surprise EPS expectations. Last quarter they beat an expected 1.72 at 1.88 and have an expected EPS of 2.32 for Q3. Their PE of 22.63 is below the industry's 31.97x, has P/B of 2.17 compared to industry's 14.2x, P/S is 3.62 compared to Industry's 12.18, PEG Ratio is .36 compared to industry's .12. Altogether, a great start. \n\nFundamentally, looking at their financials they did take a big hit in 2019 because of the semiconductor supply shortage. Look up price of GPU from 2019 to today and you'll quickly see what I mean. This impacted their sales and earnings. In 2018 their high was 31B Revenue and 14B in earnings. With COVID and that stock shortage already there, 2020 earnings had tumbled to 21.43 B and a meager 2.69B. If you go to quarterlies though, they're currently smashing it. They're last quarterly was simply phenomenal. Revenue of 7.42 B, and earnings of 1.74B. Year to Year and Year to quarterly is just fantastic from where they were. Next year they're predicting an EBIDA growth of 20%. Very ambitious estimate and while definitely not sustainable for 5 year period, a one year 20% EBIDA prediction is still very good.\n\nMany things in their favor is they're buying back shares. They're starting to buy back shares. Its not much, but last quarter saw the first decrease in ordinary share number and increase in treasury shares. This is course change from previous quarters of a slight dilution they've had. Its not as intense as Intel's buyback, but it shows management's belief that they're undervalued. They also just announced a dividend. Its small, 10 cents a share, but you don't do that unless you're confident. It also gets on the radar of intuitions that require a dividend. They're domestic so there is no concentration on foreign crackdowns. In fact, in 2019 Huawei was 14% of their business and the USA restriction already had that hit. \n\nSome hits against them are that there are other competitors. Multiple companies have the cash to to invest in hyper expansion like Intel and Ti. Since the start of the shortage, MU has had decreased earnings and revenue seeing shrinkage of about 28% from their 2018 high. Until recently, they weren't  that cash flow positive and have been taking on more debt to power expansion. This may effect DCF calculations. Its more held by institutions than insiders so while the board has an obligation to share holders, it won't keep them up at night. I\n\nSome insight to the semiconductors as a whole. US Gov passed a bill a couple months back approving funding for domestic semicondutor chip development of 50B. So they're not prone to the infrastructure bill may or may not passing, they already have increased federal funding. Also, DRAM and NAND are respectively dynamic memory and logic gates necessary for computers to function. DRAM is expected to increase 16% in sales and NAND is expected to go  up 30%. DRAM makes up a larger portion of sales for MU to NAND. However, none of these things are going away. These are core components of any development and are only looking to increase in demand.\n\nAnother competitor you might want to look at is Western Digital (WDC). They have similar fundamentals and potential for growth. However, Micron has better ratios at the moment  so that's why I chose to focus on it. Either one I think is a greatly undervalued stock with MU just being better.",

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 2, 2021**\n\nStocks continued volatility from last week, with the three major indexes opening the day in the green before turning lower towards the end in the first trading session in August. As has been the case for at least a few weeks now, it seems the market will continue to perform a careful balancing act between record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion and concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 20009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\nIn the last few weeks, concerns over the coronavirus Delta variant are increasing, which inevitably, has injected volatility in the markets. Last week, the CDC reversed their indoor mask policy. The agency now recommends that even fully vaccinated individuals begin once again wearing masks indoors in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, \u201cIn areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools\u201d. \n\nAs I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, while cases are surging, thankfully, hospitalizations and death rates are much lower when compared to previous surges, a sign that the vaccine is doing its job. While it doesn\u2019t prevent one from becoming infected, it greatly reduces the possibility for complications. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nMoreover, last week, the Fed released its July Monetary Policy Report largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The report also acknowledged potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In a big industry move, Square (SQ) acquired Australian fin-tech company Afterpay, which allows customers to pay in installments, for $29 billion in an all-stock transaction. Square released a statement that read, \u201cSquare plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL \\[buy now, pay later\\] at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover merchants and BNPL offers directly within the app.\u201d\n* Along with the Afterpay announcement, SQ unexpectedly announced Q2 earnings, which showed gross profit growing 91% thanks to strong Cash App and Seller ecosystem growth. The company reported revenue of $4.68 billion, 87% growth year-on-year but below the the $5.03 billion expected. Earnings per share skyrocketed to $0.66 compared to $0.30 expected.\n* Google announced it was moving away from Qualcomm (QCOM) and would begin manufacturing its own in-house processors for new Pixel phones launching later this year. This follows a similar move to what Apple (AAPL) did to Intel (INTC).\n* Ford Motors (F) Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the company hopes to reinstate a dividend by the end of the year. He said, \u201cWe've had a really tough period of time here the last couple of years with Covid last year and now the chip shortage. We plan to bring the dividend back as soon as we can...depending on how the second half goes with \\[computer\\] chips, it could be as early as the end of this year.\u201d Ford suspended its dividend last year.\n* Electric vehicle sales in China more than tripled in July compared to a year ago. \n   * Nio delivered 7,931 vehicles in July, 124% increase YoY\n   * Xpeng (XPEV) delivered 8,040 vehicles, 228% increase YoY\n   * Li (LI) delivered 8,589 vehicles, 251% increase YoY\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Abbvie (ABBV) with two target raises.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 24, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their strong performance, recovering from jitteriness last week to reach new intraday record highs in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ). The Dow Jones (DIA) traded modestly even and remains roughly $2 from its record high. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued rallying after steeply underperforming last week, climbing roughly 3% in the last two days. After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give his annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\nKeith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist at Truist Financial, gave this take about earnings, \u201cWe think the primary trend is higher. We\u2019re only about one year into this economic expansion. Expansions typically last about five years, And the earnings season which we just got out of was phenomenal. Even if it\u2019s peak growth, we still think it\u2019s going to be strong growth. You have earnings moving forward and then you look at the relative comparison of stocks relative to bonds and they\u2019re still attractive. Overall, we think the right position is to be overweight stocks.\u201d\n\nUS Crude oil prices gained for a second straight session, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.\n\nEnergy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.

        "selftext": "We have all read the previous BB to the moon DD's so let me get to the point.  I don't think the idea of them entering the car business or any of the chip development patents they hold is a valid idea.  Here is why, Tesla.  Look at the current AI they have and how they develop everything (chip set included) in house.  What this means to me is similar to what happened to cellphones before and after google developed the android operating system.  In short Android killed all the competitors, who were not apple, as they could not keep up with its innovation and development.  I think the same will happen to BB and the overall value of the stock will tank in about 5 years when this becomes obvious to everyone when Tesla starts to hit real economies of scale and has fully realized self driving.  That's why I am now out of BB.\n\nThat brings me to the second point which is Intel.  I know lots of people are crapping on them as it seems to me everyone thinks AMD has them cornered and will eat their lunch.  But what if Intel is not as stupid as everyone seems to think? What if they are smart and see where the future of chip development is going?  What if they see that Tesla and all the car manufactures are going to NEED chips to power mobile moving computers on wheels for easily the next 30 years and this is where the market is going. Look at the current chip shortages as an example.   Rather than spending billions in R&amp;D for PC chips for incremental improvements into a saturated market that will diminish over time wouldn't it make sense to position yourself to be the primary chip manufacture  in a market that really hasn't even reached 1% saturation yet?  If you become the go to manufacture for everyone do you really even care if CPU chips for essentially obsolete desktops and laptops are sacrificed?  Look at windows 11 where it will run native android apps.  Consider the fact that like chrome books there could be a fundamental merging of basic computers to something closer to tablets and where huge amounts of processing power is not needed and rather power efficiency is more critical.  What if Intel execs see the writing on the wall and realize that the future of computers is going to be about mobility and efficiency.   Perhaps they realize they don't want to end up like Kodak and go out of business when the whole industry shifted to digital pictures.  Better to be the sole go to manufacture and corner the new market for the next 30 years.",

        "selftext": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) a buy after its impressive Q2 earnings?\n\n# Last earnings:\n\n* Q2 Figures:\n\nFor the quarter that ended on August 1st, Nvidia generated a record $6.51 billion in revenues, exceeding the expected $6.33 billion. Revenue rose 68% annually whereas, in the previous quarter, sales grew 84%. Adjusted earnings amounted to $1.04, exceeding expectations of $1.01.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Graphics Segment:\n\nThe segment which is primarily made up of graphics cards grew 87% to $3.91 billion or more descriptively, faster than the compute and network segment, which includes chips for data centers, which grew 46% to $2.6 billion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Gaming Market\n\nWhen it comes to markets, gaming was one of the highlights, its sales went up 85% compared to last year and reached $3.06 billion. This increase is owed both to GeForce graphics card sales and the chips it sells to game console makers, such as the processor which is at the heart of the Nintendo Switch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Data Center Business\n\nDue to graphics cards for data centers, both industrial use and among cloud providers, this business also hit an all-time high as it grew 35% annually to $2.37 billion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Professional Visualization\n\nThe segment that consists mostly of graphics cards for high-end professional workstations went up 156% annually to $519 million. Its automotive business remains a small portion of the company's sales, with sales of $152 million, down sequentially from the previous quarter but up 37% from last year's respective quarter that was shaped by the global pandemic that halted auto production.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* CPM Fell Short\n\nThe company's new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP), the dedicated chips it makes for cryptocurrency mining, failed to hit Nvidia's own predictions. It reported $266 million in cryptocurrency card sales, as opposed to $400 million it predicted, making the prediction 33% off. CMP sales were likely impacted by China's cryptocurrency crackdown as miners were selling off used graphics processing units.\n\nNvidia says its cryptocurrency cards are an effort to ensure there is sufficient chip supply for gamers and it applied software to its GPUs to prevent them from mining cryptocurrencies. Going forward, Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, expects a \"minimal contribution\" from CMP sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Potential Dangers :\n\nSupply issues that began late last year are still in the air, as Nvidia's latest line of graphics cards has remained mostly sold out in stores and it was seeing longer lead times throughout its supply chain. But this is not a surprise as the company announced back in May that it expected supply issues to persevere throughout the second half of the year. This time around, it revealed it expects GPU supply constraints for the \u2018vast majority of 2022 as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#  Catalysts:\n\nData centers -- the computing units that form the backbone of cloud computing -- are also ramping up their use of GPUs, putting them to work as computing accelerators to handle complex workloads and applications like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia has had a flurry of innovation on this front in recent years, unleashing a slew of new chips designed for these data center customers. It also made the acquisition of networking hardware company Mellanox early last year to bolster this emerging area of expertise. As a result, the data center segment hauled in $2.37 billion in sales in Q2 and has been steadily catching up to the gaming unit in size.\n\nFor comparison, when the cryptocurrency crash of 2018 sent Nvidia sliding backward (during Nvidia's fiscal 2019), data centers represented only about one-quarter of total revenue. They now account for more than one-third of the total.\n\nNvidia is only just getting started on this front, too. Some of its more recent hardware announcements for data centers haven't even begun to be commercialized yet. This is a huge segment of the semiconductor industry that has long been dominated by **Intel**. Tens of billions in annual sales are up for grabs if Nvidia's innovations can continue to steadily garner momentum.\u00a0\n\n# TLDR:\n\nFor the undergoing quarter, Nvidia expects $6.8 billion in revenue exceeding Refinitiv expectations of $6.5 billion. The company is in a period of sustained, massive growth in its business as semiconductors are in short supply across the globe while the demand for the kind of processors it specializes in is skyrocketing. Not surprisingly, over the last year, its shares are up over 57%. Granted, another uptick in cryptocurrency activity would help, but it isn't a primary catalyst for this chip designer. This is the best long-term semiconductor investment around, as it benefits from multiple secular growth trends in the global economy.",

        "selftext": "Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO were weak Monday after a fatal accident involving a NIO car with self-driving features.  \n\n\nThe fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO\u2019s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.  \n\n\nNIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar\u2014a laser-based radar\u2014and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.  \n\n\nThe NAD features don\u2019t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.  \n\n\nNIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.  \n\n\nThe global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.\n\nLink: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508)",

        "selftext": "Hey all, I\u2019m just some tech nerd who likes to dabble in investing and \"investing.\" However, there is a company that I\u2019m interacting with that, frankly, I\u2019m surprised hasn\u2019t blown up higher than they are. Figured I\u2019d share it on a much more popular place, because I think it deserves a little love.\u00a0\n\nAmbarella ($AMBA) is a somewhat small (3.4B market cap as of writing this) semiconductor company that seems to be very focused on creating the best computer vision processors out there. They also make really good, normal application processors that have fantastic video processing capabilities. I've gotten my hands on them a bit, not as much as I would like, but I see some promise in their new stuff and think they're undervalued.\u00a0\n\n# Competition:\n\nBasically if you think of AI vision processing you probably have the one behemoth in mind: Nvidia. How the hell is this company that's worth 1/200th of Nvidia going to compete? Well it comes down to architecture. Nvidia slams the same design from their top end A series card to their lowest end GPU, designed for hardcore parallel processing like you would expect a GPU to be. This works for sure, but it is inefficient for pure vision processing, compared to a purpose built processor. Ambarella can do stereoscopic vision processing in their highest end processor in a silicon die that's probably at least 5x smaller than Nvidia's highest end processor, at likely significantly less cost too. That's a big deal for both power efficiency, and pure cost.\u00a0\n\nAMBA is also one of two companies that has an AI vision and video processing API with AWS. I bet you can guess the other one. That's great for developers to get used to the ecosystem, and easy access to new talent that may be able to bring their employer in.\u00a0\n\nI am unaware of any other company that has nearly the level of ability in their processors for computer vision. With the constant increase of self driving startups out there, I can only imagine that AMBA playing at the top of the field alone will be huge, as not every single company can afford hundreds of millions to design their own silicon, like Tesla did after moving away from NVDA.\u00a0\n\n# Catalysts:\n\nAMBA is holding their earnings one week from now, August 31st. This will be the first earnings that they are going to have been working with ARVL and KeepTruckin. KeepTruckin handles 90,000 drivers in the US currently, and ARVL has at least 10k sales planned in the future. I\u2019ll let those people talk more about what\u2019s going on there, I\u2019m not up to date with the car manufacturer space and I\u2019m pretty sure that they were a meme stock at some point, so they\u2019ll probably go crazy talking about all their sales that I\u2019m hoping they get.\u00a0\n\nHaving more customers as a semiconductor company creating products on high end process nodes is *basically free* when you\u2019re running in lower quantities. Why? How? Well it just comes down to the massive non-recurring costs in semiconductor manufacturing. This is something the semiconductor people know well, but I\u2019ll give a rough outline for those of you not in the know. Manufacturing silicon on the most cutting edge nodes is insanely expensive, even if you\u2019re just wanting to produce one single die, you\u2019re spending tens, or hundreds of millions of dollars just to make the patterns to make your chip. For TSMC 7nm it\u2019s likely in the hundred to hundreds of millions of dollars that you have to spend once. Every single wafer you buy gets made with those patterns. Each wafer costs money of course, but each one pales in comparison to the amount you spend in the actual photomasks to make your chips.\n\nIf they end up selling more chips, the NR costs get spread out over more, allowing either more competitive pricing if they want, or just more profit. With what is probably 100k of their top end chip sales public, that's a big deal for AMBA as each of their chips costs probably ~$50 to make, and probably sells for significant multiples of that. They are also definitely selling many more than that in more low-end devices like security cameras and action cameras, but that's not the high end flashy cool tech so I'm not gonna bore everyone with that.\u00a0\n\n# Future: \n\nThis is more of a \"what I see and what I want\" kinda section. I'm very much an outsider, and it's very hard to get any word from the company, so everything here should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nI can definitely see AMBA upping their software friendliness and taking a page out of Nvidia's book and making a Jetson competitor. As I said in the title, they're a very quiet company. I would have never heard about them had I not been working with building software for action cameras. Getting their products and software into the hands of real developers to create products with their chips, regardless of if they sell 100 or 100k would be good for sales directly, and massive for brand recognition. AMBA is competing directly with custom silicon, like what's in Tesla, Waymo in my opinion, and if they can get a good enough product that it's worth these big companies not spending hundreds of millions to make their own silicon and instead just using the CV2 processor or whatever comes next, that's be great. I'm seeing the same thing that happened way back in the 90s with companies that had their own custom processors just moving to Intel or AMD because it just didn't make sense to spend the money designing and building their own processor when they could just use someone else's. If AMBA could become the Intel or AMD of computer vision, that's be pretty huge. \n\n## Position and plan\n\nWhat am I planning on doing? Well, hodling my 100 shares. I\u2019m no rich man, and frankly although I think this earnings will be fantastic, good news isn\u2019t always correlated with good stock price. So dumb shares it is, no options or anything.\u00a0",

I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.\n\nI'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.\n\n*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish \"DD.\" I also had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum. All links to Lucid's website had to be removed because WSB has it flagged.*\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **BACKGROUND:**\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/456169/lucid-motors-completed-amp1-plant-capacity-stands-30000/). Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase[\\*](https://wccftech.com/lucid-group-lcid-opens-multiple-vacancies-related-to-finished-vehicles-as-the-company-moves-one-step-closer-to-initiating-deliveries/), with early construction already having begun[\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YH9m1mInVc). Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/517738/lucid-two-horse-race-tesla/) In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21[\\*](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33393428/lucid-air-aerodynamics-drag-coefficient-specs/), bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b699n62bhbj71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3954bdae089e319407a0d7d2a4d5e359fb7804bd\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** ([picture version](https://i.redd.it/uf2s1rfsyfe71.png)):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded ([info](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/4477861))\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) ([article](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1106675_atieva-atvus-electric-car-image-emerges-is-it-tesla-competition))\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQn9DLOQWZg&amp;list=TLPQMzEwNzIwMjHrU1pRCKrmWw&amp;index=3))\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed **Lucid Motors (**[article](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1106851_electric-car-startup-atieva-now-called-lucid-teases-first-car))\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva ([article](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15344498/lucid-formerly-known-as-atieva-will-be-the-sole-battery-pack-supplier-for-formula-e/))\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show ([video](https://abc7.com/los-angeles-auto-show-la-electric-cars-vehicles/2708944/))\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHJ17YdJC5I))\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aRbhWk99Xk))\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXbl8BS-bPE))\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) ([article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-investment-auto/saudis-pif-invests-more-than-1-billion-in-electric-carmaker-lucid-motors-idUSKCN1LX1IG), [press release](https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=46))\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network ([article](https://media.electrifyamerica.com/en-us/releases/7))\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p7JD4ZYr5Q))\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory ([article](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/02/lucid-motors-breaks-ground-on-its-700-million-arizona-factory/))\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WslL6alQUns))\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem ([article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF), press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca ([article](https://www.businessinsider.com/lucid-motors-air-laguna-seca-track-tesla-model-s-plaid-2020-10))\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA ([article](https://insideevs.com/news/447170/lucid-motors-opens-beverly-hills-showroom/))\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain ([article](https://the-race.com/formula-e/powertrain-tech-supplier-picked-for-gen3-formula-e-car/))\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes CCIV rumor ([article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac))\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin ([video](https://youtu.be/yn74wHMMFJU?t=64))\n* Feb 2021 - CCIV-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds[\\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a34224854/lucid-air-with-3-electric-motors-laps-laguna-seca-in-1-31/). Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/frx3jjdfhbj71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efe819073f7191164574b89d29ca50775533bc34\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/42m8tpnghbj71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0813707775d46df4d5f4d5ce80e95e05eb500d63\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)[\\*](https://youtu.be/lXD31SfCjIY?t=1326):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vwey9mihbj71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1d2c3190a03ad0c16cb7f8d4f8b2b73435288c9\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW[\\*](https://www.porsche.com/usa/models/taycan/taycan-models/taycan-turbo/). The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW[\\*](https://www.tesla.com/models).\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier[\\*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF). While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)[\\*](https://youtu.be/7ZkuJY1GWtE?t=312). Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells[\\*](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127084_lucid-air-electric-sedan-builds-on-company-s-formula-e-experience). This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week[\\*](https://www.everydayonsales.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/KFC-Holiday-Bucket-Promo.jpg).\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities[\\*](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/59057/tesla-admits-full-self-driving-is-just-level-2-autonomy/). Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yjdk67khbj71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76656cb5374ade6c508bee92238d65f1aa23eb3b\n\n*\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*[\\*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/08/11/electric-vehicle-incentives-infrastructure/)\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built[\\*](https://carbuzz.com/news/lucids-tesla-model-x-rival-spied-completely-undisguised) using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/8egwb3hlhbj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7961ac8bfe67a1c3654bee97b85c05d86659ce)\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979[\\*](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/events/135227/alumni-spotlight-peter-rawlinson/). Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)[\\*](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-announces-senior-engineering-and-manufacturing-executives). At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production[\\*](https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-12-tesla-chief-engineer-peter-rawlinson-geeks-out-with-us-about-mod.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJrjTpWt05Qoc0TfxoaUHcwrkuS_gSqFKSazihZIDOklzMjVzPIs1E3aGOn8__QaPZu2eVu-8tU3zFZ3QtBOJIFEIDrncY-dVHQZXKMk8bRrhHzTmi5grVvvVQq_88MoyqOU3KvalEYeDoxsXz_U6oQ2FdWt06_GdSmrg3ZUXKmw). Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter[\\*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1303495330223198208?lang=en); however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/505126/elon-musk-tweet-rawlinson-not-chief-engineer/).\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021[\\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherry-house). Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo). She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally[\\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-jenkins-2016483b). Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrcyx49ohbj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72b2adfb17e5d05b95c283aea6176b79b67f50bb\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com[\\*](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lucid-Motors-Reviews-E698305_P2.htm). There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year[\\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35823089/lucid-motors-ceo-defends-its-financial-practices/).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020 ([graph](https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cars-vs-evs-per-1000-people.jpg))[\\*](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/lcid-stock-trust-historical-trends/). This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021**\\***. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year*[*\\**](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-093160/)*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ds777ywphbj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e7fe8165ccfc777ae54071d4266587d9239f91d\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life[\\*](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/). Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n[Lucid Energy Storage System \\(ESS\\)](https://preview.redd.it/pe6s1c6rhbj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2f301a679eb4e9c2d01cf448f979587519147f)\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022[\\*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/saudi-backed-lucid-in-talks-for-electric-car-factory-near-jeddah) and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-20-billion-winner-of-the-american-ev-startup-boom-saudi-arabia-11626687002). If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA/financials)|18.33[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/ps_ratio)|\n|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TM/financials)|0.81[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TM/ps_ratio)|\n|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DE/XHAM/VOW/financials)|0.51[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/VWAGY/ps_ratio)|\n|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM/financials)|0.51[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/GM/ps_ratio)|\n|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NIO/financials)|12.7[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/ps_ratio)|\n|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HNDAF/financials)|0.37[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/HMC/ps_ratio)|\n|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/F/financials)|0.37[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/F/ps_ratio)|\n|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\\*|N/A *(see below)*|\n|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/XPEV/financials)|N/A|\n|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LI/financials)|N/A|\n|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/FSR/financials)|N/A|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion[\\*](https://www.calculator.net/present-value-calculator.html?c1futurevalue=22800000&amp;c1yearsv=4.25&amp;c1interestratev=10&amp;x=64&amp;y=17#future-money). *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52[\\*](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_valuation_ttm.php?ps&amp;s=1000) so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO[\\*](https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2021-05-28/electric-vehicle-firm-rivian-could-seek-70-billion-valuation-in-ipo-bloomberg-news).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nI personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.\n\n[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD \\(8\\/24\\/2021\\)](https://preview.redd.it/mzpxtdjthbj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=939a2a8df5445403e49942ccbb163a72c7893226)\n\nFundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend ([tweet](https://twitter.com/LucidMotors/status/1429935712447565824)). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too[\\*](https://www.instagram.com/p/CS1oQTnnqzq/?hl=en).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **COMMON QUESTIONS:**\n\n**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***\n\n**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 ([page 169](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921098447/tm2123573-3_s1.htm)). Here's a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oss4my/why_pipes_wont_sell_off_all_their_lcid_shares/) thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.\n\n**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***\n\n**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however [he speculated it may be October (Q4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p9jcte/update_from_jonny_liebermans_ig_story/).\n\n**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***\n\n**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and \"near completion\"\\*.\n\n**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***\n\n**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue [here](https://cheddar.com/media/ev-maker-lucid-motors-ipo-ceo-q4-vehicle-delivery) (start at 4:00).\n\n**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (example*** [1](https://preview.redd.it/tb2p3flhvji71.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a900df13b5d4f24a1433af338cf3b7ba19091b29)***,*** [2](https://preview.redd.it/81itpelhvji71.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36e8a23399b31462f914be74fbf708d4df89d732)***,*** [3](https://preview.redd.it/qeje8har6aj71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ac773d093076d049ee46aae30516bbefe554b1)***,*** [4](https://preview.redd.it/r4jfpqus3zi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a90639a2bdc1244193db88e6b987af31583099)***)***\n\n**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers[\\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p8a5v7/beware_peter_rawlinson_is_the_last_surviving/).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **PERSONAL POSITION:**\n\nI won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like \"proof or ban\" I will happily provide screen shots privately.\n\n*^(Disclaimer: Nothing above or below constitutes professional and/or financial advice, nor does any information presented here constitute a comprehensive or complete statement of the matters discussed.

        "selftext": "I am still very bullish on semiconductors and have been buying AMD (and later TSMC) for quite some time. After the recent run in AMD I sold a part of my position, figuring it might cool off and I could take some profits. While I was thinking about where I wanted to reinvest I started to think about Nvidia which became quite interesting after their recent split. I kinda also wanted ASML and finally did some DD on Intel (Intel could go either way). At this point I figured, I might as well just buy a semiconductor ETF and play it safe. Year to date TSMC and AMD were both outperformed by VanEck Vectors Semiconductor UCITS ETF (VVSM) anyway, so I would have made more if the same amount of cash would have gone in the ETF. The ETF has a 0.35% fee so I should keep that in mind. And yes, YTD NVIDIA and ASML were the better choice, but I've been in AMD a bit longer and TSMC might have been a bad choice (bought in february). \n\nI see three options next (10+ year investment horizon + DCA for these):\n\n1. Invest in TSMC, AMD, NVIDIA, ASML and let them ride. \n\n2. Play it safe and go for the ETF that consists of 10.8% NVIDIA, 10.5% ASML, 9.3% TSMC, 8.7% Intel, 6.11% AMD and a bunch of others (25 positions total) in the same sector. \n\n3 A bit more risk/reward: pick a potential winner and go all in with either NVIDIA, ASML or AMD. \n\nSo what would you do?

        "selftext": "\n\nSHANGHAI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China's regulatory agency is launching an investigation into chip distributors in the auto industry, citing suspicions of price gouging, it said on Tuesday.\n\nThe action by the State Administration For Market Regulation (SAMR) is the latest in a regulatory crackdown following a range of companies and industries targeted over the past year as the Chinese government clamps down on industry.\n\n\"In response to prominent problems such as speculation and high prices in the automotive chip market, the State Administration of Market Supervision has recently filed an investigation on car chip distributors,\" the agency said.\n\nThe firms were suspected of driving up prices, based on price monitoring and reporting clues, it added in its statement, and vowed to investigate and punish illegal acts such as hoarding, price-gouging and collusion.\n\nA global shortage of chips that began last December has disrupted supply chains and the hardware sector worldwide. Though initially concentrated in the automotive sector, it has since spread to affect a wide range of gadgets.\n\nPanic about supply uncertainty has occasionally led chip buyers and distributors to purchase more chips than they need, creating a vicious cycle that further drives up prices.\n\nIn June, the chief executive of chipmaker Intel said he expected the shortage to hit bottom by year-end, with the market retuning to normalcy only by 2023.\n\nIn April China's regulator imposed a record fine of $2.75 billion on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive practices.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/china-regulator-investigate-auto-chip-distributors-suspicion-price-gouging-2021-08-03/\n\n**Ok, this is getting a bit out of hand. A constant barrage of bearish news coming out of China after some stabilizing that happened at the end of last week. Not sure what the endgame here is for China or the CCP. On one hand, it makes no sense for them to lose the confidence of foreign investors with moves like this. Are they pushing the boundaries of patience of investors? Or is this a deliberate attempt to crackdown on each sector one by one?**\n\n*Stocks likely to be affected by this: AMD, INTC, QCOM, NVDA.

I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.\n\nI'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.\n\n*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish \"DD.\" I had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum. Many links have been removed to appease the WSB automoderator, including Lucid's own website. Random asterisks without a link were previously outside resources.*\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **BACKGROUND:**\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/456169/lucid-motors-completed-amp1-plant-capacity-stands-30000/). Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase[\\*](https://wccftech.com/lucid-group-lcid-opens-multiple-vacancies-related-to-finished-vehicles-as-the-company-moves-one-step-closer-to-initiating-deliveries/), with early construction already having begun[\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YH9m1mInVc). Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/517738/lucid-two-horse-race-tesla/) In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21[\\*](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33393428/lucid-air-aerodynamics-drag-coefficient-specs/), bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cpzqxcxfqbj71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6832e4a767bd9ba7e03fec526981eedde3c92b85\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** ([picture version](https://i.redd.it/uf2s1rfsyfe71.png)):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded ([info](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/4477861))\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) ([article](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1106675_atieva-atvus-electric-car-image-emerges-is-it-tesla-competition))\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQn9DLOQWZg&amp;list=TLPQMzEwNzIwMjHrU1pRCKrmWw&amp;index=3))\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed **Lucid Motors (**[article](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1106851_electric-car-startup-atieva-now-called-lucid-teases-first-car))\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva ([article](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15344498/lucid-formerly-known-as-atieva-will-be-the-sole-battery-pack-supplier-for-formula-e/))\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show ([video](https://abc7.com/los-angeles-auto-show-la-electric-cars-vehicles/2708944/))\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHJ17YdJC5I))\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aRbhWk99Xk))\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXbl8BS-bPE))\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) ([article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-investment-auto/saudis-pif-invests-more-than-1-billion-in-electric-carmaker-lucid-motors-idUSKCN1LX1IG), press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network ([article](https://media.electrifyamerica.com/en-us/releases/7))\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p7JD4ZYr5Q))\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory ([article](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/02/lucid-motors-breaks-ground-on-its-700-million-arizona-factory/))\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WslL6alQUns))\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem ([article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF), press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca ([article](https://www.businessinsider.com/lucid-motors-air-laguna-seca-track-tesla-model-s-plaid-2020-10))\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA ([article](https://insideevs.com/news/447170/lucid-motors-opens-beverly-hills-showroom/))\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain ([article](https://the-race.com/formula-e/powertrain-tech-supplier-picked-for-gen3-formula-e-car/))\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes CCIV rumor ([article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac))\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin ([video](https://youtu.be/yn74wHMMFJU?t=64))\n* Feb 2021 - CCIV-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds[\\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a34224854/lucid-air-with-3-electric-motors-laps-laguna-seca-in-1-31/). Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tskd0fviqbj71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c42578e4c8a298493621280e694991681d1acff7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgvh681kqbj71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f1f96594d8e8756153ff5e8321cd9dfc124a308\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)[\\*](https://youtu.be/lXD31SfCjIY?t=1326):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9nvhzlqbj71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00ec179be687a41d0716eca366479b70d21d8a38\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW[\\*](https://www.porsche.com/usa/models/taycan/taycan-models/taycan-turbo/). The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW[\\*](https://www.tesla.com/models).\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier[\\*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF). While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)[\\*](https://youtu.be/7ZkuJY1GWtE?t=312). Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells[\\*](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127084_lucid-air-electric-sedan-builds-on-company-s-formula-e-experience). This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities[\\*](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/59057/tesla-admits-full-self-driving-is-just-level-2-autonomy/). Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt4kpuhnqbj71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d23bca51b1a7bd31191cc4270a239077a7f1d393\n\n*\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*[\\*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/08/11/electric-vehicle-incentives-infrastructure/)\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built[\\*](https://carbuzz.com/news/lucids-tesla-model-x-rival-spied-completely-undisguised) using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/2p8cnvkoqbj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28d472df204c55b92cb4013316a7368eeee3bd5d)\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979[\\*](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/events/135227/alumni-spotlight-peter-rawlinson/). Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)[\\*](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-announces-senior-engineering-and-manufacturing-executives). At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production[\\*](https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-12-tesla-chief-engineer-peter-rawlinson-geeks-out-with-us-about-mod.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJrjTpWt05Qoc0TfxoaUHcwrkuS_gSqFKSazihZIDOklzMjVzPIs1E3aGOn8__QaPZu2eVu-8tU3zFZ3QtBOJIFEIDrncY-dVHQZXKMk8bRrhHzTmi5grVvvVQq_88MoyqOU3KvalEYeDoxsXz_U6oQ2FdWt06_GdSmrg3ZUXKmw). Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter[\\*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1303495330223198208?lang=en); however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/505126/elon-musk-tweet-rawlinson-not-chief-engineer/).\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021[\\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherry-house). Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo). She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally[\\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-jenkins-2016483b). Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nrw53gdrqbj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d49ffa5d1e79abecc18e979b33081b68f135347e\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com[\\*](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lucid-Motors-Reviews-E698305_P2.htm). There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year[\\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35823089/lucid-motors-ceo-defends-its-financial-practices/).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year[*\\**](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-093160/)*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4znwoc7tqbj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4616218d7ad4e82810797a004bdeb4cb078537\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life[\\*](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/). Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l4gaaciuqbj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a20d84396d5a4f18a5813ed105bcc9e8c023a7ad\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022[\\*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/saudi-backed-lucid-in-talks-for-electric-car-factory-near-jeddah) and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-20-billion-winner-of-the-american-ev-startup-boom-saudi-arabia-11626687002). If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA/financials)|18.33[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/ps_ratio)|\n|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TM/financials)|0.81[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TM/ps_ratio)|\n|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DE/XHAM/VOW/financials)|0.51[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/VWAGY/ps_ratio)|\n|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM/financials)|0.51[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/GM/ps_ratio)|\n|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NIO/financials)|12.7[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/ps_ratio)|\n|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HNDAF/financials)|0.37[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/HMC/ps_ratio)|\n|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/F/financials)|0.37[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/F/ps_ratio)|\n|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\\*|N/A *(see below)*|\n|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/XPEV/financials)|N/A|\n|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LI/financials)|N/A|\n|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/FSR/financials)|N/A|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion[\\*](https://www.calculator.net/present-value-calculator.html?c1futurevalue=22800000&amp;c1yearsv=4.25&amp;c1interestratev=10&amp;x=64&amp;y=17#future-money). *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52[\\*](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_valuation_ttm.php?ps&amp;s=1000) so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO[\\*](https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2021-05-28/electric-vehicle-firm-rivian-could-seek-70-billion-valuation-in-ipo-bloomberg-news).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nI personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.\n\n[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD \\(8\\/24\\/2021\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9beewquvqbj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16345441dbb2d7fde0b8910d1e705649bff4dbc6)\n\nFundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend ([tweet](https://twitter.com/LucidMotors/status/1429935712447565824)). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too[\\*](https://www.instagram.com/p/CS1oQTnnqzq/?hl=en).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **COMMON QUESTIONS:**\n\n**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***\n\n**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 ([page 169](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921098447/tm2123573-3_s1.htm)). Here's a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oss4my/why_pipes_wont_sell_off_all_their_lcid_shares/) thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.\n\n**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***\n\n**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however [he speculated it may be October (Q4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p9jcte/update_from_jonny_liebermans_ig_story/).\n\n**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***\n\n**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and \"near completion\"\\*.\n\n**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***\n\n**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue [here](https://cheddar.com/media/ev-maker-lucid-motors-ipo-ceo-q4-vehicle-delivery) (start at 4:00).\n\n**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (example*** [1](https://preview.redd.it/tb2p3flhvji71.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a900df13b5d4f24a1433af338cf3b7ba19091b29)***,*** [2](https://preview.redd.it/81itpelhvji71.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36e8a23399b31462f914be74fbf708d4df89d732)***,*** [3](https://preview.redd.it/qeje8har6aj71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ac773d093076d049ee46aae30516bbefe554b1)***,*** [4](https://preview.redd.it/r4jfpqus3zi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a90639a2bdc1244193db88e6b987af31583099)***)***\n\n**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers[\\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p8a5v7/beware_peter_rawlinson_is_the_last_surviving/).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **PERSONAL POSITION:**\n\nI won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like \"proof or ban\" I will happily provide screen shots privately.\n\n*^(Disclaimer: Nothing above or below constitutes professional and/or financial advice, nor does any information presented here constitute a comprehensive or complete statement of the matters discussed.

        "selftext": "\u25b6 **PRIMER:**\n\nBelow is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID (previously CCIV). I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.\n\nI'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.\n\n*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish \"DD.\" I also had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum.*\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **BACKGROUND:**\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone[\\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/stories/lucid-history).\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/456169/lucid-motors-completed-amp1-plant-capacity-stands-30000/). Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase[\\*](https://wccftech.com/lucid-group-lcid-opens-multiple-vacancies-related-to-finished-vehicles-as-the-company-moves-one-step-closer-to-initiating-deliveries/), with early construction already having begun[\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YH9m1mInVc). Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes[\\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=59).\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/517738/lucid-two-horse-race-tesla/) In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21[\\*](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33393428/lucid-air-aerodynamics-drag-coefficient-specs/), bested only by the Mercedes EQS.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds[\\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a34224854/lucid-air-with-3-electric-motors-laps-laguna-seca-in-1-31/). Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfpi4m9qbbj71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52856c525a7f880027f9510e77a7aee1dc648f7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vd3nd2nrbbj71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=452fd4594958b8fab6680b1af4fe75ce5bfad713\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I^(2)R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)[\\*](https://youtu.be/lXD31SfCjIY?t=1326):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ap0xmqhtbbj71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f09c19ff7c93fb768fd369f3ecbe57f615ff2b61\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW[\\*](https://www.porsche.com/usa/models/taycan/taycan-models/taycan-turbo/). The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW[\\*](https://www.tesla.com/models).\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier[\\*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF). While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)[\\*](https://youtu.be/7ZkuJY1GWtE?t=312). Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells[\\*](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127084_lucid-air-electric-sedan-builds-on-company-s-formula-e-experience). This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week[\\*](https://www.everydayonsales.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/KFC-Holiday-Bucket-Promo.jpg).\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform[\\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-proprietary-electric-drivetrain-technology-powers-record-setting-performance). It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance  and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities[\\*](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/59057/tesla-admits-full-self-driving-is-just-level-2-autonomy/). Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available [here](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-announces-lucid-dreamdrive).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims  being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6soi72lvbbj71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d16ba6d5a0000fd2a1006e24bbe2b20ba9d2904\n\n*\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*[\\*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/08/11/electric-vehicle-incentives-infrastructure/)\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market[\\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/future-models). Prototypes have already been built[\\*](https://carbuzz.com/news/lucids-tesla-model-x-rival-spied-completely-undisguised) using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/oos6mt21cbj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efe0279b81b7437bbf15f479d5207d7471ebeac9)\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030[\\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=62).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships[\\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=55). Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo[\\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/charging).\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979[\\*](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/events/135227/alumni-spotlight-peter-rawlinson/). Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)[\\*](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-announces-senior-engineering-and-manufacturing-executives). At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production[\\*](https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-12-tesla-chief-engineer-peter-rawlinson-geeks-out-with-us-about-mod.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJrjTpWt05Qoc0TfxoaUHcwrkuS_gSqFKSazihZIDOklzMjVzPIs1E3aGOn8__QaPZu2eVu-8tU3zFZ3QtBOJIFEIDrncY-dVHQZXKMk8bRrhHzTmi5grVvvVQq_88MoyqOU3KvalEYeDoxsXz_U6oQ2FdWt06_GdSmrg3ZUXKmw). Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019[\\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-appoints-peter-rawlinson-ceo). Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter[\\*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1303495330223198208?lang=en); however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted[\\*](https://insideevs.com/news/505126/elon-musk-tweet-rawlinson-not-chief-engineer/).\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021[\\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherry-house). Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo). She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy[\\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/leadership/derek-jenkins). Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally[\\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-jenkins-2016483b). Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors[\\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/leadership/eric-bach). At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1gyssq3cbj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f17b6ef09e7acbb2e43a888a32674557771273ad\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com[\\*](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lucid-Motors-Reviews-E698305_P2.htm). There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly[\\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/careers/search/), expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year[\\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35823089/lucid-motors-ceo-defends-its-financial-practices/).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020 ([graph](https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cars-vs-evs-per-1000-people.jpg))[\\*](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/lcid-stock-trust-historical-trends/). This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*[*\\**](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/3872fdce-91c5-468b-a127-c2b598bd8691)*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year*[*\\**](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-093160/)*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026[\\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=65). Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**[\\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=66).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vyugzv5cbj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=981e2a2ab4cc0927ea11e5493582624a377cdf24\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California[\\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=39).  They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life[\\*](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/). Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n[Lucid Energy Storage System \\(ESS\\)](https://preview.redd.it/343itvu7cbj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7db0bff3d1f59892252edf8ced60b3c029b1b6c)\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022[\\*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/saudi-backed-lucid-in-talks-for-electric-car-factory-near-jeddah) and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-20-billion-winner-of-the-american-ev-startup-boom-saudi-arabia-11626687002). If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA/financials)|18.33[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/ps_ratio)|\n|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TM/financials)|0.81[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TM/ps_ratio)|\n|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DE/XHAM/VOW/financials)|0.51[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/VWAGY/ps_ratio)|\n|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM/financials)|0.51[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/GM/ps_ratio)|\n|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NIO/financials)|12.7[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/ps_ratio)|\n|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HNDAF/financials)|0.37[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/HMC/ps_ratio)|\n|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/F/financials)|0.37[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/F/ps_ratio)|\n|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\\*|N/A *(see below)*|\n|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/XPEV/financials)|N/A|\n|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LI/financials)|N/A|\n|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/FSR/financials)|N/A|\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026[\\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=65). *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion[\\*](https://www.calculator.net/present-value-calculator.html?c1futurevalue=22800000&amp;c1yearsv=4.25&amp;c1interestratev=10&amp;x=64&amp;y=17#future-money). *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52[\\*](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_valuation_ttm.php?ps&amp;s=1000) so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO[\\*](https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2021-05-28/electric-vehicle-firm-rivian-could-seek-70-billion-valuation-in-ipo-bloomberg-news).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nI personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.\n\n[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD \\(8\\/24\\/2021\\)](https://preview.redd.it/24wlugi9cbj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2be0c984b4eaf528ba624b808170b4b39e5bd80a)\n\nFundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend ([tweet](https://twitter.com/LucidMotors/status/1429935712447565824)). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too[\\*](https://www.instagram.com/p/CS1oQTnnqzq/?hl=en).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **COMMON QUESTIONS:**\n\n**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***\n\n**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 ([page 169](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921098447/tm2123573-3_s1.htm)). Here's a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oss4my/why_pipes_wont_sell_off_all_their_lcid_shares/) thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.\n\n**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***\n\n**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however [he speculated it may be October (Q4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p9jcte/update_from_jonny_liebermans_ig_story/).\n\n**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***\n\n**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and \"near completion\"[\\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=8).\n\n**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***\n\n**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue [here](https://cheddar.com/media/ev-maker-lucid-motors-ipo-ceo-q4-vehicle-delivery) (start at 4:00).\n\n**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (example*** [1](https://preview.redd.it/tb2p3flhvji71.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a900df13b5d4f24a1433af338cf3b7ba19091b29)***,*** [2](https://preview.redd.it/81itpelhvji71.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36e8a23399b31462f914be74fbf708d4df89d732)***,*** [3](https://preview.redd.it/qeje8har6aj71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ac773d093076d049ee46aae30516bbefe554b1)***,*** [4](https://preview.redd.it/r4jfpqus3zi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a90639a2bdc1244193db88e6b987af31583099)***)***\n\n**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021).  Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers[\\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p8a5v7/beware_peter_rawlinson_is_the_last_surviving/).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **PERSONAL POSITION:**\n\nI won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like \"proof or ban\" I will happily provide screen shots privately.\n\n*^(Disclaimer: Nothing above or below constitutes professional and/or financial advice, nor does any information presented here constitute a comprehensive or complete statement of the matters discussed.

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/goodbye-summer-hello-all-time-high?justPublished=true).\n\n**TLDR:** Stock market news sentiment was significantly bullish (ie. optimistic into the future) driven by new all-time high S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ prices, Bitcoin eclipsing $50K benchmark, and regarding upcoming economic data to be released (jobs, housing, manufacturing reports next week). \n\n \n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news bounced back towards significantly bullish sentiment, with the average article recording an optimistic 0.30 sentiment score (which is *double* the average sentiment score posted last week) and impressive 0.67 time-sense score; this means approximately one third of all sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically, and an overlapping two thirds of all sentences were written in future-tense. **Both scores add up to indicate that market conversation remains highly bullish, expressing high degrees of optimism about the future.** \n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\n*Each week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency.

($AAPL)**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)**: The most-mentioned ticker in stock market news coverage this week was $AAPL.** The company\u2019s stock finished the week at $148.60 per share, and showed moderate optimism expressed in news sentiment. Many of Apple\u2019s headlines this week centered on CEO Tim Cook as he celebrated his 10-year anniversary in the pilot\u2019s chair \u2014 per his contract with the company, he received 5-million shares of $AAPL stock this week to the tune of $750M, according to SEC filings. His influence on the company\u2019s trajectory over the past decade has been undeniable, as he is now responsible for creating more shareholder value than any CEO *ever* ( ($2.1 trillion dollars, shown [here](http://%20%28%242.1%20trillion%20dollars%29/)). Other headlines from Apple came this week in the form of Warren Buffett wisdom, as the billionaire Berkshire CEO stated he\u2019d be adding more shares of $AAPL to his portfolio as a hedge against rising inflation. Buffett \u2014 who himself ranks #7 on the list of all-time shareholder value produced \u2014 has been a long-time proponent of Apple, and [argues](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-according-161829003.html) that now is a better time than ever to be purchasing the stock.

The bitcoin-mining company posted a quarterly earnings-per-share of $0.22, broadly eclipsing its consensus analyst estimates of $0.02 and signaling immense improvement from its -$0.31 EPS loss posted a year ago. In the report, Riot reported Bitcoin mining revenues exceeding $31M, an astounding 1540% increase from last year, coupled with 70% increase in its mining revenue margins. The company attributed much of its mining capacity growth to its successful acquisition of Whinstone (an infrastructure provider), and to significant efforts related to de-risking its operational structure. With such encouraging numbers to report and with Bitcoin\u2019s price re-eclipsing the $50K benchmark, $RIOT stock price grew 5.17% to $38.57 per share \u2014 a 1,007% increase in price from the same time last year.

In their quarterly report, Best Buy announced earnings a sales increase of 20% over the past 90-days, exceeding the forecast of 17% set by management in their previous report. The consumer electronics retailer attributed much of this growth to charging higher prices for products across their computing and premium home appliance segments, citing heightened demand for technology upgrades as people are beginning to permanently embrace habits like working from home and streaming TV. The ability to raise their margins across segments has boded well, allowing the company to achieve its highest profitability rate ever of more than 6% operating margins (see [chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/9d766a7052b6ce9fca69af524780fd8c.png)). This renewed reassurance of strong business growth after a string of week quarters financially has raised eyebrows across Wall Street, with the likes of Jim Cramer saying that Best Buy\u2019s turnaround brings broader implications to the e-commerce landscape: \u201cBest Buy\u2019s basically replacing corporate tech support for remote works\u201d.

Despite $CE stock bouncing back this period up 3.4% to $160.25 per share, the company saw more pessimism expressed in news articles than any other ticker this week, driven by a string of negatively connotated articles written in responses to poor performance over the previous week (during which the company\u2019s stock price fell for six consecutive days to more than 10% below its 52-week high from May). The company also announced this week that it would be offering up to \u20ac 300M towards the purchase of its outstanding 1.125% senior notes due in 2023. Compared to close competitors like Exxon Mobile Corp. ($XOM) and Eastman Chemical Co.($EMN), Celanese has underperformed its peers over the last 30 days as the earnings fervor subdues. Despite the downward trajectory of the recent months, many analysts argue that the company could remain a reliable long-term hold due to its consistent earnings and dividends.

The company \u2014 which specializes in high-complexity pharmaceutical information services for cancer genetics diagnostic testing \u2014 has been one of the more volatile stocks on the market in recent months, as investors have shown increased interest in unproven biomedical companies of the like. While some analysts contend that such companies are worth a gamble for their potential to achieve huge profitability in a blossoming healthcare sector, others say that $NEO\u2019s balance sheet signals undue risk of permanent losses for investors. One major red flag is the company\u2019s seeming incapability of paying its lenders, as it currently sits on a thrown of more than $533.4M worth of debt (an increase of $170.9M over the previous year). While NeoGenomics reported more than $571.7M in cash during its most recent earnings report, the runway toward achieving substantial profitability is finite. The question: can the company find consistent revenues before its debt burden grows unbearable?

The move also signals the company\u2019s willingness to embrace collaboration-centric software, a trend we\u2019ve seen across many SaaS companies catalyzed by the COVID-19 work-from-home movement.

Biggest Changes in Sentiment\n\n\ud83d\udcb1\u00a0**Cardano ($ADA) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week.** The alt-coin, which now boasts the third-highest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, made waves in news coverage this week after eclipsing the $2.00 price benchmark last week and reaching a new all-time high price of $2.39 on Wednesday on the back of [comments](https://ambcrypto.com/hoskinson-says-cardano-is-on-a-different-path-than-ethereum-bitcoin/) from its outspoken founder Charles Hoskinson.\n\n\ud83d\udc8a\u00a0**CVS Health ($CVS) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week** after announcing that it would be limiting purchases of over-the-counter rapid COVID-19 tests in the coming weeks due to excess demand. While this news draws questions about the robustness of CVS\u2019s supply chain, the main takeaway seems to be its implications about the current severity of the pandemic. Accordingly, $CVS stock price fell 1.97% on the week.\n\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\u00a0**ContextLogic Inc. ($WISH) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last.** This comes a week after $WISH stock fell 9% on disappointing Q2 earnings. Throughout this week, the stock rallied back more than 5% to $6.94 on heavy volume from retail traders on r/WallStreetBets and the like, leaving [analysts](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/wish-stock-is-worth-sticking-with-even-after-its-dismal-earnings-report/) to wonder if the stock is worth sticking around for. Other highly speculative tickers in news this week include Intel ($INTC), Peloton ($PTON), Skyworks ($SKWS), and Applied Materials ($AMAT).\n\n\u2615\u00a0**Starbucks Inc. ($SBUX) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed** driven by a multitude of articles written about its recent ability to capture consumer trends as a business \u2014 including this [piece](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/25/3-reasons-why-starbucks-could-win-as-students-retu/) which anticipates a bump in sales as college students return to in-person classes, and [social media buzz](https://twitter.com/uDontKnoDietz/status/1430589780799234059?s=20) driven by its early introduction of pumpkin spice-themed drinks -(before Labor Day? is that legal?). Other highly reactive tickers this week include Boeing ($BA), Walmart ($WMT), Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ), and IBM ($IBM).\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news saw another boost in optimism back to its recent high levels as the markets peaked above new all-time high price points. Speculation in the news remains abound as we wrap up the month of August and transition into the final months of 2021. **While stocks have performed well in recent weeks on top of outstanding earnings reports across the board, inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty remain top of mind.**\n\nWe said it last week and we\u2019ll say it again: the heightened optimism in the news is a reassuring hand in today\u2019s market, but a signifcant shift in mood or economic catalysts (or some combination of the two, realistically) have the potential to bring the market back down to Earth. We will look ahead to vital economic reports (and their reactions) this week, including: housing data to be released Tuesday, manufacturing and service economy trends to be released Wednesday and Friday, and August\u2019s monthly job report due Friday.\n\nWith this in mind, good luck to all in this final week of trading before Labor Day. Stay tuned later this week for an extra newsletter about what we are reading heading into this Fall, and some in-depth analysis about what we saw in the news over the month of August. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

        "selftext": "Today we are analyzing the chipmaker's share, which sank -13% over the past week. How relevant is it to buy a company now and what are the prospects for the business? Let's watch. \n\n1) \ud83d\udd25Multipliers:\nP / E: 19.21\nP / S: 3.11\nRO\u0410: 7.38%\nROE: 9.78%\n\n\u25ab\ufe0fComment: Multipliers remain at acceptable levels and the stock is one of the cheapest in the entire sector. It is important to note the decline in business profitability in the last 2-3 years. In terms of EV/EBITDA, the company is the least overbought among all AMD $AMD, Nvidia $NVDA and Qualcomm $QCOM peers.\n\n2) \ud83d\udd25Business structure and fundamentals:\n\n \u25aa\ufe0fWe look at financial indicators. Pure Growth stock. Revenues and profits over the past 10 years are impressive, but there is a turning point in 2017-2018, from there stagnation began. Earnings per share (EPS) is at an acceptable level of $3.68. Net profitability fell to 16.2% The company has a low debt burden: the debt/equity ratio is less than 20%. Net debt is negative, but unfortunately it won't last long! The company is now increasing capital expenditures. Also in America is actively being stimulated the semiconductor industry as one of the growth drivers of the entire economy, but there is still not enough capacity to meet demand. Micron's manufacturing inventories were down 8.9% quarter-on-quarter.\n\n \u25aa\ufe0fNow there is an obvious shortage of semiconductors all over the world. Apple $AAPL, Volkswagen $VOW and others cannot increase production without additional components. The decision of Micron to sell one of the factories remains unclear. The deal was valued at $1.5 billion, of which only $900 million was in cash. Intel $INTC and Taiwan Semiconductor $TSM will build 2 plants over several years, expanding market share in the long term. According to Bloomberg forecasts, the chip market will grow by 7-8% yoy. More questions than answers...\n\n\n 3) \ud83d\udd25 Company's report\n\n \u25ab\ufe0fLet's go over specific numbers.  Micron's quarterly revenue rose by 38% to $7.42 billion from $5.44 billion. Revenue for 2021 increased by +27.3% to $19.431 billion against $15.38 billion a year earlier. Net income for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2021 was $3.141 billion, an increase of +82.6% over 2020.\n\n \u25ab\ufe0fBut the forecasts of the company are much more important. For the forthcoming 4th quarter, the company forecasts earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $2.2-2.4 and revenues of ~$8 billion. In the long term (next 4-5 years) EPS is expected to increase ~ +61% yoy.\n\n \ud83c\udfc6Conclusion by company:\n\nThe stock breaks through one by one support levels, the previous one was at around $76.5. The stock is currently trading at $70-71. The cheapest and most promising company in the sector with a huge queue of buyers. And Morgan Stanley $MS decides to revise its goals and forecasts for the company. This is how Wall Street inside information works.\nAlready on the horizon of several months, the company has excellent prospects, so I keep the shares in the portfolio! I would like to increase the share even if they give a little lower.\n\n\ud83d\udd25What to do if you\n1) \u265fSpeculator: not your paper!  For you, papers in an uptrend are more suitable. For example Qualcomm, Square $SQ or Nvidia $NVDA.\n2) \u265fMedium-term investor: be sure to add the company to the watch list and take a closer look at it! As reports are released, there are many opportunities in the marketplace. \n3) \u265fLong-term investor: You can put a notification at $60-65 and take a closer look at the stock on the market correction. For now, you should focus on increasing your cash position. I would like to buy Taiwan Semiconductor, but still wait for it below to enter.\n\nIf you like my analysis of $MU, press upvote!",

        "selftext": "\u25b6 **PRIMER:**\n\nBelow is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID (previously CCIV). I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.\n\nI'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.\n\n*EDIT: I had to trim down a lot of content to keep it under the 40k character maximum. Nearly all outside links have been removed to appease the WSB automoderator. Random asterisks without a link were previously outside resources. You may be able to find this DD elsewhere with the links intact.*\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **BACKGROUND:**\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun[\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YH9m1mInVc). Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82bg8c14dcj71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79cc750bf9da7c90c2c3a6d4ba1338d8ddccb996\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** ([picture version](https://i.redd.it/uf2s1rfsyfe71.png)):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQn9DLOQWZg&amp;list=TLPQMzEwNzIwMjHrU1pRCKrmWw&amp;index=3))\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed **Lucid Motors (**article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHJ17YdJC5I))\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aRbhWk99Xk))\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXbl8BS-bPE))\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) ([article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-investment-auto/saudis-pif-invests-more-than-1-billion-in-electric-carmaker-lucid-motors-idUSKCN1LX1IG), press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p7JD4ZYr5Q))\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WslL6alQUns))\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem ([article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF), press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes CCIV rumor ([article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac))\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin ([video](https://youtu.be/yn74wHMMFJU?t=64))\n* Feb 2021 - CCIV-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwv11ar6dcj71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d484a2a024b7da9b48e267d832024612cbde78b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5u9o5q38dcj71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=784ee9a050d634d3820ca3e2989ba8c8ef3f946b\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)[\\*](https://youtu.be/lXD31SfCjIY?t=1326):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0grqw87bdcj71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f013e50cc5df4986a11d1553522d2f51905381\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier[\\*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF). While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)[\\*](https://youtu.be/7ZkuJY1GWtE?t=312). Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltntdlhddcj71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ce6c8cbf8fff24026a918b212acc806d348b440\n\n*\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*[\\*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/08/11/electric-vehicle-incentives-infrastructure/)\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built[\\*](https://carbuzz.com/news/lucids-tesla-model-x-rival-spied-completely-undisguised) using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/7h6s2zmedcj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=410a380999034d8fb869c5c0718e2caa02eb6e9b)\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production[\\*](https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-12-tesla-chief-engineer-peter-rawlinson-geeks-out-with-us-about-mod.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJrjTpWt05Qoc0TfxoaUHcwrkuS_gSqFKSazihZIDOklzMjVzPIs1E3aGOn8__QaPZu2eVu-8tU3zFZ3QtBOJIFEIDrncY-dVHQZXKMk8bRrhHzTmi5grVvvVQq_88MoyqOU3KvalEYeDoxsXz_U6oQ2FdWt06_GdSmrg3ZUXKmw). Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter[\\*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1303495330223198208?lang=en); however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally[\\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-jenkins-2016483b). Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xnn7lpgdcj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1b04418810e65d0bcc1ed3bd762a6c022de8546\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com[\\*](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lucid-Motors-Reviews-E698305_P2.htm). There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year[\\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35823089/lucid-motors-ceo-defends-its-financial-practices/).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year[*\\**](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-093160/)*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4hhmn9kdcj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52a931691b03d3a7048f5f8f27d6c9457434375b\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9coowmldcj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8e84e345507a0eb2c999bece3b72aea284e2de3\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-20-billion-winner-of-the-american-ev-startup-boom-saudi-arabia-11626687002). If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA/financials)|18.33[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/ps_ratio)|\n|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TM/financials)|0.81[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TM/ps_ratio)|\n|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DE/XHAM/VOW/financials)|0.51[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/VWAGY/ps_ratio)|\n|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM/financials)|0.51[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/GM/ps_ratio)|\n|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NIO/financials)|12.7[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/ps_ratio)|\n|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HNDAF/financials)|0.37[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/HMC/ps_ratio)|\n|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/F/financials)|0.37[\\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/F/ps_ratio)|\n|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\\*|N/A *(see below)*|\n|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/XPEV/financials)|N/A|\n|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LI/financials)|N/A|\n|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)[\\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/FSR/financials)|N/A|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion[\\*](https://www.calculator.net/present-value-calculator.html?c1futurevalue=22800000&amp;c1yearsv=4.25&amp;c1interestratev=10&amp;x=64&amp;y=17#future-money). *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nI personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.\n\n[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/dop5nn3ndcj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b168db43106a6c4918f0fff1b9545501b35eaa6)\n\nFundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend ([tweet](https://twitter.com/LucidMotors/status/1429935712447565824)). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too[\\*](https://www.instagram.com/p/CS1oQTnnqzq/?hl=en).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **COMMON QUESTIONS:**\n\n**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***\n\n**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 ([page 169](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921098447/tm2123573-3_s1.htm)). Here's a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oss4my/why_pipes_wont_sell_off_all_their_lcid_shares/) thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.\n\n**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***\n\n**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however [he speculated it may be October (Q4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p9jcte/update_from_jonny_liebermans_ig_story/).\n\n**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***\n\n**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and \"near completion\"\\*.\n\n**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***\n\n**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required.

I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment.

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/goodbye-summer-hello-all-time-high?justPublished=true).\n\n**TLDR:** Stock market news sentiment was significantly bullish (ie. optimistic into the future) driven by new all-time high S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ prices, B!tcoin eclipsing $50K benchmark, and regarding upcoming economic data to be released (jobs, housing, manufacturing reports next week).\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news bounced back towards significantly bullish sentiment, with the average article recording an optimistic 0.30 sentiment score (which is *double* the average sentiment score posted last week) and impressive 0.67 time-sense score; this means approximately one third of all sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically, and an overlapping two thirds of all sentences were written in future-tense. **Both scores add up to indicate that market conversation remains highly bullish, expressing high degrees of optimism about the future.** \n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\n*Each week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here:* [Most Mentioned Tickers Table 8/23-8/27](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4eeaf148-8cef-437e-b7fa-a4e10af08411_1231x1169.jpeg)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e\u00a0[**Apple Inc. ($AAPL)**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)**: The most-mentioned ticker in stock market news coverage this week was $AAPL.** The company\u2019s stock finished the week at $148.60 per share, and showed moderate optimism expressed in news sentiment. Many of Apple\u2019s headlines this week centered on CEO Tim Cook as he celebrated his 10-year anniversary in the pilot\u2019s chair \u2014 per his contract with the company, he received 5-million shares of $AAPL stock this week to the tune of $750M, according to SEC filings. His influence on the company\u2019s trajectory over the past decade has been undeniable, as he is now responsible for creating more shareholder value than any CEO *ever* ( ($2.1 trillion dollars, shown [here](http://%20%28%242.1%20trillion%20dollars%29/)). Other headlines from Apple came this week in the form of Warren Buffett wisdom, as the billionaire Berkshire CEO stated he\u2019d be adding more shares of $AAPL to his portfolio as a hedge against rising inflation. Buffett \u2014 who himself ranks #7 on the list of all-time shareholder value produced \u2014 has been a long-time proponent of Apple, and [argues](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-according-161829003.html) that now is a better time than ever to be purchasing the stock.

($RIOT)**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIOT/)**: Riot Blockchain saw this week\u2019s biggest increase in news headlines compared to last week** after announcing its Q2 earnings report on Monday; average news sentiment expressed was moderately optimistic with a score of 0.32. The B!tcoin-mining company posted a quarterly earnings-per-share of $0.22, broadly eclipsing its consensus analyst estimates of $0.02 and signaling immense improvement from its -$0.31 EPS loss posted a year ago. In the report, Riot reported B!tcoin-mining revenues exceeding $31M, an astounding 1540% increase from last year, coupled with 70% increase in its mining revenue margins. The company attributed much of its mining capacity growth to its successful acquisition of Whinstone (an infrastructure provider), and to significant efforts related to de-risking its operational structure. With such encouraging numbers to report and with B!tcoin\u2019s price re-eclipsing the $50K benchmark, $RIOT stock price grew 5.17% to $38.57 per share \u2014 a 1,007% increase in price from the same time last year.

Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\n*Each week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. By our analysis, here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in last week\u2019s news:* [Ticker News Sentiment Chart 8/23-8/27](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed7ae131-4122-42a1-a212-303c0b9ce81a_2166x1290.png)\n\n\ud83c\udfec [**Best Buy Inc. ($BBY):**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/)\u00a0**This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Best Buy** ***(optimism score: 59.7%).***\u00a0$BBY stock rose 3.98% to end the week back above its $115 price level after the company released Q2 earnings on Tuesday. In their quarterly report, Best Buy announced earnings a sales increase of 20% over the past 90-days, exceeding the forecast of 17% set by management in their previous report. The consumer electronics retailer attributed much of this growth to charging higher prices for products across their computing and premium home appliance segments, citing heightened demand for technology upgrades as people are beginning to permanently embrace habits like working from home and streaming TV. The ability to raise their margins across segments has boded well, allowing the company to achieve its highest profitability rate ever of more than 6% operating margins (see [chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/9d766a7052b6ce9fca69af524780fd8c.png)). This renewed reassurance of strong business growth after a string of week quarters financially has raised eyebrows across Wall Street, with the likes of Jim Cramer saying that Best Buy\u2019s turnaround brings broader implications to the e-commerce landscape: \u201cBest Buy\u2019s basically replacing corporate tech support for remote works\u201d. This week\u2019s most optimistic $BBY news article:\n\n&gt;*\u201cBest Buy Shares Rise on Earnings Beat, Retailer says Consumers are Upgrading Tech to Work at Home\u201d*\u00a0|\u00a0[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/best-buy-bby-earnings-q2-2022.html)\n\n\ud83c\udfed [**Celanese Corp ($CE):**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CE/)\u00a0**This week\u2019s most pessimistic stock in news coverage was Celanese*****(pessimism score: 47.6%).***\u00a0It should be noted that Celenese \u2014 a global hybrid chemical company based in Irving, Texas \u2014 was also the most speculative stock in news coverage three weeks ago, after the company announced a significant beat of its Q2 earnings estimates; since then the stock has moved steadily downhill for the most part. Despite $CE stock bouncing back this period up 3.4% to $160.25 per share, the company saw more pessimism expressed in news articles than any other ticker this week, driven by a string of negatively connotated articles written in responses to poor performance over the previous week (during which the company\u2019s stock price fell for six consecutive days to more than 10% below its 52-week high from May). The company also announced this week that it would be offering up to \u20ac 300M towards the purchase of its outstanding 1.125% senior notes due in 2023. Compared to close competitors like Exxon Mobile Corp. ($XOM) and Eastman Chemical Co.($EMN), Celanese has underperformed its peers over the last 30 days as the earnings fervor subdues. Despite the downward trajectory of the recent months, many analysts argue that the company could remain a reliable long-term hold due to its consistent earnings and dividends.

Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in eah of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last.* [Biggest Ticker Sentiment Changes 8/23-8/27](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e21704-47a6-4aee-aa44-ce645b144302_1899x756.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcb1\u00a0**Cardano ($ADA) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week.** The alt-coin, which now boasts the third-highest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, made waves in news coverage this week after eclipsing the $2.00 price benchmark last week and reaching a new all-time high price of $2.39 on Wednesday on the back of [comments](https://ambcrypto.com/hoskinson-says-cardano-is-on-a-different-path-than-ethereum-bitcoin/) from its outspoken founder Charles Hoskinson.\n\n\ud83d\udc8a\u00a0**CVS Health ($CVS) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week** after announcing that it would be limiting purchases of over-the-counter rapid COVID-19 tests in the coming weeks due to excess demand. While this news draws questions about the robustness of CVS\u2019s supply chain, the main takeaway seems to be its implications about the current severity of the pandemic. Accordingly, $CVS stock price fell 1.97% on the week.\n\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\u00a0**ContextLogic Inc. ($WISH) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last.** This comes a week after $WISH stock fell 9% on disappointing Q2 earnings. Throughout this week, the stock rallied back more than 5% to $6.94 on heavy volume from retail traders on r/WallStreetBets and the like, leaving [analysts](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/wish-stock-is-worth-sticking-with-even-after-its-dismal-earnings-report/) to wonder if the stock is worth sticking around for. Other highly speculative tickers in news this week include Intel ($INTC), Peloton ($PTON), Skyworks ($SKWS), and Applied Materials ($AMAT).\n\n\u2615\u00a0**Starbucks Inc. ($SBUX) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed** driven by a multitude of articles written about its recent ability to capture consumer trends as a business \u2014 including this [piece](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/25/3-reasons-why-starbucks-could-win-as-students-retu/) which anticipates a bump in sales as college students return to in-person classes, and [social media buzz](https://twitter.com/uDontKnoDietz/status/1430589780799234059?s=20) driven by its early introduction of pumpkin spice-themed drinks -(before Labor Day? is that legal?). Other highly reactive tickers this week include Boeing ($BA), Walmart ($WMT), Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ), and IBM ($IBM).\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news saw another boost in optimism back to its recent high levels as the markets peaked above new all-time high price points. Speculation in the news remains abound as we wrap up the month of August and transition into the final months of 2021. **While stocks have performed well in recent weeks on top of outstanding earnings reports across the board, inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty remain top of mind.**\n\nWe said it last week and we\u2019ll say it again: the heightened optimism in the news is a reassuring hand in today\u2019s market, but a signifcant shift in mood or economic catalysts (or some combination of the two, realistically) have the potential to bring the market back down to Earth. We will look ahead to vital economic reports (and their reactions) this week, including: housing data to be released Tuesday, manufacturing and service economy trends to be released Wednesday and Friday, and August\u2019s monthly job report due Friday.\n\nWith this in mind, good luck to all in this final week of trading before Labor Day. Stay tuned later this week for an extra newsletter about what we are reading heading into this Fall, and some in-depth analysis about what we saw in the news over the month of August. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 24, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their strong performance, recovering from jitteriness last week to reach new intraday record highs in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ). The Dow Jones (DIA) traded modestly even and remains roughly $2 from its record high. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued rallying after steeply underperforming last week, climbing roughly 3% in the last two days. After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give his annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\nKeith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist at Truist Financial, gave this take about earnings, \u201cWe think the primary trend is higher. We\u2019re only about one year into this economic expansion. Expansions typically last about five years, And the earnings season which we just got out of was phenomenal. Even if it\u2019s peak growth, we still think it\u2019s going to be strong growth. You have earnings moving forward and then you look at the relative comparison of stocks relative to bonds and they\u2019re still attractive. Overall, we think the right position is to be overweight stocks.\u201d\n\nUS Crude oil prices gained for a second straight session, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.\n\nEnergy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of \u201cmeme stocks\u201d like AMC and Gamestop (GME) and others had a great day today, building on advances in recent sessions. \n* Shares of travel and leisure companies are rebounding following the FDA\u2019s full approval of their coronavirus vaccine, which hopefully encourages more vaccinations and allows the country to reopen faster\n* Shares of Airbnb (ABNB) gapped up more than 8% amid this broader rebound by travel and leisure stocks\n* According to the Department of Commerce, sales of new homes unexpectedly rose in July, suggesting some firming up in housing market activity amid high prices and low inventory. New home sales increased 1.0% in July compared to June, bringing sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000. Consensus economists were looking for a rate of 697,000 homes. Sales in June were also upwardly revised to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 701,000, from the 676,000 previously reported. \n* Shares of Chinese companies rebounded somewhat following an intense sell-off amid regulatory pressure from the government. \n* Shares of Peloton (PTON) rose after the company announced it was restarting sales of its treadmill following a recall earlier in the year \n* Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) self-driving spin-off Waymo is starting testing in San Francisco with the aim to start a robotaxi service within the next 3 years.\n* The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Barclays from $340 to $370 at Overweight.

The Volvo Group is widely regarded as one of the best car manufacturers in the world for its reputation for safety. As a result, Volvo is gaining momentum within the automotive industry in terms of its consumer division vehicles. Volvo is increasing its auto sales in all geographies. In 2021, it is one of the fastest growing automakers gaining market share in two of the world's largest markets (the US and China). Since they use QNX in their truck line, any future positive experiences with the software could once again draw Volvo's attention to bring QNX to their consumer car division. BlackBerry could play a role in the positive side of Volvo's growth going forward. If Volvo were to bring QNX to its consumer car division, more automakers are likely to follow Volvo's lead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnical aspects\n\n good view in tf of an hour. . clearly, maintaining a trend reversal behavior. .lateralizing, but, beginning to leave increasing lows. .

        "selftext": "Hey all, I\u2019m just some tech nerd who likes to dabble in investing and \"investing.\" However, there is a company that I\u2019m interacting with that, frankly, I\u2019m surprised hasn\u2019t blown up higher than they are. Figured I\u2019d share it on a much more popular place, because I think it deserves a little love.\u00a0\n\nAmbarella ($AMBA) is a somewhat small (3.4B market cap as of writing this) semiconductor company that seems to be very focused on creating the best computer vision processors out there. They also make really good, normal application processors that have fantastic video processing capabilities. I've gotten my hands on them a bit, not as much as I would like, but I see some promise in their new stuff and think they're undervalued.\u00a0\n\n# Competition:\n\nBasically if you think of AI vision processing you probably have the one behemoth in mind: Nvidia. How the hell is this company that's worth 1/200th of Nvidia going to compete? Well it comes down to architecture. Nvidia slams the same design from their top end A series card to their lowest end GPU, designed for hardcore parallel processing like you would expect a GPU to be. This works for sure, but it is inefficient for pure vision processing, compared to a purpose built processor. Ambarella can do stereoscopic vision processing in their highest end processor in a silicon die that's probably at least 5x smaller than Nvidia's highest end processor, at likely significantly less cost too. That's a big deal for both power efficiency, and pure cost.\u00a0\n\nAMBA is also one of two companies that has an AI vision and video processing API with AWS. I bet you can guess the other one. That's great for developers to get used to the ecosystem, and easy access to new talent that may be able to bring their employer in.\u00a0\n\nI am unaware of any other company that has nearly the level of ability in their processors for computer vision. With the constant increase of self driving startups out there, I can only imagine that AMBA playing at the top of the field alone will be huge, as not every single company can afford hundreds of millions to design their own silicon, like Tesla did after moving away from NVDA.\u00a0\n\n# Catalysts:\n\nAMBA is holding their earnings one week from now, August 31st. This will be the first earnings that they are going to have been working with ARVL and KeepTruckin. KeepTruckin handles 90,000 drivers in the US currently, and ARVL has at least 10k sales planned in the future. I\u2019ll let those people talk more about what\u2019s going on there, I\u2019m not up to date with the car manufacturer space and I\u2019m pretty sure that they were a meme stock at some point, so they\u2019ll probably go crazy talking about all their sales that I\u2019m hoping they get.\u00a0\n\nHaving more customers as a semiconductor company creating products on high end process nodes is *basically free* when you\u2019re running in lower quantities. Why? How? Well it just comes down to the massive non-recurring costs in semiconductor manufacturing. This is something the semiconductor people know well, but I\u2019ll give a rough outline for those of you not in the know. Manufacturing silicon on the most cutting edge nodes is insanely expensive, even if you\u2019re just wanting to produce one single die, you\u2019re spending tens, or hundreds of millions of dollars just to make the patterns to make your chip. For TSMC 7nm it\u2019s likely in the hundred to hundreds of millions of dollars that you have to spend once. Every single wafer you buy gets made with those patterns. Each wafer costs money of course, but each one pales in comparison to the amount you spend in the actual photomasks to make your chips.\n\nIf they end up selling more chips, the NR costs get spread out over more, allowing either more competitive pricing if they want, or just more profit. With what is probably 100k of their top end chip sales public, that's a big deal for AMBA as each of their chips costs probably ~$50 to make, and probably sells for significant multiples of that. They are also definitely selling many more than that in more low-end devices like security cameras and action cameras, but that's not the high end flashy cool tech so I'm not gonna bore everyone with that.\u00a0\n\n# Future: \n\nThis is more of a \"what I see and what I want\" kinda section. I'm very much an outsider, and it's very hard to get any word from the company, so everything here should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nI can definitely see AMBA upping their software friendliness and taking a page out of Nvidia's book and making a Jetson competitor. As I said in the title, they're a very quiet company. I would have never heard about them had I not been working with building software for action cameras. Getting their products and software into the hands of real developers to create products with their chips, regardless of if they sell 100 or 100k would be good for sales directly, and massive for brand recognition. AMBA is competing directly with custom silicon, like what's in Tesla, Waymo in my opinion, and if they can get a good enough product that it's worth these big companies not spending hundreds of millions to make their own silicon and instead just using the CV2 processor or whatever comes next, that's be great. I'm seeing the same thing that happened way back in the 90s with companies that had their own custom processors just moving to Intel or AMD because it just didn't make sense to spend the money designing and building their own processor when they could just use someone else's. If AMBA could become the Intel or AMD of computer vision, that's be pretty huge. \n\n## Position and plan\n\nWhat am I planning on doing? Well, hodling my 100 shares. I\u2019m no rich man, and frankly although I think this earnings will be fantastic, good news isn\u2019t always correlated with good stock price. So dumb shares it is, no options or anything.\u00a0\n\n[Position](https://i.imgur.com/DAJahVj.jpg)",

I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.\n\nI'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.\n\n*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish \"DD.\" I had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum.* ***I've removed all links*** *to appease the WSB automoderator which doesn't seem to want to let anything through. Random asterisks and parentheticals were previously outside resources.*\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **BACKGROUND:**\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q60z0rxqhcj71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a64c6669242682bf8d768ffd28c24867ec8b76bf\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed **Lucid Motors (**article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes CCIV rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - CCIV-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqyat48thcj71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e777cf404bb900f0ea72081ca2fe08ad5d5e1fab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yw9q2cauhcj71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26841b8cbf5b93ef1166711e61011401839ebea3\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\n*Processing img w3pz79awhcj71...*\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pwq7jufyhcj71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9edfd8432abdaefbc9692ac240e13651713c38a\n\n*\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/2v9348xzhcj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad772cbf2f282fd9524cbf102e280ea257268167)\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/1vdi4222icj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a88ff49dfd3025c8568497b09324f7dee82eb6f4)\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year*\\***. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x98dwek4icj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc51fa324986831011a87c2cd050e09e49b9175\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krresuu5icj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbde14fbfe753a1a8a4b7e62a0c92c6c0722e11f\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*|18.33\\*|\n|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*|0.81\\*|\n|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.51\\*|\n|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.51\\*|\n|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*|12.7\\*|\n|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*|0.37\\*|\n|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.37\\*|\n|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\\*|N/A *(see below)*|\n|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*|N/A|\n|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*|N/A|\n|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*|N/A|\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nI personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.\n\n[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/b4fciml7icj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc98159f13279e91a62c0734ded41f909474cc55)\n\nFundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend (tweet). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **COMMON QUESTIONS:**\n\n**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***\n\n**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 (page 169). Here's a prior post thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.\n\n**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***\n\n**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however he speculated it may be October (Q4).\n\n**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***\n\n**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and \"near completion\"\\*.\n\n**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***\n\n**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue here (start at 4:00).\n\n**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (examples*** 1***,*** 2***,*** 3***,*** 4***)***\n\n**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **PERSONAL POSITION:**\n\nI won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like \"proof or ban\" I will happily provide screen shots privately.\n\n*^(Disclaimer: Nothing above or below constitutes professional and/or financial advice, nor does any information presented here constitute a comprehensive or complete statement of the matters discussed.

I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.\n\nI'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.\n\n*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish \"DD.\" I had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum.* ***I've removed all links*** *to appease the WSB automoderator which doesn't seem to want to let anything through. Random asterisks and parentheticals were previously outside resources.*\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **BACKGROUND:**\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvr2x4gejcj71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2c052633c6b847fdfbb716bf3617d806f89ae7c\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes CCIV rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - CCIV-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9y0s2qzfjcj71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6974d1b3de47b60a7d45050cb66ae9772304583\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0nz7i9hjcj71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b38e77812313065eae870cc538ae7b686281ced\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwumh1eijcj71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=975bcc797e004fa3f4d1f3066d06c23ea90d0c76\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n*Processing img 5m7t3j8ljcj71...*\n\n*\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/5t06p5amjcj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63c6f7688798ec986d955a8e78068369900b5858)\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhwmkt4ojcj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=923c7a857f53f14174160d5ba46ce02abc715eeb\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5kzp24qjcj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46029b376c10c06afa37b72ddbe04a90a7fe8623\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n[Lucid Energy Storage System \\(ESS\\)](https://preview.redd.it/nnv0cxnrjcj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c92f140f2f6a1933f66ad6c714b17f65934a3d90)\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*|18.33\\*|\n|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*|0.81\\*|\n|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.51\\*|\n|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.51\\*|\n|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*|12.7\\*|\n|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*|0.37\\*|\n|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*|0.37\\*|\n|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\\*|N/A *(see below)*|\n|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*|N/A|\n|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*|N/A|\n|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*|N/A|\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nI personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.\n\n[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/s41mp0ytjcj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac780fc580766571e2bf64b36407af0fac6f1c84)\n\nFundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend (tweet). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **COMMON QUESTIONS:**\n\n**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***\n\n**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 (page 169). Here's a prior post thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.\n\n**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***\n\n**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however he speculated it may be October (Q4).\n\n**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***\n\n**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and \"near completion\"\\*.\n\n**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***\n\n**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue here (start at 4:00).\n\n**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (examples*** 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **PERSONAL POSITION:**\n\nI won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like \"proof or ban\" I will happily provide screen shots privately.\n\n*^(Disclaimer: Nothing above or below constitutes professional and/or financial advice, nor does any information presented here constitute a comprehensive or complete statement of the matters discussed.

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/goodbye-summer-hello-all-time-high?justPublished=true).\n\n**TLDR:** Stock market news sentiment was significantly bullish (ie. optimistic into the future) driven by new all-time high S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ prices, B!tcoin eclipsing $50K benchmark, and regarding upcoming economic data to be released (jobs, housing, manufacturing reports next week).\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news bounced back towards significantly bullish sentiment, with the average article recording an optimistic 0.30 sentiment score (which is *double* the average sentiment score posted last week) and impressive 0.67 time-sense score; this means approximately one third of all sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically, and an overlapping two thirds of all sentences were written in future-tense. **Both scores add up to indicate that market conversation remains highly bullish, expressing high degrees of optimism about the future.**\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\n*Each week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here:* [Most Mentioned Tickers Table 8/23-8/27](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4eeaf148-8cef-437e-b7fa-a4e10af08411_1231x1169.jpeg)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e\u00a0[**Apple Inc. ($AAPL)**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)**: The most-mentioned ticker in stock market news coverage this week was $AAPL.** The company\u2019s stock finished the week at $148.60 per share, and showed moderate optimism expressed in news sentiment. Many of Apple\u2019s headlines this week centered on CEO Tim Cook as he celebrated his 10-year anniversary in the pilot\u2019s chair \u2014 per his contract with the company, he received 5-million shares of $AAPL stock this week to the tune of $750M, according to SEC filings. His influence on the company\u2019s trajectory over the past decade has been undeniable, as he is now responsible for creating more shareholder value than any CEO *ever* ( ($2.1 trillion dollars, shown [here](http://%20%28%242.1%20trillion%20dollars%29/)). Other headlines from Apple came this week in the form of Warren Buffett wisdom, as the billionaire Berkshire CEO stated he\u2019d be adding more shares of $AAPL to his portfolio as a hedge against rising inflation. Buffett \u2014 who himself ranks #7 on the list of all-time shareholder value produced \u2014 has been a long-time proponent of Apple, and [argues](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-according-161829003.html) that now is a better time than ever to be purchasing the stock.

($RIOT)**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIOT/)**: Riot Blockchain saw this week\u2019s biggest increase in news headlines compared to last week** after announcing its Q2 earnings report on Monday; average news sentiment expressed was moderately optimistic with a score of 0.32. The B!tcoin-mining company posted a quarterly earnings-per-share of $0.22, broadly eclipsing its consensus analyst estimates of $0.02 and signaling immense improvement from its -$0.31 EPS loss posted a year ago. In the report, Riot reported B!tcoin-mining revenues exceeding $31M, an astounding 1540% increase from last year, coupled with 70% increase in its mining revenue margins. The company attributed much of its mining capacity growth to its successful acquisition of Whinstone (an infrastructure provider), and to significant efforts related to de-risking its operational structure. With such encouraging numbers to report and with B!tcoin\u2019s price re-eclipsing the $50K benchmark, $RIOT stock price grew 5.17% to $38.57 per share \u2014 a 1,007% increase in price from the same time last year.

Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\n*Each week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. By our analysis, here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in last week\u2019s news:* [Ticker News Sentiment Chart 8/23-8/27](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed7ae131-4122-42a1-a212-303c0b9ce81a_2166x1290.png)\n\n\ud83c\udfec [**Best Buy Inc. ($BBY):**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/)\u00a0**This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Best Buy** ***(optimism score: 59.7%).***\u00a0$BBY stock rose 3.98% to end the week back above its $115 price level after the company released Q2 earnings on Tuesday. In their quarterly report, Best Buy announced earnings a sales increase of 20% over the past 90-days, exceeding the forecast of 17% set by management in their previous report. The consumer electronics retailer attributed much of this growth to charging higher prices for products across their computing and premium home appliance segments, citing heightened demand for technology upgrades as people are beginning to permanently embrace habits like working from home and streaming TV. The ability to raise their margins across segments has boded well, allowing the company to achieve its highest profitability rate ever of more than 6% operating margins (see [chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/9d766a7052b6ce9fca69af524780fd8c.png)). This renewed reassurance of strong business growth after a string of week quarters financially has raised eyebrows across Wall Street, with the likes of Jim Cramer saying that Best Buy\u2019s turnaround brings broader implications to the e-commerce landscape: \u201cBest Buy\u2019s basically replacing corporate tech support for remote works\u201d. This week\u2019s most optimistic $BBY news article:\n\n&gt;*\u201cBest Buy Shares Rise on Earnings Beat, Retailer says Consumers are Upgrading Tech to Work at Home\u201d*\u00a0|\u00a0[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/best-buy-bby-earnings-q2-2022.html)\n\n\ud83c\udfed [**Celanese Corp ($CE):**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CE/)\u00a0**This week\u2019s most pessimistic stock in news coverage was Celanese**\\*\\*\\*(pessimism score: 47.6%).\\*\\*\\*\u00a0It should be noted that Celenese \u2014 a global hybrid chemical company based in Irving, Texas \u2014 was also the most speculative stock in news coverage three weeks ago, after the company announced a significant beat of its Q2 earnings estimates; since then the stock has moved steadily downhill for the most part. Despite $CE stock bouncing back this period up 3.4% to $160.25 per share, the company saw more pessimism expressed in news articles than any other ticker this week, driven by a string of negatively connotated articles written in responses to poor performance over the previous week (during which the company\u2019s stock price fell for six consecutive days to more than 10% below its 52-week high from May). The company also announced this week that it would be offering up to \u20ac 300M towards the purchase of its outstanding 1.125% senior notes due in 2023. Compared to close competitors like Exxon Mobile Corp. ($XOM) and Eastman Chemical Co.($EMN), Celanese has underperformed its peers over the last 30 days as the earnings fervor subdues. Despite the downward trajectory of the recent months, many analysts argue that the company could remain a reliable long-term hold due to its consistent earnings and dividends.

Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in eah of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last.* [Biggest Ticker Sentiment Changes 8/23-8/27](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e21704-47a6-4aee-aa44-ce645b144302_1899x756.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcb1\u00a0**Cardano ($ADA) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week.** The alt-coin, which now boasts the third-highest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, made waves in news coverage this week after eclipsing the $2.00 price benchmark last week and reaching a new all-time high price of $2.39 on Wednesday on the back of [comments](https://ambcrypto.com/hoskinson-says-cardano-is-on-a-different-path-than-ethereum-bitcoin/) from its outspoken founder Charles Hoskinson.\n\n\ud83d\udc8a\u00a0**CVS Health ($CVS) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week** after announcing that it would be limiting purchases of over-the-counter rapid COVID-19 tests in the coming weeks due to excess demand. While this news draws questions about the robustness of CVS\u2019s supply chain, the main takeaway seems to be its implications about the current severity of the pandemic. Accordingly, $CVS stock price fell 1.97% on the week.\n\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\u00a0**ContextLogic Inc. ($WISH) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last.** This comes a week after $WISH stock fell 9% on disappointing Q2 earnings. Throughout this week, the stock rallied back more than 5% to $6.94 on heavy volume from retail traders on r/WallStreetBets and the like, leaving [analysts](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/wish-stock-is-worth-sticking-with-even-after-its-dismal-earnings-report/) to wonder if the stock is worth sticking around for. Other highly speculative tickers in news this week include Intel ($INTC), Peloton ($PTON), Skyworks ($SKWS), and Applied Materials ($AMAT).\n\n\u2615\u00a0**Starbucks Inc. ($SBUX) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed** driven by a multitude of articles written about its recent ability to capture consumer trends as a business \u2014 including this [piece](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/25/3-reasons-why-starbucks-could-win-as-students-retu/) which anticipates a bump in sales as college students return to in-person classes, and [social media buzz](https://twitter.com/uDontKnoDietz/status/1430589780799234059?s=20) driven by its early introduction of pumpkin spice-themed drinks -(before Labor Day? is that legal?). Other highly reactive tickers this week include Boeing ($BA), Walmart ($WMT), Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ), and IBM ($IBM).\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news saw another boost in optimism back to its recent high levels as the markets peaked above new all-time high price points. Speculation in the news remains abound as we wrap up the month of August and transition into the final months of 2021. **While stocks have performed well in recent weeks on top of outstanding earnings reports across the board, inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty remain top of mind.**\n\nWe said it last week and we\u2019ll say it again: the heightened optimism in the news is a reassuring hand in today\u2019s market, but a signifcant shift in mood or economic catalysts (or some combination of the two, realistically) have the potential to bring the market back down to Earth. We will look ahead to vital economic reports (and their reactions) this week, including: housing data to be released Tuesday, manufacturing and service economy trends to be released Wednesday and Friday, and August\u2019s monthly job report due Friday.\n\nWith this in mind, good luck to all in this final week of trading before Labor Day. Stay tuned later this week for an extra newsletter about what we are reading heading into this Fall, and some in-depth analysis about what we saw in the news over the month of August. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

        "selftext": "Hey all, I\u2019m just some tech nerd who likes to dabble in investing and \"investing.\" However, there is a company that I\u2019m interacting with that, frankly, I\u2019m surprised hasn\u2019t blown up higher than they are. Figured I\u2019d share it on a much more popular place, because I think it deserves a little love.\u00a0\n\nAmbarella ($AMBA) is a somewhat small (3.4B market cap as of writing this) semiconductor company that seems to be very focused on creating the best computer vision processors out there. They also make really good, normal application processors that have fantastic video processing capabilities. I've gotten my hands on them a bit, not as much as I would like, but I see some promise in their new stuff and think they're undervalued.\u00a0\n\n# Competition:\n\nBasically if you think of AI vision processing you probably have the one behemoth in mind: Nvidia. How the hell is this company that's worth 1/200th of Nvidia going to compete? Well it comes down to architecture. Nvidia slams the same design from their top end A series card to their lowest end GPU, designed for hardcore parallel processing like you would expect a GPU to be. This works for sure, but it is inefficient for pure vision processing, compared to a purpose built processor. Ambarella can do stereoscopic vision processing in their highest end processor in a silicon die that's probably at least 5x smaller than Nvidia's highest end processor, at likely significantly less cost too. That's a big deal for both power efficiency, and pure cost.\u00a0\n\nAMBA is also one of two companies that has an AI vision and video processing API with AWS. I bet you can guess the other one. That's great for developers to get used to the ecosystem, and easy access to new talent that may be able to bring their employer in.\u00a0\n\nI am unaware of any other company that has nearly the level of ability in their processors for computer vision. With the constant increase of self driving startups out there, I can only imagine that AMBA playing at the top of the field alone will be huge, as not every single company can afford hundreds of millions to design their own silicon, like Tesla did after moving away from NVDA.\u00a0\n\n# Catalysts:\n\nAMBA is holding their earnings one week from now, August 31st. This will be the first earnings that they are going to have been working with ARVL and KeepTruckin. KeepTruckin handles 90,000 drivers in the US currently, and ARVL has at least 10k sales planned in the future. I\u2019ll let those people talk more about what\u2019s going on there, I\u2019m not up to date with the car manufacturer space and I\u2019m pretty sure that they were a meme stock at some point, so they\u2019ll probably go crazy talking about all their sales that I\u2019m hoping they get.\u00a0\n\nHaving more customers as a semiconductor company creating products on high end process nodes is *basically free* when you\u2019re running in lower quantities. Why? How? Well it just comes down to the massive non-recurring costs in semiconductor manufacturing. This is something the semiconductor people know well, but I\u2019ll give a rough outline for those of you not in the know. Manufacturing silicon on the most cutting edge nodes is insanely expensive, even if you\u2019re just wanting to produce one single die, you\u2019re spending tens, or hundreds of millions of dollars just to make the patterns to make your chip. For TSMC 7nm it\u2019s likely in the hundred to hundreds of millions of dollars that you have to spend once. Every single wafer you buy gets made with those patterns. Each wafer costs money of course, but each one pales in comparison to the amount you spend in the actual photomasks to make your chips.\n\nIf they end up selling more chips, the NR costs get spread out over more, allowing either more competitive pricing if they want, or just more profit. With what is probably 100k of their top end chip sales public, that's a big deal for AMBA as each of their chips costs probably ~$50 to make, and probably sells for significant multiples of that. They are also definitely selling many more than that in more low-end devices like security cameras and action cameras, but that's not the high end flashy cool tech so I'm not gonna bore everyone with that.\u00a0\n\n# Future: \n\nThis is more of a \"what I see and what I want\" kinda section. I'm very much an outsider, and it's very hard to get any word from the company, so everything here should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nI can definitely see AMBA upping their software friendliness and taking a page out of Nvidia's book and making a Jetson competitor. As I said in the title, they're a very quiet company. I would have never heard about them had I not been working with building software for action cameras. Getting their products and software into the hands of real developers to create products with their chips, regardless of if they sell 100 or 100k would be good for sales directly, and massive for brand recognition. AMBA is competing directly with custom silicon, like what's in Tesla, Waymo in my opinion, and if they can get a good enough product that it's worth these big companies not spending hundreds of millions to make their own silicon and instead just using the CV2 processor or whatever comes next, that's be great. I'm seeing the same thing that happened way back in the 90s with companies that had their own custom processors just moving to Intel or AMD because it just didn't make sense to spend the money designing and building their own processor when they could just use someone else's. If AMBA could become the Intel or AMD of computer vision, that's be pretty huge. \n\n## Position and plan\n\nWhat am I planning on doing? Well, hodling my 100 shares. I\u2019m no rich man, and frankly although I think this earnings will be fantastic, good news isn\u2019t always correlated with good stock price. So dumb shares it is, no options or anything.\u00a0",

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "W\ufffcith Apple\u2018s iPhone typical fall launch is fast approaching, details about the device\u2019s new capabilities have started to leak out.\n\nAs consumers and gadget fans pore over the tidbits for taste of what Apple\u2019s (ticker: AAPL) latest pocket computetr will have in store, chip investors too are scrutinizing the trickle of information. In a Tuesday report, Bloomberg News said the new Apple phones will feature new video and camera features, a faster Apple-designed chip to power the gadget, and new screen technology. Apple will keep the same iPhone dimensions and designs as last year\u2019s models, the report said.\n\nBased on the scarce available details, the exact makeup of the guts of the next line of iPhones is highly speculative at this point. But, investors know a few things already based on past designs and the bare-bones description. \n\nOne of the biggest changes in recent memory was the iPhone\u2019s adoption of 5G technology, requiring a batch of new chips to support the fast uplink speed. For many phones, including Apple\u2019s, that tended to mean much more silicon overall, which was good news for the chip makers that supply Apple with parts.\n\nFor the 5G modems themselves, the iPhone 12 contained chips made by Qualcomm (QCOM), which suggests it too will likely supply the iPhone\u2019s 5G wireless chip\u2014at least for now. Apple has reportedly launched its own effort to design wireless radios, so that may change in the future. The chip giant has made other chips for the iPhones such as power modules. \n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) make radio-related iPhone components, too, and have both been historic suppliers. Broadcom (AVGO) also has made wireless chips and other iPhone components. Barclays chip analyst Blayne Curtis has staked Qorvo has his favorite of the batch of Apple suppliers he watches.\n\nFor the new camera, it\u2019s possible Texas Instruments (TXN) could play a role, as it has supplied the power-management chip for previous iterations of the iPhone camera. Its chips that help with battery-charging have also been spotted in past phones.\n\nMemory-wise, according to an iFixit teardown, the last iPhone used random access memory made by Micron Technology (MU). Micron has said the 5G upgrade cycle has benefited it because new generation phones typically carry more RAM than their 4G counterparts. The iPhone 12\u2019s flash storage was produced by closely held Kioxia Holdings, a Japanese memory maker that has been considering an initial public offering in recent months.\n\nWe know Apple is designing the chips that power its phones, and has for several generations, effectively cutting out Qualcomm from the processor part of iPhone revenue. Taiwan \nSemiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), has made the chip in the past, and it is all but certain to be making the latest iPhone processors.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nSome of the semi stocks mentioned in this article are still worth to buy. qcom, tsm, mu, skws and qrvo are all trading between 20 to 30 pe.

        "selftext": "W\ufffcith Apple\u2018s iPhone typical fall launch is fast approaching, details about the device\u2019s new capabilities have started to leak out.\n\nAs consumers and gadget fans pore over the tidbits for taste of what Apple\u2019s (ticker: AAPL) latest pocket computetr will have in store, chip investors too are scrutinizing the trickle of information. In a Tuesday report, Bloomberg News said the new Apple phones will feature new video and camera features, a faster Apple-designed chip to power the gadget, and new screen technology. Apple will keep the same iPhone dimensions and designs as last year\u2019s models, the report said.\n\nBased on the scarce available details, the exact makeup of the guts of the next line of iPhones is highly speculative at this point. But, investors know a few things already based on past designs and the bare-bones description. \n\nOne of the biggest changes in recent memory was the iPhone\u2019s adoption of 5G technology, requiring a batch of new chips to support the fast uplink speed. For many phones, including Apple\u2019s, that tended to mean much more silicon overall, which was good news for the chip makers that supply Apple with parts.\n\nFor the 5G modems themselves, the iPhone 12 contained chips made by Qualcomm (QCOM), which suggests it too will likely supply the iPhone\u2019s 5G wireless chip\u2014at least for now. Apple has reportedly launched its own effort to design wireless radios, so that may change in the future. The chip giant has made other chips for the iPhones such as power modules. \n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) make radio-related iPhone components, too, and have both been historic suppliers. Broadcom (AVGO) also has made wireless chips and other iPhone components. Barclays chip analyst Blayne Curtis has staked Qorvo has his favorite of the batch of Apple suppliers he watches.\n\nFor the new camera, it\u2019s possible Texas Instruments (TXN) could play a role, as it has supplied the power-management chip for previous iterations of the iPhone camera. Its chips that help with battery-charging have also been spotted in past phones.\n\nMemory-wise, according to an iFixit teardown, the last iPhone used random access memory made by Micron Technology (MU). Micron has said the 5G upgrade cycle has benefited it because new generation phones typically carry more RAM than their 4G counterparts. The iPhone 12\u2019s flash storage was produced by closely held Kioxia Holdings, a Japanese memory maker that has been considering an initial public offering in recent months.\n\nWe know Apple is designing the chips that power its phones, and has for several generations, effectively cutting out Qualcomm from the processor part of iPhone revenue. Taiwan \nSemiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), has made the chip in the past, and it is all but certain to be making the latest iPhone processors.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nSome of the semi stocks mentioned in this article are still worth to buy. qcom, tsm, mu, skws and qrvo are all trading between 20 to 30 pe. The revenue growth for these stocks are still attractive. With apple releasing the new iphones at September, these stocks will definitely benefit from the ongoing 5G trend.",
