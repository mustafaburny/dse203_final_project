        "selftext": "My father worked at IBM for 30 years back in the day, and somehow acquired only one share of stock along the way. He died a few years ago, and my mother keeps receiving quarterly checks for less than $2.00.  She can't deposit them because they're in his name, and the process to get the share transferred to her name costs more than the share is worth because she needs to replace the lost certificate first.  She's stuck in one-share-limbo because it doesn't seem worth the time or the money to transfer the share, but every three months she gets re-annoyed and we end up having yet another conversation about whether or not she should go through the process. \n\nWhat would you do?",
