        "selftext": "From WSJ:\n\nMillions of people are behind on their credit-card and auto-loan payments, the latest sign of the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s financial devastation.\n\nLenders in April had nearly 15 million credit cards in \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d programs, such as deferral programs that let borrowers temporarily stop making payments, according to estimates by credit-reporting firm TransUnion. That accounts for about 3% of the credit-card accounts the company tracks, TransUnion said Wednesday.\n\nNearly three million auto loans were in these hardship programs, accounting for about 3.5% of those tracked.\n\nThe numbers have surged from a year ago, when 0.03% of credit cards and about 0.5% of auto loans were in financial-hardship programs.\n\nThe spike in unemployment caused by the coronavirus has strained people\u2019s ability to make their monthly debt payments. To make matters worse, Americans were tapping credit cards and auto loans at record levels even before the pandemic to deal with rising costs and stagnant incomes.\n\nAs coronavirus cases surged in the U.S. and businesses shut down, millions of people told their lenders they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay their bills. Some lenders have allowed borrowers to miss payments for as long as several months on credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-americans-skip-credit-card-and-car-payments-11589985381?tesla=y&amp;mod=article\\_inline](https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-americans-skip-credit-card-and-car-payments-11589985381?tesla=y&amp;mod=article_inline) \n\nIn past week:\n\nAmex up 14%\n\nMastercard up 11%\n\nVisa up 9% \n\nThey're up 3-3.5% today.

        "selftext": "In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), I'll be following up on a few posts I made a few weeks ago about what the stock market will look like over the next few weeks. [Three weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9h9np/an_indepth_look_into_the_next_few_weeks/), I talked about the stock market needing consolidating, staying in between 272 and 293, which mostly stayed true (+- 2%). [I then talked about the declining retail sentiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd1t2g/dddd_the_rise_of_buy_the_dip_retail_investors_and/), which drove the stock market to euphoria levels, and how we won't be making any new highs in the bull rally we've been seeing any time soon, which also so far has held true. Let's take another look at potential catalysts that can cause us to break the channel that we've been in the past few weeks.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Oil**\n\nThe WTI June oil futures contract will be expiring on May 19th. Everyone around the world remembered what happened when May oil futures expired - reality caught up. While futures prices can be driven by speculation, on expiration, it will need to converge with the real price (spot price) of oil based on supply and demand for it. Let\u2019s see how crude prices have been for the June contract.\n\n[\\/CLM2020](https://preview.redd.it/wb0yl0zh6gz41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6235b72d8806e665396616eccfa9bc25b6ce19)\n\n[Oil Futures Contango](https://preview.redd.it/wlhqr7sk6gz41.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f583cd5a30fd28c41fd6fe0195a42b0ccf07b517)\n\nLooks like oil prices have recovered to pre-lockdown levels, with June contracts priced right under $30 / barrel. Super-contango seems to also be gone, with only a $0.09 difference between June and July contracts. Another way to think about this is that it should thus only cost $0.09 to store one barrel of oil for one month. Contrast this with April 21, where the difference between June and July contracts were more than $7 / barrel. This should put immense downwards pressure on oil storage spot prices, hence a decline in oil tanker stock prices due to expected lower revenue as a result of this.\n\n[$EURN Daily](https://preview.redd.it/kqw9o85m6gz41.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec9f2fde4096ac652c6735c9ebe1ea5931a3a883)\n\nSo is the higher oil prices and decreased contango justified? Let\u2019s look at some metrics published by the Department of Energy.\n\n[Refinery inputs and production](https://preview.redd.it/j8chnhxo6gz41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad4ff0aa483c5905489bdff25ab417749cc956cb)\n\n[Crude Oil Stocks](https://preview.redd.it/i6m64iqq6gz41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25a09370dbeaa5293a27c43a116b6adb5cadf3dd)\n\n[Crude Oil Spot Prices](https://preview.redd.it/sqt6jzwr6gz41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaae60e3f929bd79a1139ad512d79db21b29be9a)\n\nCrude inputs to refineries have decreased for the week of May 8 compared to May 1 by about 600kbpd, and is still below the 4-week moving average. Refinery capacity is also still moving on a downtrend, with a 68% utilization for the week of May 8, below the 71% utilization the week before and slightly below the 69% 4-week moving average. We do see a dramatic increase in motor fuel outputs, increasing by about 800kbpd in between weeks of May 8 and May 1, above the 4-week MA. This is likely due to lockdown restrictions being lifted across multiple states, and refineries increasing production in anticipation of increased motor fuel consumption.The decrease in crude inputs last week may indicate that they\u2019ve been overly optimistic and have since decreased utilization.\n\nCrude oil stocks are still increasing, with an additional 1.2M barrels compared to May 1, despite net oil imports decreasing. In Cushing, we do see oil stocks to finally be decreasing with a net change of 3M barrels being taken out of that area in between May 1 and May 8, probably in anticipation of futures contracts expiring. Stocks of motor gasoline are decreasing, indicating increased demand for it as lockdowns ended, and probably prompted refineries to increase production.\n\nOverall, it seems like the story has been that oil demand is slowly restoring with states lifting lockdown, but not as fast as refiners are expecting. Despite decreased supply, crude oils stocks are still slowly increasing. Storage facilities in Cushing have shit\u00a0their more together this time and are moving their oil stocks from Cushing towards other storage facilities with availability to avoid a storage squeeze like last time. Oil stocks are still increasing, but oil stocks are being allocated more efficiently to utilize excess capacity in other regions, especially away from Cushing, leading to a slowly increasing spot oil price in Cushing despite oil stocks nationwide oil stock increases.\n\n**COVID-19 and Lockdowns**\n\nThe US is currently at approx. 1.5M confirmed cases, and 90K deaths.\n\n[US New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/22m7lkrv6gz41.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b1fc1f6a9be6ecf930510315965754469989bd4)\n\nWe\u2019re seeing a slow decline of new cases; i.e. \u201cflattening the curve\u201d. It doesn\u2019t seem like new cases are being decreased significantly even during lockdown.\n\nIn New York, which has been hardest hit and still under lockdown, we see a significant decline.\n\n[New York New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/huqo5mhx6gz41.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dc3c1f5589540876c8099abff0386ffe70c0ae1)\n\nWe see stay-at-home orders being lifted in several states, and most states reopening retail stores, as well as being in the process of opening dine-in restaurants back up.\n\n[States under lockdown](https://preview.redd.it/og5slqiz6gz41.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af542da9d3ed3a10a6cac00820e87274dc323794)\n\n[States with dine-in restaurants open](https://preview.redd.it/177ddp607gz41.png?width=1286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f437c681cf1e4e4dee3c6e59caa7336807b222e)\n\n[States with retail stores open](https://preview.redd.it/ltr5a0117gz41.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e6911b52af75529a4dbb736e6c623793e5aa37f)\n\nWhat has the effects of reopening been so far? Let\u2019s look at one state, Georgia, which has been the earliest to reopen three weeks ago.\n\n[Georgia New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/13que5f87gz41.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ecadebd82c3103fdf1825c249fa743453f6ab4)\n\nTheir new cases have remained effectively flat since re-opening. So while there hasn\u2019t been a new surge in cases, their situation is not improving.\n\nItaly, which has been one of the hardest hit countries, along with the United States, has seen a dramatic improvement with a steady and consistent decline of new cases, giving hope that the US, with a timeline a few weeks behind Italy, will soon be on the other side of the first wave. Italy started easing restrictions around May 4, with shops and restaurants planning to be re-opened by May 18.\n\n[Italy New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/dnlfhp9b7gz41.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21b4120501444755353304be2368c4048a04a02c)\n\nOn the other hand, Iran, a country that also was hit by COVID-19 earlier than the US is seeing another spike in cases and is already dealing with a second wave.\n\n[Iran New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/i47hzm5d7gz41.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7cfc32b6ffa7a23b2b730bd82715d3a26d6d7e4)\n\nWe\u2019ll likely see lockdowns across multiple US states being lifted over the next few weeks.\n\n**US-China Tensions**\n\nThe US has recently imposed export restrictions on Huawei that will prevent any chipmakers using American technology from making sales to it. In response, China may be putting American technology companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, and Cisco, on a \u201cunreliable entity list\u201d, which will apply very severe restrictions to those companies\u2019 operations and trade within China.\n\n**Round 4 Stimulus**\n\nThe house has recently passed a phase 4 stimulus bill, the HEROES Act, which will include many provisions including another $1200 check to everyone. This bill passed with Republican resistance, with a 208-199 vote. Most political analysts agree that this phase will take a long time to negotiate and won\u2019t pass as quickly as previous phases, with it passing in June at the earliest.\n\n**Tech Antitrust Filings**\n\nA leak on Friday from the Justice Department indicates that antitrust lawsuits will be filed against Google later this year. Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are also currently under investigation and may also have antitrust suits filed against them at the same time.\n\n**Liquidity the Federal Reserve**\n\nThe Fed recently published their [financial stability report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20200515.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589777923796000)\u00a0on Friday, which talks about the state of the economy, financial system, and gives forward guidance on what might happen next. Here\u2019s a summary of the interesting parts of their report.\n\nVulnerabilities in the financial sectors\n\n* Asset Valuations especially risky assets (i.e. equities) have risen since mid-March and may be vulnerable to significant declines.\n* Business debt, relative to GDP, entered 2020 at historic highs, and had seen rapid increases among businesses with weak credit ratings.\n* Banks and brokers were well capitalized, but hedge funds and insurance companies were highly leveraged, which caused market dislocations when asset prices fell.\n* Funding risk - Although not as bad as 2007-2009, they saw significant strain in funding markets and required Fed intervention\n\nThe report then talks about various monetary issues that came up over the past few months, and actions that the Fed has taken to address them, like lowering interest rates, buying commercial paper and bonds, and infinite QE to stabilize credit markets. They also talk about the strain on the global dollar funding markets, and the international demand for dollars causing a widening of FX spreads (i.e. spike in DXY). To alleviate this, they extended swap lines to other central banks.\n\nIt also looks like the Fed is slowly winding down their \u201cinfinite QE\u201d program, falling from a peak of $75B / day of purchases to $6B / day.\n\n[Fed Treasury Purchases](https://preview.redd.it/h8sjmlge7gz41.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2789b31a207100ef863facd3ad514a7a07608500)\n\n**The Bigger Picture**\n\nWe\u2019re still seeing a slow net increase in oil stocks, despite the lower production and imports, as well as increased refinery utilization. However, oil is being stored more efficiently, with barrels being moved in places with a shortage capacity, like Cushing, to other places in the US. This, along with other actions recently taken by futures brokers, NYMEX, and USO, makes it a shock such as the one we saw when May contracts expired much less likely for the June contracts.\n\nNothing bad has yet to happen with states that have reopened, with daily increases stabilizing. We have yet to see if this translates to an economic recovery, and if current equity prices are justified. On the other hand, escalating US-China tensions around Huawei may further hurt equity valuations, especially technology companies, which seem to be possible targets of China for retaliation. The confirmation of antitrust filing to at least one tech giant, and the likelihood of further filings for other giants, may also further hurt stock prices in the tech sector, where equity valuations have declined the least throughout the crisis.\n\nThe Federal reserve is slowly winding down their QE, and warning that there are still substantial prices in the credit markets and that asset valuations may see a dramatic decrease. From the fiscal side, although a phase 4 stimulus is being considered and has passed the house, it is unlikely we will see this pass anywhere as quickly as the other rounds.\n\nThe market has already seemed to price in lifting of lockdowns, combined with weakening monetary stimulus and uncertainty about the possibility of further fiscal stimulus, provides a weak bullish case for further upside in equities. In the meanwhile, potential shocks from antitrust actions and Chinese retaliation to large technology monopolies, which consists of more than a fifth of the S&amp;P500, along with a potential second wave, such as seen in Iran, can be a catalyst to break below 272.\n\n**Magic Markers and My Personal Strategy**\n\nFor those interested in what I'll be personally doing, and those that have been following me, I'm currently holding SPY puts and VIX calls (among other positions) which I entered back when SPY hit 293, although I did exit my shorter-term SPY puts on Friday after fucking up and missing my exit on Thursday after not following my own strategy that I wrote.\n\n[\\/ES Daily](https://preview.redd.it/xx3cge849gz41.png?width=1710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a28b3decaeb6f5514077e76254f35788053f4f61)\n\nThe 1D MACD on both /ES and SPY did crossover to bearish, with a larger volume than previous days, which makes me confident that over the medium-term we'll be seeing a downtrend, and is one of the things I need to confirm a drop below 272 for the next drop.\n\nOn the short-term, the 1H MACD is bullish, meaning we're going to need to consolidate over the next day or two. That being said, RSI is heading towards overbought territory.\n\n[\\/ES Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/xlkdmefw9gz41.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6808ddf2340b95ef34caef4d1edc0c3ecf1c634)\n\nLooking at the 15M chart, we've already hit overbought territory, and MACD is turning bearish.\n\n[\\/ES 15M](https://preview.redd.it/56esfbwgagz41.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2f4c77be858e0bc264cdbc5478754e1e9215db9)\n\nThis probably means we're going to be opening somewhere below 288 on SPY tomorrow. Depending on how futures act overnight, we'll probably either see a trading range of 285 - 290 or 278 - 285, depending if we open above or below 285. My strategy is to hold my longer-dated SPY puts and VIX calls, and re-enter my short-dated spreads when SPY RSI is overbought again on the 1H chart or 1H MACD crosses over again.\n\nAs with my posts the last few weeks, I'll be updating this post with a regular updates on what my magic marker horoscope says.\n\nP.S. - I got alot of invites and requests to just form a Discord channel with TA updates and thoughts. Although I was originally considering moving this to Discord, I've decided against it since you should not be basing your trading strategy on what some person on the internet is saying, and I'm personally very against trading chat rooms. This is your own money and you should be doing your own DD. If you were going to be spending thousands of dollars on buying something, you would probably be spending hours doing your own research on which product to buy and pros and cons of buying something - this should be no different. I'll post these for inspiration, and to help teach everyone reading how to do their own research, but this is by no means a recommendation on what you should do. Form your own opinions; it's your money.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, it's ya boi Tatar here with some boring TA for you to think about. Since understanding simple charts requires an IQ of at least 80, I estimate that 90% of you will have no idea what I'm talking about and just skip to the bottom to copy my position. Lucky for you that I am not so greedy that I don't care about you as well, just look at the fancy chart and let that justify your decision to throw your life savings into more SPY puts. Additional DD is optional. It's better that way.\n\nI've been waiting for today for about a month now, and it is a glorious day indeed. Here is the chart in question: (don't worry, I will explain all the fancy lines and circles to you. Wouldn't want you to have an aneurysm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/joo46x355my41.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b53774da10f5a7ec64825731b4d8447298503692\n\nThe red and green blocks: volume, retard\n\nThe fancy orange line: 21 day moving average for volume\n\nThe confusing white line: 21 day VWMA. I know acronyms are hard, that's okay. Ask your wifes boyfriend for help if you're confused.\n\nFebruary 24th and April 6th are the dates in question. Had you then followed what I'm about to tell you then, you'd be swimming in tendies and hunny mussy.\n\nBasically, the VWMA line serves as a line of support and resistance. When the price action breaks that barrier, WITH VOLUME, it is a strong indicator of a reversal. I use the 21 day MA for volume as a good indicator to let me see where volume is at at any given time. As you see, on Feb 24th the price action crossed the VWMA with volume and continued until we reached our March 23rd bottom. Two times the price action tested VWMA, but did not have enough bullish buyers to continue. This brings us to the enigma of April 6th...\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket surgeon to see that the crossover on April 6th was met with lower volume numbers. This is not an indication of a trend reversal but is a warning sign of instability. If you were one of those that thought JPow cancelled the recession, you simply didn't do your DD and are just throwing 50 on black.  To be honest, I am surprised the rally lasted as long as it did on continually decreasing volume numbers. As price continued to trend up, volume continued to go lower, staying consistently under the 21MA. UNTIL TODAY\n\nSo, why is today significant? Not only did the price action cross over the VWMA, but it did so while volume crossed over the 21MA. Increased volume + VWMA crossover = high probability of trend reversal.\n\nSo, what does this mean for you? Well, depending on your risk tolerance, you can play this one of three ways:\n\n* Big Dick Risk: Spy puts at open tomorrow\n* Good Enough Dick Risk: Wait to confirm one more bar of increased volume met with decreased price, then Spy puts EOD tomorrow\n* Vaginal risk: Sell everything at open and buy the dip\n\nPosition: SPY 255p 9/30, WW 25p 10/16, NAT 5c 6/19 (tanker gang unite \u270a)",

The combination of this dominance and the insulated nature of their business models have led to a lot of frustration for anyone running TA on the SPX during the recent rally.  With the risk of earnings behind us on big tech, lets take a look at how these bad boys are looking and what the implications are for the broader market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN Daily](https://preview.redd.it/l59fkfoj7mw41.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fefb7961f5afa7b1a314e8c8e4427b7b232fc49)\n\nThere was a ton of speculation on AMZN going into earnings, but it is time for this baby to check back to the 2,000 - 2,200 range.  This would be a healthy pull back after the breakout to new highs, but would put a dent in the SPX performance.  MACD crossed over on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MSFT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/dfztu9s99mw41.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65341521aa5cf30f6b296b5b8a6c14b95da2fc0e)\n\nMSFT broke its uptrend a couple weeks ago, but hung on as it has an insulated business model and (IMO) if you are an index fund you couldn't afford to miss a breakout on earnings due to the contribution.  With earnings out and MACD waning after the double top at 180, I'm betting on a move back down to the 50 day MA.  Again, a pretty standard check back, but the 7% move down will weigh on the index thanks to the 5.7% weight in the SPY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AAPL Daily](https://preview.redd.it/1eqk7rqyamw41.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaa9be1af319c90f4db71eb299f92340746721ad)\n\nAAPL, similar to MSFT, broke the uptrend a couple weeks ago, but was bid up into earnings.  With that behind us there is room for a healthy correction back to the 50 day MA at \\~270.  That is a 6.5% move down with an over 5% weight in the SPY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SPX Daily](https://preview.redd.it/q759igkjdmw41.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e70f5bef509a47100dd297c730bebbb35f7568b)\n\nTo tie things together, the rolling over of big tech could drive the S&amp;P down to the 50 day MA of \\~2,740.  If momentum to the downside picks up, we could see \\~2,640.  \n\n**TL/DR:**  Market sentiment has been influenced by big tech, so look for big tech to signal the next leg down.  With earnings out, technicals are turning negative, which removes the positive influence on broader market.  Tech is likely to outperform throughout this recession, but this increases the probability for downside moves on the names that are truly getting bent over.    \n\n**Positions:** SPXS, SPYp 5/15 +270/-260,  XLFp 6/19 +20/-18, ZMp 8/21 +130/-100, XLEp 6/19 35",

Currently it is public.  \n\nThe other catalyst is VM Ware (VMW) which is majority owned by DELL.  VMW is enterprise software used by corporations for remote access by end users on their intranets.

        "selftext": "Tl;dr buy 6/19 25c\n\nAlright you twats I am happy to share that I have some terrible free advice that I am willing to hand out. Not in any self-interested fashion because if you all pump this on my behalf I\u2019ll probably be more jacked to the tits than even you will be, but from an altruistic perspective of wanting what is best for all of WSB. So listen up, MOMO is the next Chinese meme stock and I am loading up the dump truck with some lottery tickets er options. Why you ask? Because I am bored, and I like tendies. With 0% confidence, here are the key factors driving my decision.\n\n**1.\tNon-financials AKA what matters most**\nChina\u2019s economy is back up and running in advance of the rest of the world, they have a huge population, and people were just stuck in quarantine for months. So guess what, a social media and dating platform company is probably in a good position to capitalize on that. In April 2020, Tantan (China Tinder which was acquired by Momo in 2018) ranked in the top 5 of data apps for overall revenue. Plus, JD.com, BABA, HUYA, etc. are killing it, and there seems to be resilience in the Chinese meme stocks.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/jwEJBKO\n\n**2.\tFinancials AKA what does not matter at all**\nI read somewhere that their discounted cash flow valuation is in the $45-$50 per share neighborhood. Plenty of Wall Street analysts have 12 month price targets in the $40 range, and the lower targets are still 10%+ ($26) above the current market value (~$23). Basically this company is printing money like JPow but investors are not buying in for various reasons. Call it Gyna fear, not trusting foreign companies, trade war, whatever. From a comparables perspective, MEET is trading at 60x TTM P/E, MTCH is trading at 42.53x TTM P/E, FB is trading at 30.67x TTM P/E. MOMO is trading at 11.79x. There is obviously a ton of room for multiple expansion, granted we are comparing US vs. Gyna so it is an imperfect comparison at best. NOT TO MENTION we are talking trailing-twelve-month multiples, which totally discounts the forward earnings growth rate advantage that MOMO has over its mature US-based peers. \n\nAdditionally the CEO owns over 20% of the outstanding common shares, so clearly he is incentivized to reverse the recent share price decline. He sold 5% of his holdings (1% of the shares outstanding) in 2017 and has not sold any stock since then.\n\nOn the analyst side of things, Thomas Chong from Jeffries was on the recent earnings calls asking direct questions to get information related to his 8/27/2019 buy recommendation with a price target of $42.20. Remember, this earnings call was mid-march and he absolutely could have changed his PT but has not. Three analysts did revise PTs after Q4 earnings, at $26, $26, and $36 respectively. Even if the bare minimum PT is realized sooner rather than later (read: June not 12 months from now) there is still ample upside in the stock.\n\n**3.\tTA**\nThe chart just looks stupid attractive, even after the pullback at EOD on 5/19. Stock just closed above the 50-day MA clearly breaking a long downtrend. Candlesticks are bullish showing a reversal with a pair of hammer candles at the bottom. There is clearly support at $22 and $20. If you look at the Fibonacci levels, there is a ton of room to the upside for retracement. Momentum indicators (Williams %R, Stochastics, and MACD) are all turning positive. First target is around $27 and the next is $30.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AM9Pj61\n\n**4.\tTiming \u2013 I have no fucking clue**\nMOMO is expected to report earnings on Thursday May 28th before the US market opens. There was tepid guidance issued on the March earnings call and I believe China has rebounded better than expected, so my guess is they will beat the previously set (low) guidance.\n\n**5.\tRisks**\n1. Gyna. Enough said\n2. False accounting and/or fraud. This is always a concern and possibility. I read through the entire last earnings call and looked into the background of the executive leadership and nothing jumped out as a major concern. Particularly the CFO has a clean record so that provides a level of comfort there. The operations executive clearly knows what lingo to use and what their company focus is to drive revenue. \n3. Institutional ownership decrease. Blackrock opened a 7.0% position ($750M) on 12/31/2019 and cut that same position to 4.3% ($316M) on 3/31/2020 which is a net realized loss of about $90M based on the difference in share price. Could be for any number of reasons. FMR LLC cut its ownership from 5.347% in 2/2019 to 0.403% in the same time period. Could be related, who knows. Big institutional outflows do not look great, but these fuckers might just have paper hands. These exits were not surprisingly at almost exactly a 20% loss, so I am going to chalk it up to responsible portfolio management \u2013 nothing any of us understand. Blackrock could have also just been rebalancing. Or the fact that this money is chump change compared to the trillions of AUM and it was a bad YOLO at that time. Do I think I am smarter than the boiis at Blackrock? Hell no. \n\nWhat I\u2019m buying\n6/19 25c; there was 1.3k volume on 5/19 against 283 open interest. If you wanted to hedge, you could open a strangle with a 20p.\n\nI am looking at maybe picking up July or October contracts as well but I truly do not understand the strike prices showing $XX.26 so I may not fuck with that noise.",

        "selftext": "Hello, as a new investor myself i thought this message might make you think before making rash decisions you may later go on to regret.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago while the markets were down i thought great, what a good time to invest. So i put some of my money onto a trading212 account and without even doing any research I bought contracts on crude oil without even knowing what the contracts meant. I did however, thanks to a reddit post realise my stupidity and got out of that quickly. \n\nI then thought right well i'll do some research and then re-evaluate. Now in my mind at this point doing research was simply browsing reddit, looking at what the general consensus was, seeing others portfolios and going off analysts. However, after doing that my portfolio was around 25 stocks big not even checking if they were overvalued or had a large amount of debt i just went for them because they were good companies imo. People commented say that this was way to many for a low amount of investment money (\u00a35000). So i sold all the ones i could but i had to leave some that were in the red hoping that they recover.\n\nThis is where i really did my research. I wanted to invest long term so i was looking for profitable companies, with a decent dividend and large growth potential and preferably little debt. For me I much prefer comparing number but i found flicking through webpage to webpage was hard to keep up with especially when comparing multiple companies. So i decided to create my own google sheets page, which imported companies data depending on the ticker and i did calculations to get other values (this took some time). This allowed me to get a much clearer picture of what the different companies futures were like.

        "selftext": "Hello, as a beginner investor myself i thought this message might make you think before making rash decisions you may later go on to regret.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago while the markets were down i thought great, what a good time to invest. So i put some of my money onto a trading212 account and without even doing any research I bought contracts on crude oil without even knowing what the contracts meant. I did however, thanks to a reddit post realise my stupidity and got out of that quickly. \n\nI then thought right well i'll do some research and then re-evaluate. Now in my mind at this point doing research was simply browsing reddit, looking at what the general consensus was, seeing others portfolios and going off analysts. However, after doing that my portfolio was around 25 stocks big not even checking if they were overvalued or had a large amount of debt i just went for them because they were good companies imo. People commented say that this was way to many for a low amount of investment money (\u00a35000). So i sold all the ones i could but i had to leave some that were in the red hoping that they recover.\n\nThis is where i really did my research. I wanted to invest long term so i was looking for profitable companies, with a decent dividend and large growth potential and preferably little debt. For me I much prefer comparing number but i found flicking through webpage to webpage was hard to keep up with especially when comparing multiple companies. So i decided to create my own google sheets page, which imported companies data depending on the ticker and i did calculations to get other values (this took some time). This allowed me to get a much clearer picture of what the different companies futures were like. It looks at their margins, ROI, ROE, ROA, EPS (tts), 1 year EPS, D/E, trailing P/E, forward P/E, P/B, P/C, P/FCF, PEG, dividend information, stock information as well as graphs to see which way the market is going (roughly, i know it unpredictable). I also looked and thought about the future of the companies and how it might affect their price e.g. Sony and Microsoft with the new generation consoles.\n\nAfter doing all this i have to say i found myself addicted to analysis, i **LOVE** it, i've managed to narrow down my stocks to 9 so they are easily trackable and i only plan to invest small amounts at a time (around \u00a3500 a week) until a clearer idea can be gathered amount the current market.\n\nI would encourage any of you new investors to do the same, it may take some time but it is worth it in the long run.

        "selftext": "Sup autists!!!!! (or however you retards get people's attention on here). LET'S MAKE LOTS OF TENDIES OFF AN UNDERVALUED STOCK.\n\nThis is my first DD post. Feel free to let me know if you would want more information in my next post.  Heard about $VERU last week on this sub and spent the weekend compiling a 12-page google doc w/ some DD, with a little help from my good friend Addy.  I've summarized the information for you guys here. You're welcome.  DM me if you want me to email you the entire DD document, but thought that the 12 pages of info I have would be a little much for the average retard on here to comprehend.  THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.\n\n$VERU is an oncology-based pharmaceutical company headed by a M.D. who is an expert in the field of urology and has 30+ year experience working with patients with prostate cancer.  He found significant limitations with the currently available pharmaceuticals for patients with advanced prostate cancer.  Quick overview: prostate cancer sucks dick.  If you get it (and 1 out of 41 men in the US will), you will likely have to be medically castrated via IV chemo (how does that sound?) and deal w/ the side effects that medical castration causes (you basically present as a post-menopausal woman - hot flashes, irritability, fatigue, bone loss and weakness, breast pain, breast enlargement).  The current therapeutic options also suck because they are a pain in the ass to administer (via IV chemo, large subcutaneous injection, etc. etc.) So, VERU is developing 3 different drugs that better the current treatment options out there for advanced prostate cancer; so medical castration be orally administered vs IV chemop (VERU-111), w/ decreased side effects (Zuclomiphene citrate), and administered less often (VERU-100).  These drugs are in Phase II-Phase III clinical trials, and have seen promising outcomes. The current market share of pharmaceuticals for prostate cancer is $12.8 billion, and per market research done by the company, they expect to see $6 billion annual revenue from just these 3 drugs.  These drugs should be hitting the US market when ready, with the latest drugs hitting in 2023. \n\nBut here's the kicker - they are SELF FUNDING the R&amp;D for the prostate cancer pharmaceuticals w/ the money from the sale of their patented specialty pharmaceuticals.  $VERU produces the ONLY FDA APPROVED FEMALE CONDOM, called FC2, which generated $9 mil in revenue just for Q1 of 2020, per their recent quarterly.  They also produce a drug that targets premature ejaculation (I'm sure lots of you guys know the pain) called PREBOOST, which is the active ingredient in Go Roman's Roman Swipes.  PREBOOST generated $500 mil in revenue for Q1.  I looked at Veru's financial reports from 2018... revenue from these products has been growing exponentially each quarter.  They also have a few other specialty pharm drugs in development.  \n\nSome financial #s for you guys:   \nStock price : $3.90 as of close yesterday   \nRevenue Growth: 5-year average - 5.36% growth, however, 154% growth between the 6 months ending March 30, 2019 and the same time period for 2020.   \nWall Street Analysts Price: $8.50 average, but a few notable analysts just upgraded the price following better than expected earnings.   \nE/S Ratio: -$.01  \nCash on Hand: $2.5 mil  \nAssets: $55.9 mil  \nTotal Debt: $2.3 mil (but remember, they are self-funding all R&amp;D)\n\nInstitutional investing is up by 2.5 mil shares in Feb, bringing total to 8.96 mil shares held by institutional investors.  There was also significant insider buying in February from Veru's leadership team. \n\nThe technicals also look strong for short term growth. A golden cross occurred May 2019, and the 200 MA provided strong resistance when the market crashed in March of this year.  The price has been seen steady growth since March, but is currently struggling to break resistance at 4, likely d/t low volume, which is CRAZY to be because this stock has HUGE potential.  Not only does it have huge potential, but I think the stock should be trading at a higher level just due to the currently available specialty pharm products which are on track to bring in $40 mil this year.  I digress. Anyways, I strongly believe we are in the handle portion of a finishing cup and handle pattern w/ next price resistance around $6. MacD is trending positive.  We're ripe for breakout. \n\nAgain, DM me if you want me to email you my full, 12-page report.  May the odds be ever in your favor.",

It is a general time I would like to pull out for short-term gains but I can keep it in there longer if it needs more time.\n\nI'm trying to learn as much as I can. I know the market will rally during crashes and bear markets can last 1-3 years. I have bought stocks in the past two months but I'm not used to holding stocks during a volatile market so I prefer to stay out so I don't have to worry about them Some of the stocks I want aren't going to move much in price anyway so I'm not in a hurry to buy them.

        "selftext": "These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist\ninvestors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.\nThere is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.\nSchedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management\n(such as Index funds).\n\nThere is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize\nis that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.\nThe reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.\nIn contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.\n\n## New Filings\nThis table lists new 13D filings in the last week.

The concept sounds very interesting to me, the company that compounds earnings like Visa or Mastercard, but doesn't demand the premium yet, since market doesn't know it yet. He mentions his investment in Fiat - Chrysler (FCAU) where he thought that Ferrari (RACE) alone is worth the whole company due to this reason. I have been thinking about it since yesterday, but I couldn't think of any. I also tried to identify some requirements for such a company.\n\n1. Low P/E: goal is obviously to find the ones that haven't appreciated in value yet, since Mr. Market doesn't know about or doesn't value their compounding ability yet. So they have to have earnings and P/E multiple growth potential. If they have high P/E I can just buy V or MA, where I am sure of their copounding ability.\n2. Addresable market that they dominate and is also growing, enabling the future growth of the company.\n3. High operating and net margin that signal strong moat and ability to earn a lot of money which they then reinvest in the bussines.\n4. Scalability without increasing costs; costs percentage should be decreasing considerably with scale. Something like Saas is the best representation of this.\n5. Reinvested earnings are effective at raising revenue. If company is just investing a lot of money, but there is no growth, then they lack compounding ability imo (like IBM for example).\n\nThese are just a few points that I am not even sure that apply so I would like to get your opinion.\n\nWhat criteria should we use to figure our if the company is a secret compunder? And do you have any ideas which companies would that be and why?\n\nTo me, the closest I could think of is Cisco (CSCO). They generate huge cash flow, have great balance sheet and pay nice and sustainable dividend. However, this doesn't make them a compunder, but just a nice company to invest in. Their shift from legacy business to Saas could make them one, but only if they are successful in making it a larger part of their revenue. This would increase their earnings power and also make their revenue more predictable, warranting P/E multiple expansion.\n\nI appreciate any feedback :)",

I have been thinking of a couple of different investment strategies, but I'm a rookie so I'd love to get some feedback.\n\n# About me\n\n* Age: Early 20s\n* Location: Europe\n* Investment horizon: Until retirement? \n* Willing to rebalance a couple of times per year, at most\n\n# Potential Strategies\n\nSince I'm fairly young and have a long horizon, I'm willing to take some extra risk at this point. I've spent the last week or so doing analysis and DD on all companies I have considered below. However, I also prefer a fairly simple approach as I'm not planning on conducting DD on too many more companies. The tech focus is deliberate. The strategies I've been thinking about range from relying heavily on ETFs to some stock picking.\n\nMy main question is if you would suggest more of an ETF approach or more stock picking? Which of the strategies would be the best?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Strategy 1|Strategy 2|Strategy 3|Strategy 4|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**ETFs**|VOO, QQQ, VGT|VOO, VGT|VOO, QQQ|VOO|\n|**Stocks**|DIS, BAM, European stocks in Life Sciences and Industrials|DIS, BAM, AMZN, GOOG, FB, PYPL, European stocks in Life Sciences and Industrials|DIS, BAM, MA, European stocks in Life Sciences and Industrials|DIS, BAM, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MA, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, PYPL, European stocks in Life Sciences and Industrials|\n|**Comment**|Keep it as simple as possible.
