        "selftext": "What\u2019s up fellow scallywag\u2019s, it\u2019s ya boy Swaggy with an update on some unusual options activity caught at the end of last week. Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

        "selftext": "**Graf Industrial** $GRAF announced its plan to merge with a maker of laser sensors for self-driving vehicles, Velodyne Lidar. The business has good credentials with over 300 customers including Ford and Mercedes.  Following the merger Ford, Hyundai and Nikon will hold 80% of the stock.  The valuation at 18x revenues is not cheap and reflects 60% annual growth expectations.  Velodyne\u2019s impressive list of backers and customers gives credibility to those forecasts. \n\n**Micron**'$MU reported earnings  that beat expectations with sequential improvement and guided to growth next quarter. Revenues were up 13% while adjusted EPS grew 80%.  It\u2019s the first sequential improvement for six months and a good indicator that the memory chip cycle may be on the turn.  Chip manufacturers have been cutting capacity but now the 5G phone cycle is driving a big increase in DRAM and NAND bits per phone and the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles should also provide a boost.\n\n**My Size** $MYSZ, is a highly speculative mobile device measurement solutions provider for e-commerce fashion.  The company reported this week that two French retail brands, La Pi\u00e8ce and Habillez-moi, are integrating MySizeID into their e-commerce websites in order to increase customer loyalty and reduce returns. My Size offers online retailers innovative measurement and sizing solutions to reduce expensive returns triggered by size errors.  It\u2019s a high risk nanocap with a market capitalization of just $8 million yet has huge potential with its patent protected MySizeID solution that has been licensed by platforms, including Shopify and Lightspeed.  \n\n**Hepion Pharmaceuticals** $HEPA (WARNING SPECULATIVE EARLY STUDY NANO CAP)  jumped on Tuesday after reporting that it was \"exceedingly pleased\" that its CRV431 Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment continues to be very well tolerated throughout the entire Phase 1 program, which well positions Hepion for upcoming Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients.\n\nDr. Robert Foster, CEO of Hepion Pharmaceuticals has said that the drug candidate \"CRV431 offers a novel approach to the treatment of fibrosis caused by NASH and possibly other causes of liver injury,\".  He went on to add \"This is because CRV431 acts, in part, by directly targeting fibrotic scar formation by down-regulating an important regulator of collagen synthesis, cyclophilin B, thereby reducing collagen production. This contrasts with most other NASH drug candidates that target events such as dyslipidemia or diabetes that may lead to fibrosis. Combining the direct antifibrotic actions of CRV431 with the indirect actions of other drug candidates likely represents the best opportunity for rapidly and effectively decreasing liver fibrosis in NASH.\"\n\nThe global Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) market is expected to exceed US$20.0 Billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of more than 10.0% during the period from 2018-2025.  Hepion has a long way to go before approval or commercialization of its drug.  However, with a market cap of just $26 million, even a small chance of developing a successful treatment for such a large prize makes this an interesting stock.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",

        "selftext": "Let\u2019s try and find out. \n\n([Graphs](https://imgur.com/gallery/x0UiCyl))\n\nReferenced TICKERS AMD +69% on the year NVDA +145% on the year INTC +23% on the year \n\nSPECULATION\n\n1. Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n2. They already have the X series CPUs for those who want well binned chips / top silicon. \n3. The consumer CPU market for AMD is now showing long term potential as a profit puppy. \n\u2014\u2014\n[https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results)\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAMD has a strong potential to beat Q3 expected earnings. Why? Because their production has a solid chance of recovering by then. Why? Because they have a somewhat diversified access to memory, and the raw materials needed for production.\n\n[AMD](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/interest_coverage)\n\nAMD - has had a rough go of it, but it\u2019s starting to recover. Yes In the consumers minds, and it\u2019s starting to show in the numbers as well.\n\nDirectly from the post linked above regarding AMD earnings\n\nQ4 2019 Results\n\n\"Revenue of $2.13 billion was up 50 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue was up 18 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment partially offset by lower revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.\"\n\n^ Clearly this is the direction the company is headed in my opinion.\n\n*What are my price targets?\n\nI fully expect AMD to hit ATH of 70$ per share by Q4 or Q1 2021. Why? Because there is demand. Look at what this stock was in feb 2019 and then look at its peak before Covid. Compare that to its current price. See what I\u2019m getting at here?\n\nHas anyone seen the MU surge? Memory is in high demand. Specially flash NVME and SSDs. \n\nWhat does this mean for AMD?\nAMD is heavily dependent on companies like micron (TSMC, Samsung, etc) GDDR6, flash memory, and VRAM are all dependent on this sector.\n\nThe amount of improvement in the memory sector -is staggering. Flash Memory is finally \u201caffordable\u201d to most mid-range computing customers. At the least - far more improvement here than simply PUMPING more GHz into the same cores and SMT that INTC always does. \n\n\n-----\nTLDR: Everyone already hopped on their **** why does this matter now... so what?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. - I can\u2019t speak to how the current market trends will affect this stock in the very short term. \n\nThis is literally a power play - in my opinion - showing how they can adapt to a changing market and their literally competing with theirselves now (just like NVDA competes with itself on its own high end GPUs)",

        "selftext": "hey would some of you savvy investors care to critique me portfolio as well as my approach. I Want this to this to be a long term portfolio which i contribute on a monthly basis. I got in at mid march when things were lowest. I am still a bringer but i found that the covid crash plus all the money I had saved up seemed like a good time to start dabbling.\n\nright now i hold: BA- 4 shares NCHL 99 share, Apple 11 share, RCL 40share- got a really good deal on that, it was trading at near $130 and i got in a $45 ERl- 95 share-again thought this was a steal bc i bought in at 40 and it was trading in the $60 C- 16 shares SYY- 15 share\n\nI bought all these back in mid march along with 1.32 BTC\n\nI understand these are risky and. cruisline may not recover anytime soon so this could lose me a lot of money but im in a position in life which i an afford to take huge hit, so i can learn for next time. phase two of my goal is to reap the benefits of his sale I got with all these stocks-assuming they survive, allocating the money i made from them and use it for my real long term portfolio, which includes:\n\n FAANG -Apple, FB,(debating AMZn bc how expensive the price has gotten at this point, -MFST -Mu -AMD- although ive had a love hate relation shit with AMD -V -JNJ''\n\nwhat doe you guy think if my plan/portfolio effectively, Id like to bring the portfolio to list to 10 manageable companies which i can study in the ins and outs of these companies and mitigated the gambling associated with the list of stock I initially chose\n\nThanks or any and all feed back, Im still a science student in the inventive domain having shifted career path from physics and chemistry.\n\nAny help/brutal criticism is welcome!",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been managing my stock portfolio kinda randomly, some options some stocks buying on a whim and selling. I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my spreadsheet right now:\n\nNewer stars 2 yrs: SE, NET, CRWD, CHWY, FSLY, DDOG, TTD, ZS, TWLO, TEAM, SPLK, MDB, WORK, SHOP\n\nETFs: ARKK, ARKW, WCLD, QQQ\n\nPayments or Banks: SQ, PYPL, V, JPM, BAC \n\nBetting: GAN, DKNG, PENN\n\nChips: NVDA, AMD, MU\n\nEnergy: ENPH, NEE, PCG, FANG\n\nHealthcare: LVGO, TDOC, UNH, MOH, DHR, CATS, VEEV, MODN\n\nCovid: HOLX, NVAX, MRNA, INO, IBIO, AYTU, VBIV , TTOO\n\nEVs: TSLA, NIO, WKHS, FUV, GRAF, PLUG\n\nFANG stocks: MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB\n\nSocial/Entertain: PINS, NFLX, ROKU\n\nCyber: PANW, ZS, CRWD, NET, PING, FNET, FEYE\n\nBeaten down (1 year recovery): WYNN, LVS, DAL, LUV, STWD, SPG, CAR, MAR, RCL\n\nMy Options are:\n1) Invest $10K into 50 stocks since I can\u2019t choose with all the confusion\n2) Choose 15 stocks and invest $30K each or so \n3) Invest more % in couple categories above like the FANG stocks, ETFs, EVs, and less in others \n4) Buy 100 shares of 15 or so from the above list and sell covered calls getting ~$4K per week (but with the limited upside of covered calls, downside will be the same as holding) \n5) Stay 50% or more cash since the market could crash given the high valuations, pandemic and election year \n6) Something else that you\u2019d do in my shoes",

        "selftext": "This week we look at a bullish play in my favorite company in Idaho.  No, not ADM Edible Bean Specialties (Ticker: ADM), but the maker of computer memory, Micron (Ticker: MU).  Tried to find a potato joke, but clearly came up short \\[although the first half of one is at the bottom of the post...\\].  A 6 month chart shows that Micron has recovered much of the March COVID-19 drop, but not all: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[6 Month chart of MU](https://preview.redd.it/9stfq91qavb51.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=726b49ca5f9d5d9ce574b55a73d550c844d1a348)\n\nFurther, we see that historical volatility has come down significantly, but implied volatility remains a good deal higher (Make sure to look at the absolute value of IV as well).  To take advantage, we look to sell some options, in one of two ways:\n\n* Sell 21 August 42.5 puts for 0.51\n* Sell 21 August 45/42.5 put spreads for 0.40\n* Price is at the midpoint as of 7/17/2020\n* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.\n\nIf you want to consider MU as a long term holding, selling a cash secured put will get you in close to $42.  As a pure trade, the put spread offers a nice return on risk if the position expires worthless.  19% for a little over a month ($40/$210 = 19%).  \n\nThere are no earnings during this time frame, which is a benefit to this type of trade (we don't want movement).  \n\nOne risk, as with any placed while the world battles COVID-19, is an overall market drop that takes MU with it, much like what occurred in March.  Here are a couple ways you can offset some of this risk:\n\n* Sell a call spread, like the 55/57.5 for 0.36.  This requires MU to stay within the 45-55 range at expiration and one takes in a total of 0.76 (assuming the put spread is selected)\n* Maintain a smaller position size. Put on less spreads than normal to limit the overall risk to your account.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Better potato jokes than this \"What do you call a potato that has turned to the dark side?\" ....",

        "selftext": "I am seeing a shit load of new treads discussing the following-\n\n1. Fastly vs NET\n2. Hold Fastly or let go?\n3. What does Fastly do? \n\nSo I will clear up a few myths just in case. \n\nFastly is a CDN provider, which allows their clients to host their website on Fastly's servers. Fastly's business model is catered towards large enterprises that are looking at fastest (thus the name!) cold start time, i.e. time it takes to load a webpage on mobile/PC. Here are a few of their clients-\n\n1. **Clients doing very well during Covid**\n\n* Reddit\n* Shopify\n* Wayfair\n* Pinterest\n* Twitter\n* Stripe\n* Overstock\n* Shazam\n* Wealthfront\n* Etsy\n* Tiktok\n\n2. **Clients doing not so well during Covid**\n\n* Airbnb\n* Jetblue\n* Trip Advisor\n* Alaska Air\n* Kayak\n* Yelp\n* Kayak,\n* and many more....\n\nNotice first that their clients that are booming right now are very likely to continue booming for the next year or so. Once we are done with Covid (that is if), revenues will switch to clients in hospitality business, which typically have a strong business during normal times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFastly's USP is fastest cold start time, i.e., it is the best CDN in the market which allows the visitors on their client's website to load the webpage/apps faster than anyone else in the market right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is this USP so important**\\--well there are a few reasons why Fastly will continue to have higher growth rate.  I have noted a few down below-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Apple rolls out 5g iPhone later this year. They will require webpages to load faster. Fastly is the best CDN there is to handle that request. This does not mean that Akamai or NET are sitting out catching honeybee, but really means that Fastly is positioned to serve that switch to 5g better than NET or Akamai IMO.\n2. Fastly's business model is unique. It charges their customers based on the bytes loaded, which translates to the amount of time people spend on their customers' website. Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). Notice that this is a different business model than NET. NET offers a free subscription to begin with and has lower CDN hosting rate for those willing to host on their servers. Therefore, organizations which do not feel that speed is of concern to them as much, prefer to use NET. On the flip side, Fastly has a niche set of customers who value speed, because user experience on their website is of utmost importance to them. Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.\n3. YoY growth based on investor's copy was 62%, which is great if you ask me. As long as it is staying above 50, my money is parked there.\n4. Bergman and Josh raised guidance for this year, during a time when a lot of CFOs are holing on giving guidance. Also of importance is that these folks in the C suite like to give a conservative guidance and beat it. In other words, promise less and deliver more. This leaves no question that next earnings should be a beat but do not take my word on it because who knows what happens tomorrow.\n\n**Influence of Tiktok on Fastly's revenue**\n\nCertainly one of the most important question that needs to be addressed because Tiktok constitutes 12% of the revenues. With the stock dropping like a rock after ER and then earnier today after Donny decided to ban it after 45 days, looks like a lot of the uncertainty is already baked into the price at this moment. Those who were uncertain unboarded the train today. That point is the exhaustion point where bulls come in and drive the stock higher (e.g., Chegg today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally feel that Tiktok MSFT should be a done deal and they are waiting to announce this sometime this month. I am neither an insider nor do I happen to know the actually outcome. However, I do follow hedge fund option sentiment and I have noticed bullish calls inflow for MSFT this past couple days. While I am a peasant who is not connected to anyone involved with the deal, I am sure some of these whales are aware of the decision, which is part of the reason for that bullish call inflow for MSFT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Should you dump FSLY or not?**\n\nEntirely up to you but I see a lot of growth in this company. Fundamentally, nothing has changed in how they operate. The company gave an upward guidance and that drives the stock in forward direction. Some sellers left the ship because a lot of RH investors have not seen losses in their life or some are not even aware of the potential of this company, except it became a meme stock lately and FOMO drove a lot of noobs in FSLY train.\n\nIt is always better to curtail losses. If you trust that they will continue to bring in revenues, I would dollar cost average on every dip. This ensures your average cost of the share is reduced significantly with any dip. Most fund managers actually add stocks to their funds when the stock is sitting at 30 day MA. Fastly had such a quick run up that the 30 day MA kept moving. All of that being said, I think it may rest for some time before beginning the next leg up. That could be a week, 2 weeks, or a month but you will have to be patient if you do not want to loose money. However, never panik sell on a red day because that is literally the day people like me buy from people who are selling. \n\nWould Monday bring a ray of light and we open green-\n\nNo one knows what happens but I would continue to DCA on every 5% drop. I remember when Square dropped a couple years ago, I kept DCAing and here I am sitting on gains. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped convince some of you.",

Is this really a smart approach?\n\nAren\u2019t today\u2019s well established, high growth, low-to-no dividend payout companies likely to be tomorrow\u2019s dividend growth companies? And in the meantime, you\u2019ve gotten a better total return and no taxation?\n\nI feel like, just by loading up on Microsoft, Apple, Visa, and Mastercard today (all of which do pay a (low yield) dividend), you\u2019ve got a good chance of having a very nice dividend income stream in twenty years.",

        "selftext": "# The Trade:\n\nI sold a 1x3 ratio spread 121/116p for a 0.60 credit and a 1x3 ratio spread 122/116p for a 0.25 credit. I exited for a 8.90 credit for a total of 9.75 net profit. Collateral was \\~9k. Breakeven was 400 shares at $113.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvutue3r71h51.png?width=1665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41ede4dd5ad110f5ab3d7c6491db75d80307fe2e\n\n# Strategy:\n\nThis strategy is identical to the [NFLX earnings play I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5ogh9/717_nflx_earnings_play_1x3_short_ratio_put_spread/). I saw that BIDU was consolidating around the 78.6% retracement level for a few days and noticed that it was able to close above it the day before earnings, but on the day of earnings, it sold off and closed well below it. I thought that if BIDU didn't meet earnings expectations, it would sell off. I wanted to make a long play to the downside, but I didn't want to pay to do it, AND if I was wrong, I still wanted to make some money. I chose 116 as my short strike because it was a little bit below the 200 period moving average, and I saw that buyers stepped in at that level a week before. If BIDU were to move to the downside, I was pretty confident that it would move down to the 200 MA, or if it gapped down past it, it would try and test it again or find support at the 50% retracement which is above my breakeven. BIDU closed the day at $116.74.\n\n[Daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/7g5oalp0c1h51.png?width=1684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d392ea63017d9fd48741d0ec0ea63bd6480e8a69)\n\n# Managing the trade:\n\nMy exit strategy for if I was wrong was to roll the puts down and out as far as I can and keep the long puts. I was wrong if BIDU failed to get support at the 50% retracement level ($113.19). BIDU opened above the 200 MA (light blue) and got rejected from it early. I then drew a trend line (purple) from the earnings AH low to the next swing low to see if the market would respect it, and it did. Around 11 AM, BIDU busted through the 200 MA. I waited for a retest and sold the 122p to increase my delta in case it rallied for the rest of the day. I kept the 121p in case it was a false breakout and sure enough, it lost the 200 MA shortly after. I waited for it to get to the purple trendline, and if it lost the trendline, I was going to short shares. Instead, it bounced off of it and danced around the 200 MA before closing at $116.74. I closed my short puts for pennies before close, and exercised my 121p (was hard to get filled) and covered at $117.01.\n\nSomething to note was that I had to manage this trade very closely as my gamma exposure was very high. At one point my position was +500 theta and -150 gamma. I was ready to close at market if there was a sell off.\n\n[5 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/r7x5ozrja1h51.png?width=1827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3ebf2dfdb48ac16646a2f0676cdfa0f4da30920)\n\nPositions and P/L:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtavtuqga1h51.png?width=1832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0243af3b4963ebd4c3935d5ce518d78c98543d06\n\nHope this was interesting!",

        "selftext": "Since everyone has been talking about investing in SQ, I thought maybe we could start an open discussion about the risks of Square the business, whether or not we can continue to expect a skyrocketing share price in the years to come.\n\nI'll point out some things I'm iffy about, would like to get feedback on what you all think. Maybe there's things I'm not aware of.\n\n* Competitors. Square has a good product in an explosive growth industry, but I see their products easily replicable by Apple, Google, and PayPal. Should their business prove to have high demand and margins, there's no doubt FAANG giants will follow. Square has a head start, but do they have a competitive advantage? They have lots of commercial business data atm, but I'm doubtful of the value of that in today's market (more on that in my next point). They're beginning to collect consumer data, but imagine how much more data Visa and Mastercard has over them on that. Their technology is easily replicable by other big companies with enough resources to execute.\n* The limitations of the loan business. One of Square's most promising competitive advantages is that they provide loans to small businesses that show promising growth and room for expansion based on their revenue and profit which is logged into the Square system. There is an undeniable market of unserved small business owners that greatly benefit from this feature, but it's doubtful that this would unleash profits that wouldn't hit a low ceiling most of the time. For example, a hair salon can only purchase so many new salon chairs before they run out of customers to serve within that vicinity. Square could strike gold with a really profitable revolutionary small business, but I don't see why those businesses wouldn't be funded by VC's first before coming to Square. Even if they came to Square first, those businesses are one in a million. I do see Square making profits here, but not profits that would take them out of a niche player role.\n* The limitations of commercial business data. With current data limitations, it's impossible for Square's current technology to be an efficient evaluator of which businesses can achieve explosive growth and which ones will never escape low margins. There are too many non-numerical variables in determining a profitable business. Data technology and AI is not there yet.\n* Personal finance inertia. For Square to disrupt the banking industry, they need some clear advantage over banks. Why should we do the extra work of switching over if we are at an established bank? I'm not saying Square wouldn't be a better option than a traditional bank, but it takes a lot to turn the tide in an industry as conservative as the banking industry.\n\nFeel free to refute any of these concerns, maybe there's something really compelling to Square that I'm not seeing. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know.",

Also, the company\u2019s plans in FL (doubling capacity, expanding the # of stores by \\~40%), offer further optionality upside (edibles later this year; rec 2-3 years out). We think all these factors, plus ongoing deregulation, will continue to push the valuation multiple higher; Curaleaf trades at 20x CY21 EBITDA vs. 17x for OW-rated GTBIF and CRLBF.

Therefore, I will stop doing that and just post some of the top tickers suggested by the tool here with my little DD on top. I hope the community here will like that more. No BS, let's go to the charts.\n\n# Bearish Watchlist\n\n**$GE** \\-&gt; This has been in a good downtrend plus we have a descending triangle now. Put volume today was about  38.8K while Call volume was only about 7.8K. If this breaks the current support, expecting it to go down a bit before settling. [https://i.imgur.com/lyiyyoC.png](https://i.imgur.com/lyiyyoC.png)\n\n**$CRBP** \\-&gt; Very risky play but the price action seems okay for a bearish play. Decent resistance at 7.25 and if that's not crossed, expecting more downward movement. However, the company has some drugs in the pipeline, not a longer term play at all. [https://i.imgur.com/574V5M1.png](https://i.imgur.com/574V5M1.png)\n\n**$MAC** \\-&gt; Like this one. The trend line doesn't seem too controversial, it's clear. The price has touched it 4 times. If it doesn't go above it, good bearish setup. [https://i.imgur.com/uQ22bGX.png](https://i.imgur.com/uQ22bGX.png)\n\n**$SNAP** \\-&gt; This broke the long term up trend a few days ago by going below both 20 and 50 MA. As long as it doesn't cross the MAs again, good bearish setup. [https://i.imgur.com/6QXaKWV.png](https://i.imgur.com/6QXaKWV.png)\n\n# Bullish Watchlist\n\n**$BABA** \\-&gt; I love this stock. Posted a bullish prediction for this about a week or two ago and it has started to gain some momentum, decent setup as long as some bad news don't drop :P [https://i.imgur.com/6UfdvEe.png](https://i.imgur.com/6UfdvEe.png)\n\n**$AAPL** \\-&gt; Very risky. The last time there was a triangle, the price went up pretty nicely after breaking it. Let us see how it does now. [https://i.imgur.com/xXQ4lIw.png](https://i.imgur.com/xXQ4lIw.png)\n\n**$DOCU** \\-&gt; Price is above 20 MA again. Good support at 204 level for an entry. This seems like a slightly longer term hold [https://i.imgur.com/NCBmCrs.png](https://i.imgur.com/NCBmCrs.png)\n\nWould love to hear everyone's thoughts.

        "selftext": "So we've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$AAPL, $MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.\n\nThe tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.\n\nBullish    means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current     close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$ILMN** \\- Bullish probability of 88.43%. I know this dropped hard today but the tool is bullish on it. If it starts to go back, it will be a good setup. If it continue going down, don't get in. **Risky setup, careful!**\n\n**$NVAX** \\- Bullish probability of 77.14%. I like that it dropped today. Either get in if it touches the support at $160 and bounces back or get in on a pull back at the moving averages ([https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png](https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png))\n\n**$LULU** \\- Bullish probability of 74.80%. Seems like a good setup, especially with a small pullback ([https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png](https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png))\n\n**$FSLY** \\- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This dropped right at its 50 MA. A good setup as long as the price stays above 50MA ([https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png](https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png)). Exit otherwise.\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$BAC** \\-  Bearish probability of 86.76%. I like it for a bearish setup if it can below the support of $25.2 ([https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png)).\n\n**$ZNGA** \\-  Bearish probability of 83.96%. This is at a very strong support level at $9.9. **Do not get in unless it breaks the support** ([https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png)).\n\n**$GILD** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.68%. Might go up a bit before going down further. Healthcare stocks are risky though so be careful.\n\n**$WDC** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.66%. Only a good setup if price stays below the support level of $37.8 ([https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png](https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png))\n\n \n\n**Note:**  A lot of time has gone into these tools and it takes time to write  these alerts, look at    charts, and post them here. Would love for you  guys to **try out our** [discord](https://discord.gg/X2hHeJ) **channel** where I post alerts from various tools, not just the options one. Please hit me up if you want to link, it's free to join.\n\n**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.**",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, here's a trade I made on NFLX that I wanted to share with you guys. I wasn't able to post it then because I was banned: \n\nI sold a 1x3 ratio put spread 510/485p for a 4.80 credit (7/16 12 PM PST) and exited for a 16.80 net credit. Collateral: \\~17k.\n\n# Strategy:\n\nThe idea behind my strategy was that since NFLX ran pretty hard into earnings and had an impulsive selloff on 7/13, there was room for it to move to the downside if earnings didn't meet expectations. I wanted to make a long play to the downside, but I didn't want to pay to do it, AND if I was wrong, I still wanted to make some money. I chose the 485 as my short strike because it was a little bit below the 20 period moving average; I saw that it has been far above it for multiple days and had a lot of reactions on it. If NFLX were to move to the downside, I was pretty confident that it would move down to the 20 MA, or if it gapped down past it, it would at least try and test it again.\n\n# Managing the trade:\n\nMy exit strategy for if I was wrong was to roll the puts down and out as far as I can and keep the long put. I knew I was wrong if I saw that NFLX could not capture the 20 MA. I exited my position early for this trade for a few reasons: I saw that it was consolidating and could make a big move to the downside or upside soon, because it is monthly OPEX (potential for more volatility), have work to do and didn't want to have to be tied to my trading app, and because this was more leverage than I was comfortable with for my account size. Normally I have multiple units for trades (so like a 2x6, or 3x9) and take profits along the way.\n\nOrder: [https://imgur.com/a/Mh0iyhT](https://imgur.com/a/Mh0iyhT)\n\nDaily chart: [https://imgur.com/a/0TCtB0v](https://imgur.com/a/0TCtB0v)\n\nToday's 5 minute chart: [https://imgur.com/a/pkkc9FH](https://imgur.com/a/pkkc9FH)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this was interesting!",

        "selftext": "I want to discuss my strategy with you my beloved redditors and get some opinions for inspiration.\n\nPersonal situation: 30 yo married no kids\nI am a lawyer in germany. My wife has a very advanced understanding of work life balance and works only 24/h. She doesnt excpect me to work more then her. She values sparetime. Im totaly fine with it. I just have higher materialistic goals then her. \n\nI am working for 1 year now and i am partner in a small chancellery.\n\nTotal income after taxes wife (21k \u20ac) me (50k): 61k/y or 5k/m\nCost of living per month: 1.4k \n\nWe are both very ecenomical and are sitting a house at the beach till the summer of 2023 which allows us to only pay 300\u20ac/m of rent.\n\nMy goal is to be financialy free (1.5m in stocks + maybe 2-3 flats for renting to tourists) at the age of 50 with a payed off house. We want to build the house in 2022 so we can move in in 2023. \n\nOur house will cost us aproximatly 800k-900k. Its expensive here at the beach but we want the quality of life not to go down.\n\nI dont care about prestige. I will drive used cars worth 5k forever. If i have to show off in front of clients i rent a car or use the car of one of my partners and pay them something.\n\nIn 2019 we both finished the law exams and started working in august 2023.\n\nWe started with 10k cash 1 year ago. Started investing in Dec 2019.\n\nPortfolio:\n\n20k Cash\n\n40k stocks\n\nMSFT 12k (up 10%)\n\nAmzn 9k (up 72%)\n\nGoogl 6k (up 3%)\n\nMA 6k (up 13%)\n\nJPM 2k (down 5%)\n\nINTC 5k (down 17%)\n\nOPTION A: \nWe have the chance to buy a 71sqm flat 100m from the beach for 250k. Its build in 1970 and we need to invest 50k to make it a modern and flooded with light. \n\nMy father is an architect. He can help us for free. The price is ok'ish in this overheated market.\n\nOur plan is to use the flat as a vacation rental. This would pay for mortgage and all expenses and leave ~ 100 \u20ac/m of free cash flow. We can rent it for 150\u20ac/d in the summertime. I expect 160 booked days per year.\n\nPos: \n-we  create a steady small income stream\n- after 20 years we payed off the mortgage and have a nice asset\n- we use debt to create wealth which ensures we dont suffer under a possible hyperinflation in our allocation phase before we invest our money into our own house\n\nCons:\n- additional effort for renting the flat  via airbnb\n- i would have to sell all my stocks right now\n- risk of things like roof damage and other unforseen things\n- all savings are bound in the flat\n- maybe not enough savings until we plan to buy our own property in 2022\n- my own inexperience concerning this matter\n\nOPTION B:\n\nWe dont buy the flat and keep investing 1k/ month in etfs waiting for a nice entry points like in march and save up via this way until we buy our property.\n\nI am interested in your comments! \nSry for my bad english skills. \n\nHave a nice saturday",

        "selftext": "Buffetology was a book written by his son's ex-wife afaik. She just explained Buffets approach there. \n\nWithout going too much into detail: He's into stocks whose companies have some kind of monopoly. Those companies should have a business that does not need them to invest too much in new machines and stuff. \n\nSome of the stocks there mentioned were Coca Cola, Nike or Visa and Mastercard. Everyone knows Coca Cola, it's wherever you go and they don't need to be innovative or something. It's something that will always exist. There are other drinks too, but Coca Cola has the \"monopoly\". They can continue doing what they were doing the last decades because there is no need to invest in new machines or method.\n\nVisa and Mastercard just receive money for every transaction that was made. Visa has like 20 000 workers all over the world, which is not much for such a big company. No need to invest in any new factories, machines etc. People just continue using it. \n\nIf you look at their long term charts you can see they are crisis-resistant. \n\nThe question is, what are some upcoming branches or companies, that could have similar characteristics? \n\nI like NEXCF so far. I don't know much about their rivals or if they have any besides WIMI. They produce Augmented Reality stuff. Apple etc. are no direct competitors because NEXCF's app integrates all the things like Skype, Zoom etc. in their app. It's a young company. I just hope, within the next 10 years or so they can be as much worth as Zoom etc. \nI think they could have a \"monopoly\" like this in the future. But we will see. \n\nSomething I failed to get in the past was Activision Blizzard. They were like 9 bucks back then and are over 60, 10 years later. Again, the video game industry is big but they have some kind of monopoly either. Just look at the games. WoW, Diablo, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Call of Duty. Wish I had bought it back then. \n\nAnother hope I have is Leyou. They are famous for Free to Play games, their most famous one is Warframe. They are currently working with Amazon Games on a Lord of the Ring MMO. Hopefully they can create someday in the future with the new console generation the new Fortnite or something. They are currently in talks with Tencent for a takeover. \n\nIn Buffetology is also written, that you should search for stocks in fields that you know about. Such as gaming. What's a potential \"monopoly\" company in your field?",

        "selftext": "Hello! Would really appreciate if I could get your feedback on my current portfolio / any advice on how to improve :)\n\nA bit of background on myself: I am 29 years old from Singapore and had put in about half my savings into 'safe' Singapore stocks pre-COVID (mainly local banks and the STI ETF) because my friends / family recommended that I do this (instead of leaving my money in the bank) years back when I was just starting out and had absolutely 0 knowledge about investing. I am currently down about US$11k but plan to keep the $ in for long term anyway.\n\nOnly at the height of COVID, some time in March, did I turn my attention to overseas exchanges (big regret starting so late). Since then I have pumped in about US$85k and to date I am up around US$14k overall. I mainly started with small positions to test the waters but added to my positions / bought new stocks over the last 4 months.\n\nThis is my current portfolio w rough stock weightage:\n\nSE 21% FVRR 13% PINS 8% NIO 7% TCEHY 7% AMZN 4% NFLX 4% BABA 3% GOOGL 3% FB 2% PDD 2% JD 2% ATVI 2% DIS 2% WDAY 2% MA 2% XOM 2% BP 2% V 1% MCD 1% AIR 1% KO 1% HLT 1% MAR 1% CINE 1% CCL 1% NCLH 1% DAL 1% PLAY 1% UAA 1%\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n* I know I have far too many stocks and am spread WAY too thin... have been wanting to trim and consolidate for a while. Admittedly I didn't really know what I was doing at the beginning and just bought small positions in many stocks :'(\n* I got greedy and bought some really bad stocks during the early June offline rally (i.e. airlines, cruises and PLAY) and I am kicking myself now. But hoping not to sell off any at a loss if possible to hold longer and wait for spikes\n* I am extremely bullish on tech, esp e-comm (clearly), mainly because I have been working in this industry and closely following big tech since I graduated from uni. Witnessed and experienced first-hand the rapid growth of e-comm in Southeast Asia and am very aware of the untapped potential. Unfortunately I had neither the foresight nor the gall to buy these stocks earlier\u2026\n* All the money I have invested has been accrued from years of working, saving, and being stingy lol + profits from a small e-comm side business I run -- none from my parents!",

        "selftext": "This was posted on one of the Facebook Groups.  I figured I would copy it and share it here.  I have not seen this ticker mentioned on this board before.  Low Flow stock, but does not appear to be any active pump and dump going on.  Seems like this may be starting on an uptrend to fill some gaps.  \n\n\"NeuroMetrix, Inc., (NURO) is a healthcare company that develops and  markets products for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of  peripheral nerve and spinal cord disorders. One of their more  interesting products is Quell, a wearable device for relief of chronic  intractable pain, such as nerve pain due to diabetes and lower back  problems.   The company offers its products to consumers, retail  merchandisers, direct response TV promoters, health care professionals,  managed care organizations, endocrinologists, podiatrists, physicians,  neurologists, and physical medicine and rehabilitation centers, as well  as primary care, internal medicine, orthopedic, hand, and neurosurgeons.   While operating out of out of Woburn, MA. NeuroMetrix has a presence  in Europe, Japan, China, the Middle East, and Mexico. The company has a  strategic collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. NeuroMetrix, Inc. was  founded in 1996.\n\nWhy do I like this play?  Well, there is no  pending catalyst.  Truthfully, the company has had some problems in the  past few years, but a reverse split and a few other moves have the stock  price moving in a favorable direction.  So, yes - - this is more of a  chart play...and I do love the chart. \n\nNeuroMetrix gained 4.65%  in the last trading day (Friday, 7th Aug 2020), rising from $2.15 to  $2.25 , and has now gained 3 days in a row. This is a LOW FLOW stock  (3.75m), so it can really move if volume takes over.  For example,  during daily trading it  fluctuated 7.08% from a day low at $2.12 to a  day high of $2.27.  The price has risen in 6 of the last 10 days and is  up by 14.21% over the past 2 weeks. Volume has increased in the last day  along with the price, which is a positive technical sign, and, in  total, 186 thousand more shares were traded than the day before. In  total, 722 thousand shares were bought and sold for approximately $1.62  million.\n\nIt will be exciting to see whether it manages to continue gaining or take a minor break for the next few days\n\n But looking more at the chart, one reason it has risen is the lack of  strong resistance. On a 4 HR chart the 9MA has crossed the 100 MA and  the stock began trading in confirmation this past week.  NURO blew past  resistence levels around 2.16.  The next resistence levels are low  $2.40s and high $2.50s.  After that, there is a big gap to fill before  getting to $3.35 and $6.20.   I am a big fan of \u201cU-Shaped\u201d charts that  fill gaps and I suspect that NURO is on that path. \"\n\nI am going to get in on this.  I like the upside potential. Anyone have any experience with this ticker or thoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5v6xtg43vzf51.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd7f12136a445f8ef81827dab041d39fbe508627",

        "selftext": "I'm a 21 year old university student, and have been saving money for the past several years. I have never invested in anything (I literally only have a chequing account), but have been trying to do research these past few weeks to understand my investment options better, and thought I'd see what advice I could get from this sub. I've saved around $30k and have no debt/expenses, and am looking to invest $10-15k. First I'd ask do you think this is a reasonable investment amount given the context? \n\nOverall, I'm looking for long term, \"relatively safe\" investments, but since I'm also OK with taking some risk. I've become interested in stocks/trading, and am particularly attracted to dividends. So far, I've made a list of 10-15 stocks I'd be interested in investing in which are: GOOGL, AMZN, AAPL, COST, JNJ, JPM, MA, MSFT, PG, RY, TD, V, and WMT. I'm looking to distribute the money fairly evenly (around $1k per stock).\n\nThe reason I chose these is because I think they are very established companies with good histories (yes, I know past performance isn't a guarantee of future results), I think there's decent diversity as a starting point for a portfolio (13 stocks - tech, retail, banking), and in my opinion these companies are well managed and have good future prospects. Some of my general questions: \n\n1. Do these stocks seem like a good foundation? \n\n2. Am I way wrong by starting off with stocks, and should I be investing elsewhere? \n\n3. Am I too young/inexperienced for stocks? \n\n4. Would I be better off investing in ETFs? \n\n5. How do ETF returns compare to possible returns from these stocks? \n\n6. Should I be looking to invest in things like S&amp;P500 Index, DJI, and NASDAQ Composite? \n\nI'm also open to any general pieces of investment advice you'd be willing to give. All comments are appreciated, and thanks for reading!",
