        "selftext": "Yo.  This is maybe the weirdest thing ever, but I am the original creator of  the baby that was plagiarized for your old logo which I guess was  recently changed. I'm currently quarantined like everyone else so I  figure now's as good a time as any to meet n greet and what not. AMA.\n\nIf  you're not aware, the basis for your (old) logo came from an  educational animation I made 8 years ago for TedEd, about moles. Here it  is: [How big is a mole?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEl4jeETVmg) (the relevant drawing can be found around the 3:20 mark). Also, here is a [gif.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y0O9TgOM9hoBy/giphy.gif)\n\n[and here's proof if you care i guess.](https://imgur.com/a/PwuxN4Y)\n\nI  came across this sub randomly while scrolling years ago and basically  did a double take, since the logo (with hair and different color suit)  was not drawn by me, it was pretty clearly copied from the TedEd  animation and I recognized it anyway. I had no idea what to do with the  information that an old piece of art I made was plagiarized and being  used for a logo of a sub whose purpose I can't quite understand, so I  just kept it to myself as a weird thing that happened.\n\nSomeone  alerted me to the fact that the logo has recently been changed, and tbh  I was kinda bummed lol. I feel compelled to state that legally I don't  own the original artwork, that would be TedEd, so if it was flagged for  copyright I can't help you. but if it were up to me you'd have my  blessing.",

        "selftext": "If you're not in bear gang, it's not too late to join, and I suggest you do so promptly because shits about to hit the fan frens. That being said, I plan on riding the \"V\" down and up on this one, and lastly, if you're a perma bull you're in luck I've got some companies at the bottom that I think will go up over the next few months.\n\n**What's about to happen:**\n\nLet's stick to the facts and correlate this puppy to a similar outbreak; H1N1: \"*From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus... Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated* \" [\\[1\\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html)\n\nSince H1N1 got memory holed and everybody forgot about it, the virus became a modern flu, we have flu shots for this thing and chances are you've probably had it at one point or another -- it's just one of the flues that floats around each season. But the Corona is different...\n\nFirst off, this thing already has a reproduction rate higher than any of the previous outbreaks in the last 150 years [\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics). AND it's one of the most deadly -- however only to certain age groups which is a big difference [\\[4\\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). Now I do want to make it clear that the Spanish Flu was a lot deadlier to healthy adults, also the age demographics have changed. StatsCanada actually has a good tool that shows the population pyramid and you can compare Spanish Flu in 1918 to 2020 and it'll have some similar-ish results to the USA [\\[5\\]](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/pyramid/pyramid.cfm?type=1&amp;geo1=01). There's also population pyramid tool here for the USA but it only goes back to 1950 [\\[6\\]](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/). \n\nBuddy of mine with access to a Bloomberg terminal sent this to me the other day which tracks the spread of the Corona virus [\\[7\\]](https://imgur.com/a/O4J6cuc). Think the code is 'Map Virus' or something. What matters is that we can see a very obvious trend of exponential growth, in fact that's how you model these things... This thing will spread like wildfire once it starts to hit the cities in America, and... already has. [All it takes is one 'chad spreader'](https://imgur.com/a/N542fqR) to jump on the subway and it'll be a matter of weeks and the entire city is infected. In fact it's already happened in Toronto so buy puts on $CANADA [\\[8\\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/).\n\nWhat matters is that we can see that something like \\~60.8 million people who got H1N1 in the USA from 2009 to 2010 and this thing had an r0 of only like \\~1.5ish. The bat soup virus currently has an estimated r0 at \\~2.4 right now, mind you this is a number that varies through time and can decrease by human intervention (such as quarantines of cities), which will inevitably transpire... \n\nIf we assume that this thing spreads with even some level of similarity to H1N1 in 2009, this is going to be a bloodbath for the boomers. First and foremost, this will spread at a much higher rate among boomers and those in old folks homes, we've got evidence of that already [\\[9\\]](https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-stalls-cruise-ship-off-california/).\n\nBut that's not all. Italy is fucked. They just announced a quarantine of 1/4 of their fucking population [\\[10\\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70). Take wild guess how that's going to fare for their economy. The FTSE MIB is down shy of 20% from it's highs as it stands right now and its only going to get worse [\\[11\\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/i945?countrycode=it). Given that the Italy  is basically a leading indicator of what's going to happen in the USA...  I fucking DARE YOU to buy spy calls.\n\nSo let's get to the nuts and bolts of this. Some autist named Dr. James Lawler stated that worst case scenario this thing could infect 96m in the USA and kill 480,000 people [\\[12\\]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-dr-james-lawler-warning-us-hospitals-infection-a9385031.html). However, funny enough his estimates are based on a mortality rate of 0.5%. The current mortality rate is \\~3.5% so, rather, we could be looking at up to 3,360,000 dying in the USA if the mortality rate is what it currently is.\n\nHowever, we can math this based on the population pyramids I posted above. In the USA if we take the known mortality rates and population pyramid and transpose that on the worst case scenario, we're looking at shy 1.9m dead (mostly older people) given that 30% get the virus in the next year [\\[13\\]](https://imgur.com/a/vfOz0Nf). If this spreads at the same rate as H1N1, then we're looking at a total of \\~60.8 million infected in a year's time. This corresponds to \\~18.6% of the population getting it and would result in \\~1.16m people dead [\\[14\\]](https://imgur.com/a/WUDaMza). \n\nNow, I'm willing to bet that my boy Donnie isn't interested in losing a massive chunk of his voting block so I'm betting that we see quarantines very soon in the USA, entire cities shut down just like we've seen in China and just like we've seen in Italy and Iran. It's going to happen and when it does, the lemmings will be shocked. I mean, this shouldn't come as a surprise, there's already runs on toilet paper in Australia over this thing [\\[15\\]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/australians-scrap-toilet-rolls-coronavirus-panic-buying-200308014116516.html). \n\nAnyways, I think we'll get a cure eventually and that everybody reading this will be fine, in fact I'm not a doomer whatsoever. Society will continue on and SPY will eventually recover and I'll join bull gang again, but I'm sure Monday will be a bloodbath after Italy quarantined like 16 million people.\n\nBut back to my point, just think about what'll happen to SPY when a US city announces a quarantine. They're already preparing for it by declaring states of emergency now [\\[16\\]](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-202-declaring-disaster-emergency-state-new-york). The fear will be real and it already is...\n\nSo how do we profiteer from this? And what will inevitably transpire?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI know half of you retards skipped to here but kudos to the champions that read everything I wrote. \n\n1) General stock market decline, puts on $SPY or high beta stocks if IV isn't too high\n\n2) for my perma-bull frens, calls on funeral home and burial companies: $SCI, $CSV, $MATW, $PLC:CA, $DTY:UK, etc.\n\n3) Puts on old folks care homes because those are probably going to be vacant here very shortly and thus less cash flows to investors... stocks like: $WELL, $VTR $OHI, etc.\n\n4) I'm still bearish airlines and travel... I mean go look at the chart of $AAL. After 9/11 that stock went from $40 a share to literally $2 a share... in 2003. The same thing happened during the GFC, stock again went from over $40 a share to a fucking penny stock -- traded at like $0.30 per share. Get ready for round 3... I look forward to buying calls on airlines after this is all over.\n\n5) bearish any developing country/emerging market ETF's. They're going to get hit hard.\n\n6) I don't know anything about medical or medical research stocks but calls and puts on companies researching corona virus cure. Again... correct me if I'm wrong but to my understanding it's zero-sum, the company that gets a solid cure makes bank and the rest are fucked but again idk this isn't my area whatsoever. Also looks like a lot of these stocks are rocketing and IV is massive so I'm sitting on the sidelines on this one\n\nIf you're from r/all wanting to get in on the tendies, I saved a special one just for you! Go all in on $LVS 80C 3/13 calls, trust me. Cannot go tits up.",

        "selftext": "I believe this is the largest black swan event anyone alive has seen. It will have dramatic health and market/financial consequences that vastly undervalued. Below is my rationale for that thesis. \n\n1. In 2009 H1N1 infected 1/5 of the world population (crazy, right?) due to its airborne transmission characteristic but ended up having a very low mortality rate of 0.02% as humanity\u2019s general influenza antibodies proved very effective. \n\n2. COVID19 spreads more effectively than H1N1 through airborne transmission and 2x incubation period. Unlike H1N1 influenza, people have no have antibody defense for this strain of coronavirus - hence the novel nomenclature. The purported 1-4% death rate would be the most deadly virus to spread in the last 100 years and upwards of 200 million could theoretically die. \n\n3. The virus is insidiously effective because it A) Does not cause large complications/illness in most people so they go about their life and spread continues; B) in the portion of the population it does seriously affect - it is serious serious, with numbers indicating 10ish% of infections require hospitalization and ventilator support. There is no healthcare system on the planet that can accommodate this, the system will get overwhelmed. \n\n4. The social distancing protocol that China put in place is almost unfathomable. 1.5 billion people have largely not left their apartment in 6 weeks other than to buy food periodically. This is why new numbers are declining but based on 1 and 2 this is just temporary and the virus will inevitably spread again. The virus is incapable of being \u201ccontained\u201d. Extreme social distancing a la China might buy time until the 12 month lead time for a vaccine arrives but this would decimate economies. \n\n5. China style social distancing is impossible outside of China and smaller dictatorships but governments will impose and people will begin self imposing smaller versions. Expect to see March Madness, Coachella, etc all canceled and any business that is able move to work from home. \n\n6. The economy at the end of the day is driven by end consumer consumption of goods and services, often provided by small mom and pop businesses. Those speaking of a v shaped recovery are non sensical. A drastic month to multi-month drop in cash flow will tip over many of businesses and they will not meet obligations such as payroll. Your neighborhood burger joint can\u2019t fall back on its strong balance sheet and wait for the V/U.\n\n7. 6 will lead to recession and a domino effect through the economy. Where 08 was a top down driven recession this one will be bottom up. It being bottoms up also means it more resistant to the few monetary policy tools we have come accustomed to using. There will be a complete shakeout in the economy as we physiologically grapple with what this virus is going to mean and what things will look like when it is over. Once people start to understand that people they know will die things will get even more panicky. \n\n8. The world will recover and economies bounce back but we are in for a ride that has largely only been text book theoretical before this. Buckle up.",

The event will sell tickets to host a live audience of approximately 2,500 people, and will also be live streamed, available online through pay-per-view.\n\nYou can learn more about it by visiting **[wallstreetbets.net](https://wallstreetbets.net)**\n\n#**Why will it be in Texas?**\n\nESA is the newest and biggest Esports venue in the US.  It\u2019s a facility that was built specifically for esports and has all the latest technology and infrastructure which is needed to host this type of event. \n\n#**Is it real**?\n\nYes.  Here are some reputable news sources that have written about it:\n\n* [Nobody Wants a Margin Call Right Now]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-03-26/money-stuff-nobody-wants-a-margin-call-right-now) - Bloomberg (by Matt Levine)\n\n* [Esports Stadium Arlington to Host Stock Options Trading Championship]( https://esportsobserver.com/esports-stadium-arlington-wsb) \u2013 Esports Observer\n\n* [Wild markets set stage for winner-take-all trading competition]( https://www.investmentnews.com/wild-markets-trading-competition-190598) - Investment News\n\n* WSB Announces First Live Trading Championship \u2013 (Press Release) found on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wallstreetbets-announces-first-live-trading-110000567.html), [AP](https://apnews.com/Business%20Wire/44bde858888d487c85e29a442c1ede6a), [Street Insider](https://www.streetinsider.com/Business+Wire/WallStreetBets+Announces+First+Live+Trading+Championship/16665169.html), [Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/WallStreetBets-Announces-First-Live-Trading-Championship--30256362/), [BusinessWire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200326005099/en/WallStreetBets-Announces-Live-Trading-Championship), [Digital Journal](http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/4633412), [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/20/03/b15670385/wallstreetbets-announces-first-live-trading-championship)\n\n#**How will the contestants be picked? How can I apply?**\n\nWe will open up contestant applications in the coming weeks along with any requirements (relevant citizenship, 18 years old, etc\u2026).  At that point we will also list out the rules and criteria which will used for the selection.  There will be \u201cqualifier rounds\u201d which will be fully transparent and open to the public to watch.  At the end of the process, we will have the final contestants for the WSB Championship.\n\nContestants will deposit a predetermined amount of money into a personal broker account which will be used for the competition.  Anything they make (or lose) during the competition will be theirs, in addition to the prize money awarded to the winner.\n\n#**What\u2019s the prize?**\n\nThe prize will be big, between 6 and 7 figures.  The final amount will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n#**How are you paying for it?**\n\nThe prize money is coming from the primary sponsor of the event, [True Trading Group]( https://truetradinggroup.com/wallstreetbets/?cc=WSBTTG&amp;cp=30).  This has been mentioned in all the press releases linked above:  \n&gt; True Trading Group (TTG) will provide the proceeds for the WSB Championship prize.\n\n#**What about the beer virus?**\n\nWe\u2019re seriously hoping that COVID-19 is under control by October, in which case we will proceed with the live audience.  But if there are any sort of restrictions in place by then, the entire event will also be streamed online.\n\n#**Do you have a lawyer?**\n\nYes.  Many of them.\n\n#**You\u2019re going to get options banned for everyone**\n\nDerivative market is 17 times greater than the actual equities market.  Estimated to be around $1.2 quadrillion dollars globally (although not all with options).  If 12 people get together and legally trade them for a couple days shuts down that market, then the financial system has bigger problems on its hands than WSB. \n\n#**You\u2019re drawing too much attention to WSB, the world will find out we exist now!**\n\nWe\u2019ve been on the world\u2019s [radar](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-millennials-looking-to-get-rich-or-die-tryin-off-one-of-wall-streets-riskiest-oil-plays-2016-03-30) for [some](https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/a-guy-on-reddit-turns-1-122-into-almost-158-000-with-two-trades-20191018-p531tw.html) time [now](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fernandoalfonso/2019/05/30/wolf-of-reddits-wall-street-bets-is-bullish-on-irreverent-video-mashups/#4db9ecf416d0).  People on WSB have been worried about the [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) effect since 2012, and I don\u2019t blame them.

The fact is we have a big mod team and they do all sorts of things behind the scenes (and a terrific job at that) to make sure the sub quality stays on par with its growth rate.  \n\n#**STFU and change the logo!** \n\nI hear you, we\u2019re fixing the logo.

        "selftext": "I finally had time this week to do coronavirus research and the number that sticks out the most on coronavirus in the US is 1,583.  That's the number of people the CDC has tested in the US so far.  Even if you include state-level testing, the numbers probably don't reach more than 3,500.  (Many have been tested multiple times, so the total number of tests is around 6k).\n\nThat's extremely worrisome at this stage.  Virtually every other country with 100+ cases has run many times the number of tests that the US has run, and those countries all have far greater testing capability at the moment.  The only country that's handling this as poorly as the US right now is Iran; that's bad company to be in...\n\nThe US is at least 2 full weeks behind the curve on coronavirus in my opinion, and that means markets are 2 weeks behind the curve on coronavirus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean for markets?  It means that there's real potential for the US outbreak to get much worse, and we have no real idea how bad the actual situation is here.\n\nThere's only 2 scenarios here: \n\n1) That there's no major outbreak in the US beyond what we've seen, and we experience a quick V-shaped recovery in markets in 2 weeks when we've run 50k+ tests and the number that test positive is only around 1k by then.\n\n2) After we dramatically increase testing over the next 2 weeks, we start to see positive test numbers escalate dramatically (approaching several hundred or 1k+ a day), and we start to see business activity dramatically decline in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we're far more likely to be in the 2nd scenario right now because of how thoroughly this has been mismanaged by US authorities; the US should've been ramping up testing weeks ago to try to squelch this.  We should have had 20k+ tests done by now.  Due to that deficiency, we're much closer to needing a Chinese-style shutdown of major cities to actually halt this by April/May.\n\nHow to trade this? There are likely to be more dead cat bounces because investors have been programmed the past decade to believe \"STONKS ONLY GO UP\" (like this past week which was a giant dead cat bounce), and I'd load up puts into those if we don't see testing numbers increase fast.  Every day that we're not testing much larger numbers of people is another day that we fall behind the curve and make the eventual scope of the problem worse (see Iran).\n\nAnd here's the kicker, fresh off the Florida press: \"Gov. DeSantis says one of the Broward coronavirus cases is a person who worked at Port Everglades checking people in for a cruise line.\" \n\n  \nTL;DR: It's way easier to see SPY 250 than SPY 350 in the market's immediate future.",

        "selftext": "Yesterday, it was reported that 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment in the past week. This number dwarfed official expectations (about 1 million) as well as any previous figures ever reported, including during the Great Recession.\n\nThere is also good reason to believe that this number does not even capture all of those who lost their livelihoods in the last seven days. A combination of confusion, bad information, and bureaucracy, coupled with the fact that many of these Americans will be filing for the first time, means that the number laid off may be much higher.\n\nYet, in the hours after the announcement, the US equities market rallied 4 percent, extending a three day \u201cwinning streak,\u201d as many of those in the business would call it.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: there are no winners to be declared in the midst of this crisis.\n\nThe President has been quick to express hope for a fast economic re-opening. Wall Street has been continually calling out for a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, or a quick rebound off of a bottom. A string of hedge fund managers, politicians, and pundits appear on television and in our Twitter feeds daily, reassuring us of what is possible.\n\nFinancial markets, with little left to grasp onto, have clung to this sentiment. Deep breaths. It will all be okay. This too shall pass. Thoughts and prayers.\n\n\"**IN 2008, BANKS WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED. THIS WAS REALLY THE ROOT OF THE SYSTEMIC FAILURE THAT OCCURRED. THIS TIME, IT IS HOSPITALS THAT ARE OVERCAPACITY.** \"\n\nEconomists, analysts and big bank CEOs tell us that there is nothing to fear because this time is different from 2008. This time there is no risk of systemic failure.\n\nThere are three points I would like to raise in light of this argument:\n\n**1. Dismissing risk of systemic failure is premature.** \n\nSystemic failure is almost by definition hard to discern ahead of time or even in the moment. It is nearly impossible to accurately forecast the cascade of downstream effects.\n\nVery few have the privilege of a bird\u2019s eye view perspective in any given crisis. We are more likely to be foot soldiers in the fog of war than generals drawing battle lines. Therefore, it is devilishly difficult to see how a systemic failure will develop and affect other parts of the system as well as other systems altogether.\n\nEven those who are in a position to see it all, often do not. Like the general in his bunker, it is too easy to become disconnected from reality on the ground.\n\nBanks are well capitalized this time, so from the perspective of the financial system, *that particular systemic risk* appears to no longer be relevant. But there are plenty of other cracks that are currently coming under pressure. Notably, central bankers globally have few conventional options left to stimulate growth as they have pursued nothing but easy monetary policies for the last decade.\u00a0\n\n**2. When the foundation itself is crumbling, a cascade of systemic failures is unnecessary to bring down the structure.**\n\nIt is a known phenomenon that political leaders rely on comfortable, old fashioned frameworks when confronting novel\u00a0 crises. American and European leaders demonstrated this in the 1950s and 1960s, turning to World War II paradigms as they confronted a geopolitical landscape in which that thinking no longer applied. The same can be said of American leaders who responded to 9/11 by leaning on Cold War reasoning.\n\nI believe the same is happening now with political and financial leaders in regard to 2008. \u201cBecause there is no systemic risk,\u201d the 2008 line of reasoning goes, \u201cthe fallout will be contained.\u201d\n\nBut when more than three million people lose their jobs in a single week, you don\u2019t need systemic risk to see unmitigated fallout. This may not be a financial crisis, but it is certainly an economic crisis.\n\n**3. Just because systemic failure is not occurring within the financial system, does not mean it is not happening.**\n\nJust look at the healthcare system.\n\nIn 2008, banks were undercapitalized. This was really the root of the systemic failure that occurred. This time, it is hospitals that are overcapacity.\n\nThe overwhelming number of severe cases of coronavirus is overwhelming hospital resources around the world. Ventilators, personal protective equipment, and healthcare workers themselves are suddenly in very short supply. This affects not only COVID-19 patients, but also *all* those who need medical attention for any reason. Pregnant women, gunshot victims, kids with broken wrists, older folks with a bad case of the run-of-the-mill flu all get affected. There\u2019s your systemic failure.\n\nI generally subscribe to the old adage that the most dangerous words in investing are \u201cthis time is different,\u201d but this time really is different from the last crisis we saw. It is so different, in fact, that we cannot take refuge that it does not look like 2008. That reality should not be used as a salve or a comfort, but should rather be taken as a warning to us. If it did look like 2008, at a minimum we would be dealing with a known. Instead, we are confronting the unknown and all of the unknown unknowns that go along with that.\n\n [https://www.coindesk.com/dont-apply-2008-thinking-to-todays-crisis?fbclid=IwAR2UYFJQX5UsKpMMZZnuWH\\_DQOb6XKrlGiRHybBKJ7VHOkHErl\\_YvPUgJMA](https://www.coindesk.com/dont-apply-2008-thinking-to-todays-crisis?fbclid=IwAR2UYFJQX5UsKpMMZZnuWH_DQOb6XKrlGiRHybBKJ7VHOkHErl_YvPUgJMA)",

As soon as they start **broad testing, get CASH GANG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Introduction\n\nLet me explain.\n\nSomething that has not been discussed a lot from what I hear on discord/read in the sub: **antibody** testing. Yeah I get, shit is bad and world will collapse and so on but hear me out - the permabulls will take any major positive news for a good 10% rally. \n\nAntibody testing is already done in New York and testing capacities are about to be expanded:\n\n[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1)\n\nAdditionally the head of the Charit\u00e8  - most reputable medical institution in Germany - announced that there will be anti-body testing of big groups in **around 2 weeks.**\n\nSource (GERMAN - ENG sub):  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GNhq1LHhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GNhq1LHhQ)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Conclusion\n\nWhile we are riding into an economic armageddon, we still wanna ride the waves up and down. After we will get a big downie from SPY being rejected at 263, we will still see a **massive rally** at the time when **antibody tests are shown to be effective in just a single country** because it will most likely be the same data for all the other countries. I can only give a timeframe, which would be somewhere between  **4/14-21**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Side-takeaway:\n\nEveryone who is doing \"diamond\" hands - if you don\u00b4t have leaps, you should probably switch to trading with the trend/go more Cash because while we will get a lot of bad news - there will also be very promising good news soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust my 2 cents, go ahead and flame or whatever you wanna do.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 20th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOzzG6Qk28))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.22.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=744D8neX74s))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

This also expecting that the gov\u2019t will introduce never before seen amounts of stimulus and QE within the next 2 months.\n\n1. US has been FKn around too long with no tests and no cancelling of large events/quarantine. The horse has left the stable on this one.\n\n2. Italy this morning just announced they have 22k cases of Corona. Italy has a population of 60 million. China has a population of 1.4 billion and only declared 80k cases of Corona. China most likely had millions of infected during peak, and the general public does not see this.\n\n3. Countries haven\u2019t been going into panic until they\u2019ve reached about 10k cases. US is only at 2.5k and is growing exponentially at 25% per day (this is with limited testing).\n\n4. I don\u2019t expect the virus to take down the market, sell-offs will be panic-based in the beginning. I don\u2019t see the market to do a V-shaped rebound because of supply chains and reduced labour market in the US. Companies are going to take a hit and will require financial assistance to get back on their feet.\n\n5.

Keep watching futures and news to confirm. Look for short/put entries EOW or early in the next week if bull trap is confirmed.

At travel agencies in Atlanta and Los Angeles, several workers lost their jobs as bookings evaporated. Christie Lites, a stage-lighting company in Orlando, laid off more than 100 of its 500 workers nationwide this past week and likely will lay off 150 more, according to chief executive Huntly Christie. Meanwhile a hotel in Seattle is closing an entire department, a former employee said, and as many as 50 people lost their jobs after the South by Southwest festival in Austin got canceled.\n\n&gt;\tEconomists fear more layoffs in the coming weeks as supply chains come to a halt and people stay home and spend less.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cWe will definitely see an effect on jobs from the coronavirus, and it could be pretty large in leisure and hospitality,\u201d said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter. \u201cThe first thing we\u2019ll see is a reduction in hours. We hear many reports of employers canceling staff everywhere except in health care.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tMonday in Los Angeles, Sam Creighton and about 20 colleagues were fired from the China Visa Service Center. Creighton helped Americans get travel documents to China, but business plummeted as groups and individuals canceled trips to Asia out of virus fear. The company processed around 400 visas a month; in February, that number fell to 22. The visa center did not return a request for comment.\n\n&gt;\t\"This job was my paycheck,\u201d said Creighton, 27, who worked at the company for about three years. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do next.\"",

        "selftext": " After watching the DD post about the repo market, I\u2019ve decided to also contribute to WSB intellectual department of Finances instead of making picture memes.\n\nI hope this would cover about the problems the financial market is facing, the possibility of a Lehman Brothers round two electric boomgaloo, the DD post consists of Four parts \u2013\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntro of the Eurodollar\n\nAn introduction about the repo liquidity crisis in Sep 2019 \u2013 Dec 2019 \n\nHow did the beer virus changed everything and the possibility of having another financial system collapse\n\nIs Deutsche bank the new Lehman Brothers?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease tell me if there are any problems with my DD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntro of the Eurodollar: \n\nFirstly, the USD is the global currency that everyone uses for most economic transactions, but most of the transactions outside of the US was done in the form of Eurodollars. In the 1960s, there was a full-fledged Eurodollar market operating entirely outside of the US banking system and therefore without US regulation.\n\nSo, what are Eurodollars? According to Milton Friedman, Eurodollar system creates new US dollar money supply out of thin air at the stroke of a bookkeeper\u2019s pen with no backing by gold or by physical cash issued by the US Treasury. Because all of this was happening outside of the US banking system, it was exempt from regulation that would have otherwise prevented it from occurring inside the US banking system. \n\nThe leverage ratio was mostly made on a 1:9 basis (100000 USD creates an additional 900000 USD to banks outside of the US) but not a single dollar was moved and remains as a interbank liability, which should means that the money still remains in the bank of the US, but banks outside of the US still has 9 times leverage thanks to US banks giving it US liquidity. \n\nAccording to Jeffrey Snider first PowerPoint (link of his podcasts and the PowerPoint could be found at the Res section) The origins of the US dollar shortage during the crisis are linked to the expansion since 2000 in banks\u2019 international balance sheets. The outstanding stock of banks\u2019 foreign claims grew from $10 trillion at the beginning of 2000 to $34 trillion by end-2007, a significant expansion even when scaled by global economic activity. The year-on-year growth in foreign claims approached 30% by mid-2007, up from around 10% in 2001.\n\nSo, the world was short on dollars due to over expansion and over lending which led to a shortage of USD/ a liquidity squeeze and the market collapsed fearing the lack of USD at least according to Jeffrey Snider.\n\nThe feds than step in and starts to print juicy USD to satisfy the masses known as QE.  The world was back to track and continues to lend out those Eurodollars like normal to outside of the US, until 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRepo liquidity crisis in late 2019:\n\nWhile the feds have been pumping 100 Bn repo loans to banks in Mar 5 due to high liquidity shortage: \n\nNew York Fed had pumped $100 billion in 1-day repo loans into the trading houses on Wall Street, $8.6 billion short of what the trading houses had sought to borrow. Even at the peak of the repo loan crisis that began on September 17, 2019 and through the end of January 2020, the Fed had never pumped out $100 billion in 1-day repo loans on a single day. Yesterday, the Fed pumped out another $100 billion in 1-day repo loans against demand for $111 billion \u2013 further evidence that Wall Street firms are in need of liquidity.\n\nThe fed has been pumping smaller amounts of repo loans beginning during a crisis between Sep \u2013 Dec 2019, nobody knows what trigger it, but it just happens suddenly:\n\nIn the week of Sept. 16, a lot of cash flowed out of the repo pipes just as more securities were flowing in -- meaning that suddenly there wasn\u2019t enough cash for those who needed it. That mismatch drove overnight repo rates to 10% on Sept. 17, from about 2% the week before. And the feds begins to step in and provide liquidity to the masses again by the Not QE operation. \n\nSeptember 27: at least $75 billion in overnight repos, and at least $30 billion in 14-day repos\n\nSeptember 30 to October 10: at least $75 billion in overnight repos\n\nIn total more than $320 billion of total repo market support from the Fed since Sept. 17, when for the central bank began pumping in daily liquidity after overnight lending rates jumped to almost 10% from nearly 2%.\n\nPic of the total repo operation Sep-Dec 2019: [https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2019/12/03/Photos/NS/MW-HW284\\_Bianco\\_20191203143402\\_NS.jpg?uuid=dc0fca12-1603-11ea-90a4-9c8e992d421e](https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2019/12/03/Photos/NS/MW-HW284_Bianco_20191203143402_NS.jpg?uuid=dc0fca12-1603-11ea-90a4-9c8e992d421e)\n\nJPMorgan even secretly swapping dollars out for U.S. Treasury instruments, estimates could be high as $250 billion worth.\n\nBut nevertheless, a crisis that people outside of the financial circle never know about was safely avoided and while there could be a crisis in the future, 2019 is safe for now, the crisis may come one day but not that fast\u2026. Until the beer virus suddenly rams through the door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beer virus:\n\nIn an interconnected world where money, cargo and people travel across continents more frequent than ever. The beer virus has suddenly created the First Global Supply-Chain Crisis and causes an unprecedent demand and supply shock that no one knows what would happen. \n\nPicture of the economic impact of the beer virus to countries: https://promarket.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CORONAVIRUS2.jpg\n\nThe fed suddenly went into panic mode, the 2008 crisis was caused by many debts (including debts from real estate) and not being repaid, imagine what would happen on a global scale when everything suddenly comes to a halt? \n\nA 50-rate cut comes but the market still drops down, the banks are in extreme panic and there are massive bonds buying everyday but the buying was already started since Dec 2019. This shows that there might be some problems the big banks/feds may know about, but they seems to be hiding about it. \n\nRemember the Eurodollar that was being used by everyone and was leveraged around 9x ratio? Even if there is a small liquidity squeeze, a chain reaction would occur and bring the global financial system down. So, I would not surprise a 75 point rate comes, but the virus is causing a supply chain problem and it seems that the point cut is unlikely to save the market unless the Fed starts to QE again since the repo market is already facing liquidity problems again, with 116 Bn shortage on Mar 5 and the Fed is just pumping 100 Bn. \n\nSo keep an eye on the repo market, the more shortage is has the more possibly the banks would need to sell its assets for cash causing a further market decline (see Short intro about the repo market)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDeutsche bank the new Lehman Brothers?\n\nWhen most banks stock prices climbs up above or at least remains at around 2008 levels, Deutsche bank stock price in 2008 is 24.39 and now is just 7.59 with a market cap of only 15.86 Bn. Considering banks like BOA has a market cap around 220 Bn, the fourth largest bank in Europe has the bank had total assets of 1.541 trillion dollars and total liabilities of 1.469 trillion dollars but with just a pathetic net income of 341 Mil in 2018 and only 15.86 Bn market capital should show you that there is high probability of it to go bust. \n\nBut the problem is Deutsche bank could be the new Lehman Brothers because it has 49 trillion dollars in exposure to derivatives, it puts Deutsche Bank in the same league as the bank holding companies of U.S. juggernauts JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, which logged in at $48 trillion, $47 trillion and $42 trillion, respectively, at the end of December 2018 according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Furthermore, Deutsche Bank is heavily interconnected financially to JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America as well as other mega banks in Europe.\n\nThe negative interest rate have made banks in Europe unable to generate profits and some debt defaults like 2-4% rate would already send the bank to bankruptcy combine with a potential USD shortage and the beer virus spreading in Europe causing havoc, Deutsche bank could become the new Lehman brothers and with its high exposures to derivatives should ring some warning sounds to all of us.\n\nA graph of its connection with other banks: [https://wallstreetonparade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Systemic-Risk-Among-Deutsche-Bank-and-Global-Systemically-Important-Banks.jpg](https://wallstreetonparade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Systemic-Risk-Among-Deutsche-Bank-and-Global-Systemically-Important-Banks.jpg)\n\nConclusion:\n\nI would highly recommend to pay attention to recent news since there are so many factors that any of it could easily make the whole modern financial system collapse and also remember that we are also facing a supply chain event that there is no historical precedent.

        "selftext": "While writing this, SPY's ten year trend line has been broken. This leaves 250 as the next point of resistance. If 250 is broken, [u/Variation-Separate](https://www.reddit.com/user/Variation-Separate/) could be spot on with his 269 rally prediction.\n\nI expect Friday's unemployment numbers to affect the current trend ([https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news\\_release/laus.htm](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/laus.htm)). Everyone expects the numbers to be bad, so it's a matter of how bad. If the numbers are not too bad it could actually help this rally, however if they're awful it may halt or reverse the rally. Right now estimates sit between 1 million and 2.5 million unemployed.\n\nI am starting to feel COVID is getting closer to being priced in. I am starting to doubt we see SPY reach $200/share. The sectors that will be hit the hardest have already taken -50+% losses and the companies that can survive the pandemic are beginning to level off or rise.\n\nI was too young to experience the 2008 housing crisis however I do not look at this as a similar situation. Based off of what I've heard, people were in denial of the housing bubble fucking the economy in 2008. Today, people are aware of the problems facing the economy and many of the companies that will be affected most by COVID have already taken heavy losses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt looks like Visa, MasterCard, AAPL, and real estate is keeping the S&amp;P in the green. Airlines are also doing pretty great. Communication services, IT, health care, and AMZN are struggling.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Q6ppJiA](https://imgur.com/a/Q6ppJiA) (Screenshot taken at 11:42 EST)\n\n \\- Visa seems to be following Mastercard similar to how Lyft is following Uber. Yesterday MA issued a second COVID-19 revenue warning causing a red day while the S&amp;P500 finished green. Today marks a record breaking green day for the two so plenty of investors feel comfortable jumping aboard despite the COVID-19 revenue warnings. I don't expect V and MA to prop up the S&amp;P any further tomorrow. Green will have to come from elsewhere if the rally is to continue to 270, however I don't expect V or MA to hold the S&amp;P back from the rally.\n\n \\- Deutsche bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes now is the time to buy AAPL with a price target of $270 (from $290). He sees risks such as store closures and supply chain delays as short term problems. Ong is relying on the incoming 5G IPhone cycle to drive strong growth. I highly doubt AAPL will be holding back the S&amp;P from rallying. Investors plan on staying for the long term.\n\n \\- Real Estate seems to be green primarily due to the promise of an economic relief package passing. This green is heavily reliant on the relief package passing in the senate. The same is true for airlines. I expect the bill to pass today. Sen. Dick Derbin (Minority whip) is very excited about the bill. Watch the live stream here: [https://www.c-span.org/video/?470652-1/senate-expected-vote-coronavirus-economic-relief-bill&amp;live](https://www.c-span.org/video/?470652-1/senate-expected-vote-coronavirus-economic-relief-bill&amp;live)\n\n \\- Communication Services (Google and Facebook) are strong. I am confident Google will not be impacted very heavily by COVID-19. Today's red day is temporary. They make money from providing advertisements and can artificially modify their supply by showing less or more advertisements to fit any demand. They are clearly confident in their ability to weather this storm because they just extended contracts for contracted employees by 90 days. They also have funds to help part time workers. FB will be weaker than Google but I expect them to also be fine.\n\n \\- Amazon stopped taking orders in India for the next 21 days due to the country wide lock down. They are also only accepting essential items at their warehouses in the US. With the expected spike in unemployed, I see a decline in online shopping despite more people staying at home.  I expect this to continue weighing down the stock while COVID spreads.\n\n \\- Consumer Staples (Walmart, PG, etc) are fairly neutral today however I expect COVID to continue weighing negatively on these companies. I doubt they rise anytime soon. They may continue falling. I'm not sure if it will be enough to bring down the entire index.\n\n \\- I'm not very familiar with our health care system so cannot at this time provide much DD on this sector. I also haven't mentioned anything about the Financials, Industrials, Utilities, Energy, or Materials sectors of the S&amp;P500 because I don't know shit about them. I'm still learning...\n\n \\- Oil prices are beginning to rise. Check u/Variation-Seperate's excellent DD on how this could affect SPY.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:** 3/27/20 UUP 29.00/29.50 CALLS BABY\n\n**EDIT AND TLDR** : UUP is a way to measure US dollar futures vs shorts on our trade partners. It goes up when we do better than they do. Bad things are happening in Europe and less bad things happening here. UUP goes up a little and since it has a low IV it\u2019s not super expensive.\n\n\nSince a lot of people have been YOLO'ing poor investments in the past few days because of the premium price hikes, I decided to find something that wasn't SPY puts with low entry cost for all the noobs and guys out there 50k into a margin call, working their way up.\n\nHere comes UUP.\n\n**What's UUP?**\n\nUUP is the Invesco Deutche Bank US Dollar Bullish Index Fund. Essentially what it does is \"provide inverse exposure to an index of USDX futures contracts that rises in value as the dollar appreciates relative to a basket of world currencies (i.e. US trading partners)\". USDX is the index that measures the value of the US Dollar relative to our trading partners currency- of which, 57.6% is Euro, 13.6% is Yen, 11.9% is the UK Pound, 9.1% is the Canadian Dollar, 4.2% is the Swedish krona, and 3.6% is the Swiss franc.\n\nBasically, UUP goes up when our currency increases in value relative to shorts on trading partners currency.\n\n**Why will UUP go up?**\n\nSince we're trying to measure rate of change between USD and our trading partners, lets discuss the two parties.\n\nFirst, the USD has a general sense of stability behind it. While the market has been getting absolutely thrashed as of late, Boomers (who control a plurality of total American assets) still have faith in the underlying economy (trust me, Bloomberg told me so yesterday). Everyone and their mother is planning on a 'V shaped recovery.' Even if the Fed prints money until they run out of the color green, give everyone 10k, bail out airlines, cruises, hotels, dog parks, and wherever you go for WSB loss therapy sessions, the dollar devaluation spike will take at LEAST a few weeks to set in.\n\nNow, Europe is in a completely different circumstance. They're not feeling nearly as good on their currency as of late, largely because of how much more significantly they've been effected by massive corporate debt, along with growing fears of COVID affecting individual countries. Germany is the largest single contributor to the Euro stability, and they only just raised their alert level to 'High' yesterday (3/17). on the same day when Italy declared nearly 500 deaths due to Beervirus, their neighbor (the Germans) are taking it fairly lightly. The Robert Koch Institute, a German research institute established by the German federal government, warned that their will be 10M cases of COVID-19 in Germany in the next three months, and it will only get worse if they don't take it more seriously. Additionally, the rest of Europe does not have the same style health system that America has. While yes, the American Health system has its flaws, it is rather good at processing people, which could help prevent massive swells of patients in hospitals that the European health systems don't have.\n\nNow that this new stimulus is going to happen and futures are green, tomorrow and maybe even Friday will see 3% growth in UUP, and I project it will break its 52 week high again just 2 days after hitting 28.01.\n\nSo long as the US dollar doesn't absolutely crap itself, pretty much USDX just has to wait for the Euro to sink.\n\n**Why invest in UUP?**\n\nThe implied volatility of a $28.00 UUP call is 25%. Depending on which SPY put you invested in you might be looking at an IV of 150% or more, so premiums have adjusted accordingly, and while yeah you're still printing cash investing in SPY puts, you're not going to be printing 500% returns anymore. $29.50 3/27 calls are trading at like 0.25, so their dirt cheap, and you'll be soaking in 43.5% gaines if UUP hits 28.00 literally tomorrow, which it very likely will hit because every day USDX opens about a dollar above the previous day's close, and UUP closed at 27.90 today (opened at 27.03).\n\nStonks may go down but portfolios only go up, right boys?",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interview with Cramer** \n\nIt happened on Friday evening, here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAqPQKBXkWc).\n\n**Summary** \\- taken from the video and a bit of other sources (their website..etc)\n\nThere are many corona virus stocks out there but I think this one stands out. \n\n1. The CEO revealed that they are working with the US government. At the moment only large cap companies like MMM are known to be doing so. Being a small cap company the revenue from PPE (personal protective equipment) is going to increase OMI's value substantially.\n2. The market showed interest immediately after the Cramer show. Stock price went up 23.6% in AH immediately after interview.\n3. This company has distribution centers in the US and Europe for exporting medical supplies. \n4. Manufacturing done in America! No supply chain issues. Other competitors who manufacture in China saw their production shut down due to the Lunar New Year and beyond due to the virus. \n\n**The Company**\n\nOwens and Minor ($OMI) is a global manufacturing and distributing medical supply company with offices in the US and Europe. They make masks and gloves and other crap that helps in the beer flu crisis. Their CEO, Ed Pesicka, originally an executive from Thermal Fisher (TMO), joined Owens and Minor about a year ago. He's been fixing the customer service which bled the company for years. He's been restructuring the company for the past 9-10 months back to industry standard. It beat EPS in the last 3 quarters. Ed Pesicka is getting results.\n\n**Meeting Demand**\n\nEd sees mask demand in NYC raise from 20k to 200k-300k per week in just one hospital. The company is ramped up production to meet demands in medical protective gear. From January to end of February there was an increase of 50 million masks per month. They are **working closely with the FEMA, the white house team, and HHS**.\n\nThere will be a substantial increase in demand. CDC guidance on masks expected to [change](https://twitter.com/DrMattMcCarthy/status/1243891663162019841) in next 10 days. Americans will be advised to wear masks in everyday life. Current recommendation is for high-risk groups only.\n\n**Exporting**\n\nThey seem to be in a position to sell masks to Europe as well as they have distribution centers there. Trump keeps saying we can sell ventilators to Europe. Why not sell other flu gear as well?\n\n60+ of their distribution centers are located in the US, with 11 in [Europe](https://www.owens-minor.com/our-solutions/distribution-and-warehousing/). Logistics already in place for exporting.\n\n**Comparing with other corona virus stocks**\n\nThe advantage of OMI over other similar stocks like APT is that we know they're working with the US government. Like MMM, but with a much smaller market cap. The revenue from the increased demand will make this stock undervalued. \n\n**Possible Future Catalysts**\n\n1.  Change in CDC guidance. Americans wearing masks everyday.\n2. Name called by Mike Pence just like MMM! There will be a much more significant effect due to the market cap size.\n3. Earnings in two months. Expect it to beat EPS by a large margin due to the January to February ramp up with a very good guidance.\n\n**Magical Technical**\n\n1. This stock has not gone parabolic like the others like APT, CODX have. Still cheap!\n2. Blew away several resistance levels in AH after interview with Cramer - $6, $6.5, $7. Bounced off at $7.8\n3. Break out above resistance at $7.8, HUGE gap up to about $17. Now at 6.81.\n4. Comparing how much other small cap virus stocks have performed, this will jump to $15-$20 and falls back to about $10 (like the others). The size of the gap also suggests a jump of that size. \n\nTL:DR - $10 calls.",

Years from now you will tell future generations about the _disgusting_ things you had to do to get your 300th extra roll of toilet paper. \n\n So what are we doing:\n\n- Closing schools (remember how many times they didn't close your school when you were a kid and now they close it for at least a month!  Kids these days have it so easy!).  Yep.\n\n- Restricting travel to other countries.  Yep.\n\n- Closing restaurants and bars (drinking away the pain at home just doesn't express my misery enough, I need to be in some piece of shit bar drinking grain alcohol).  Yep.\n\n- America alone spending at least a trillion to address it.  Yeppers.\n\n- Giving everyone equal access to test since it's a \"humanitarian crisis\".  Wait... \n\nThe testing facility won't even test me unless I see a doctor and prove that I don't have the flu or strep throat first.  That means I have to go to see a doctor before I can go to the testing facility you're asking me to go to during work hours since I can't go to work because the virus is so serious, I can't even work).  And yet ALL of the Lakers and Nets have been tested and they didn't even have to get out of their car once to do it.\n\nIt's almost as if, [cash rules everything around me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBwAxmrE194). \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBecause it does.  And there's a lot less money being spent in a world where I sit on the my couch holding onto my cash to make sure I make my mortgage payment.  They'd much rather I give some money to my weed guy, spend a ton more money buying snacks and then my weed guy buys Jordan's with the money I paid him.  Win-Win-Win.\n\nGiving the Lakers and Nets special access to testing shows the common denominator in life is STILL money.    Come the end of the month people will prioritize money again, everyone will go back to work, and the economy will make money again.  \n\nWhy 3/31?  Because changing the calendar changes your mentality when it comes to big events.  You'll suddenly feel different in April.  The virus will be so-February by then.

Apologies, but I'm too lazy to site shit.\n\n**I. The Death of Risk Parity Signals Inflation** \n\nSo the risk-party is trade has disappeared now that stocks and bonds are moving together. But wait, what the fuck does it even mean for the negative correlation to flip? I hypothesize this signals inflation.\n\nWhy? Well, let me teach you some history. The relationship between stocks and bonds has not always been this way. Here's the chart of bond yields vs stock going back to when the boomers were fucked into existence:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/irpl351nv9o41.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=968aba76ed6cf362d58d76a13235f0a93efb5716\n\nNotice, the current relationship between stocks and bonds harkens back to the 1980s right after a huge inflationary moment. Pre 1980s, policy was focused on reining in inflation. Since then, particularly since the market crashes of the 2000s, the mindset shifted from an inflationary one to a deflationary one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erucs24rw9o41.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2427382fba830c32ce7076d22e392dcc8109b0c9\n\nIn a deflationary mindset, when stock prices go down, an asset manager worries about deflation, so he'll run to bonds. When stock prices go up, deflation is no longer feared, so the manager gets out of bonds. This is what we've been experiencing since the 80s.\n\nTransitioning to an inflationary environment, however, both asset classes track one another more closely. This will not happen overnight, likely over a few years, but we may be seeing the beginnings of a transition at this moment.\n\n**II. The Post Virus Era**\n\nI do not think we will have a v-shaped recovery. The post-virus world will differ wildly from what we knew. I imagine the differences may be somewhat akin to what we experienced post 9/11. Trump and his staff calling COVID the \"Chinese virus\" is a glimpse of the future. Going forward, expect\n\n* Trade restrictions\n* Travel restrictions\n* De-globalization\n* De-risking across industries\n* Increased costs throughout supply chains\n* Lower P/E multiples\n* Inflation\n\nBusiness will not be conducted as usual.\n\nWhile, yes, industries are on the brink of collapse, it's still somewhat bizarre that we still have such little buying. Given all the QE and promise of stimulus, surely some of the current prices make sense even if you account for three more months of lost revenue. Many companies are trading below their book values. Insiders are buying. What gives? I believe the market is aware that the future will look quite different.\n\n**III.  Why QE is doing Jack Shit**\n\nI believe one of the reason's price has not stabilized at all despite the assurances of free money is that the market does not believe the old prices will be realized: fair value will be far lower. This is not just in equity valuations though. This discrepancy has appeared in all of the corporate bond ETFs where the ETFs are trading at a 5% discount, and market makers don't seem interested in making markets at the current levels: they're still afraid they'll lose. Even though the fed has put up a trillion dollars (theoretically they could put up an infinite amount),  no one wants in--even with free money!--because the market hasn't believed we're at the bottom. The would never happen if we were anywhere near fair value. This is also why I believe we are currently so oversold and yet still have a bit more room to sell.\n\n**IV.  Hunting for Fair Value**\n\nInsider buying is worthwhile watching right now. There are some companies trading at absurdly low price to book valuations, and the executive know it. I'd recommend avoiding puts on any names with a lot of insider buying. You will get fucked out of the water, especially as these guys tell friends and family to buy. I got my ass handed to me on an SPG play because those fuckers started buying stock by the fist-full even through there P/E was still fairly high. Similarly, avoid puts on stocks that are trading below book value unless you're damn certain they're headed for bankruptcy.\n\nI would not buy puts next week unless you're completely autistic.\n\n\\---\n\nPositions:\n\n4/17p F, GM, GE, USO, INDA, EWW, EWZ, EEM, LUV, M\n\nYes, some of these are illiquid.

        "selftext": "Repost of an old post I found on reddit, never more relevant than right now.\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-should-I-do-during-a-stock-market-crash/answer/Jay-Hauer\n\nCredit to Jay Hauer on making this post. I do not know if he is correct or not (hence would like an active discussion from the community) but I wanted to put out the major points he put out there.\n\n&gt;First of all, it\u2019s important to understand that the vast majority of the time, crashes come in the context of bear markets. The 1987 crash is one rare exception and occurred during a bull market (note I\u2019m not counting \u201cmini-crashes\u201d here, such as 2010, but only true large-scale crashes).\n\n&gt;Once you understand that crashes virtually always come during bear markets, the next thing you need to understand is that there are two types of bear markets:\n\n&gt;Cyclical bear markets: These are relatively short-lived bear markets that occur in the context of a much larger bull market. Examples of cyclical bear markets are basically every bear we\u2019ve seen since 1982, including the tech crash of 2000, and the 2008 crash during the financial crisis. Cyclical bear markets end on V-bottoms and launch right back into bull markets (most recent example: the 2009 low).\n\n&gt;Secular bear markets: Secular bear markets are sometimes called \u201cgenerational bear markets.\u201d Secular bear markets can last for many years; even decades. Examples include: 1906\u20131921; 1937\u20131949; and the most recent being 1968\u20131982. **Secular bear markets do not end with V-bottoms, they die on total indifference. By the time a secular bear has run its course, NOBODY wants to own stocks anymore. Stocks are universally perceived to be a horrible investment, so nobody cares when a secular bear ends, and most people don\u2019t even notice.**\n\n&gt;Those of you who own digital watches will immediate realize one important fact: **No one who started trading/investing after 1982 has ever seen a secular bear market.**\n\n&gt;This is why you\u2019re getting advice on this question such as \u201cDon\u2019t sell in a crash!\u201d \u201cBe sure to buy the whole way down!\u201d \u201cStocks always come back for the long haul!\u201d This advice is spoken by people who have only lived through cyclical bears, in the context of the much larger secular bull market that began in 1982. And it\u2019s really, really dangerous advice.\n\n&gt;Imagine if you took this advice in 1968, and started buying as the market began tanking. **If you \u201cbought the whole way down,\u201d you would be underwater until the 1990\u2019s.** I don\u2019t know what sort of time horizon you have, but most people aren\u2019t prepared to sit on losses for 20+ years. You could be dead by the time you break even.",

        "selftext": "Tl;dr: Behavioral consumer changes after the virus are not priced in. Long dated puts on anything non-essential: \n$LYV, $EXPE, $CCL, $MGM, $SBUX\n\nThe autist bulls are trying to spin a new story: *\u201cYeah, the economy is basically shut down for 1, 2 or 3 months but then everything comes back roaring into action*\u201d Just watch CNBC for an hour to know what I'm talking about. They are right that we're not going to go Mad max. But even in the best case scenario, consumer behavior will be severely affected.\n\nHowever, once lockdowns around the world are starting to be lifted, don't expect people to walk into e.g. Starbucks like they used to before. **This is not priced in.**\n\nWhy is this? \n\n1) Well, a lot people are still gonna try to avoid large crowds because they haven't been infected (yet). Doctors and institutions don't say everyone will get infected. This will play a significant role until a vaccine is developed. \n\n2) A lot of people have just been laid off (and people still with a job saw how easy it was for others to get laid off). ~75% or so might go straight back to their original job, but with the knowledge that their employer will let them go if they have to shut down for a few weeks. Of course this can be a good thing as people can get benefits. However, this will result in a major risk-averse consumer trend that is hard to break. Were some people thinking of buying a new 47-inch TV before the lockdowns started? After the lockdown, people rather keep money at hand, as people perceive their jobs, the economy and the world as more fragile than they could ever imagine. Hence, people will save up for future bad times and avoid frivolous purchases. \n\nOf course, there will be a slight peak after lockdowns. People will spend their $1000 on stupid shit once they are able to. But this will not hold.",

I barely know what i am talking about and i have posted absolutely no reference material but this is what i think is going on.** \n\nThe people who dont read into the epidemiology of Covid-19 are the real butt heads. \n\nComparing the flu to it is like comparing a pinto to a ferrari.\n\nMy heart goes out to china, they are getting effed by their government, its gut wrenching. cant even watch the leaked footage. Like the impotent pence, all i can do is pray for them. Also notice how the US isntt really reporting the effed up shit thats happening out there? Remember the NBA? Maybe China has us by the balls because they make our anti-biotics? I imagine it would take at least a year to bootstrap our own production. \n\nThe united states was greedy enough and dumb enough to give production of goods to an authoritarian government, hence they have quite a bit of leverage over us during dire times like this. as was seen when they silenced our most vocal social justice celebrities.\n\nIve asked everyone i know what they think about the virus and pretty much everybody is ignorant. They dont know how fast covid-19 spreads and how its mortality rate spreads out based on age. Some believe its just another thing that will go away like all the other ones. \n\n**Virus Spread Rate:**\n\nIn south Korea cases are doubling every 2.4 days. Pretty sure the CDC or WHO or whoever is trying to get people to not panic includes chinas bull shit numbers in their analysis. No further research was done into this, i have a full time job (probably not for long) and with that its hard to dig into everything. I rely heavily on small podcast that prove themselves to be rational, logical, and experts in their field, eye witnesses to both the market front and the virus front.  Podcasts are in link below. \n\n**Links:**\n\n*Macro Voices* \\- [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICRehoZjq3ZtAWgRJX118A/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICRehoZjq3ZtAWgRJX118A/videos)\n\n*Peak Prosperity* \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVQC1hAYZBs&amp;t=950s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVQC1hAYZBs&amp;t=950s)\n\n**Mortality Rate:**\n\nYouth - low numbers (look it up)\n\nBoomers - 5-14% mortality rate depending on age (look it up)\n\n**Complications Percentage (Requires Hospital):**\n\n20%\n\n**My Shitty understanding of how fast the virus can spread - doubling every 2.4 days.** \n\nIf government does absolutely nothing or our behavior does not change we will have 3 million confirmed cases within 3 months. At 3 million cases we would need 600k hospital beds. US has 100,000 hospital beds total. Think 1929 run on the bank but run on the hospital that spurs pur mania. Again thats if the government does nothing and quarantines and tests are not started immediately. The US not testing people is making us more and more susceptible to a giant shit storm. \n\n**Again i can easily be wrong, im not a dr. or a specialist in anything in any way, just saying what i think and what i have heard.**",

You need to know there is a HUGE difference between business success and stock success. The valuation of a company has WAY LESS to do with business success than you think. You are right, things will be GREAT for them soon, but not now. \n\nValuations before the virus were at an all time high, companies were using loans that cost a little to make a little more (AT RECORD LEVELS). In fact it\u2019s gotten so bad recently that companies are HAVING to take out riskier and riskier loans just to keep up with the market.\n\nSoooo what does this mean to your brilliant business ventures... \n\nThe same virus that gave the company that opportunity.... Will be the reason it goes down. The general amount of money going into and out of the market is REMARKABLY more important than how good your company does.\n\nPLEASE get out in front and either go cash gang or play options. PLEASE stop posting asking about which stock will be the largest quarantine beneficiary. You can find those yourselves, all of those charts will already be pointing up. ITS NOT TOP SECRET WHICH ARE GREEN WHEN EVERYTHING IS RED. They are all in the same bucket. \n\nI made this post in an attempt to reduce the amount of those posts I would be scrolling through by 1-5% and hopefully my right thumb-joint focused carpal tunnel I\u2019ll obviously be attributing to you all instead of my weird pornhub fetishes I just can\u2019t quite figure out at 4am. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m done, guess what time it is ;)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nUPDATE***\n\n*Account balance +300% since last post*\n\n\nNow that we are in the full heat of this I thought I would post an update. After today\u2019s after hours movement, it\u2019s safe to say full on recession is inevitable. So AGAIN please do not chase obvious plays that are already down 60%. \n\nYour airline/casino/cruise plays are running out of meat on the bone as far as shorting stuff goes. The best question always is... What\u2019s next?\n\nSo typically as risk tolerance shrinks we see a broad decline. These boomers are finally scared and they will be dropping ETF\u2019s and other huge buckets of stocks soon. SO WE HAVE TO HIT WHATS STILL PROPPED UP.\n\nTECH BANKS REAL ESTATE HOMEBUILDERS, this is where the juice remains. Find anything with a lot of debt, a high PE ratio, low cashflows or any other warning sign and hammer those puts for April or June. This thing is unwinding fast and once we shake the tree a lot of weak branches are going to fall out. \n\nPersonally I\u2019ve moved out of my airline/Casino puts and flipped over to stuff like DOCU and AMD. There may be some hotels with meat left and some lesser thought of restaurants like Texas Roadhouse will be hammered as well.\n\nStay ahead of the curve. Bulls and Bears make money, trend following does not\n\n================================",

        "selftext": " Before getting to analysis &amp; projections, I first need to lay out new findings. There's been posts / articles floating around detailing specific bills put in place following the great recession in 2008; articles which claim, following this great financial crisis in 2008 our gov't had taken steps which effectively merged both the federal reserve and treasury into one entity, which \\*allegedly\\* is under the supervision of the executive branch (more specifically, the president / whatever his or her team sees best fit for the current situation.) Moreover, the federal reserve is able to exchange securities within the stock market in order to recoup these 'debts' in a similar way that it would with bonds or other collateralize securities traditionally. {See details regarding the federal reserve &amp; trading equities to recoup debts as detailed in 2005 [here](https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2005/november/monetary-policy-stocks-sale-purchase/).}\n\nOne last thing I must lay forth before going into analysis; the previous link is the best I can find which might 'validate' the updated bills, and an update was added to the base of that web-page following the 2008 crisis which states, \" On November 25, 2008, in the height of the financial crisis the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin purchasing up to $100 billion in agency debt and up to $500 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities. Since that time it has announced several other large-scale asset purchase programs.\" Following that line of text with a link which claimed to be 'access to their balance sheets' or 'the evolution of the FED's security holdings... and that link has since been deactivated. (WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LINK THAT WAS POSTED ON A LEGITIMATE ORGANIZATIONAL WEBSITE) So yes, I am accepting the information presented on these bills/laws as true; and before continuing to read this post you will need to 'accept the above terms and conditions' lmao (Seriously tho, feel free to further contest them or try and validate the claims as you please, I have done a fair bit of research but haven't found anything concrete that contests the claims laid before us in the circulating articles.)\n\nSo what do these provisions mean? By accepting the above claims, it would basically mean that our gov't has the power to be actively playing 'the big short' in the stock exchange, targeting various failing sectors (taking the positions from large scale investing firms or openly in the market). More specifically sectors which have been lagging behind economically / they do not see fit to push our economic growth in the LT future... (The ability to pump up a market &amp; make it look appealing enough for common investors to act amidst a slew of market uncertainty/upcoming catalysts) Mind you this is ALSO while having open access to infinite market manipulation at virtually no cost , and realistically are yielding FAR more profit on these these initial debts they're inuring currently. The bills/provisions would have theoretically made it quite literally impossible for any average trader to ever capture the 'full move' (as our fellow in 'the big short' was able to) on failing/financially jeopardized sectors ever again; effectively allowing them to throttle economic transformation, all while the FED is now milking maximum profits out of investors of dying industries before these investors even have a chance to understand that they are invested into a failing industry / company.\n\nNow to begin analysis, in this mass hysteria I have seen a few varying correlations following the real world catalysts which have been in part driving the markets sentiments; correlations which have been getting glossed over here and there, but most posts highlighting them have had their factors barely or overly attributed to the crash in this event. Correlations have been between: speculative currencies (think crypto/ gold - see gold's live chart [here](https://gyazo.com/ad3d69694dd54ec9d0e76f258895c200)) and their ability to gain more strength than the US dollar in the future (relating to an underlying market-sentiment &amp; desire to return to its bullish ways as the value of the US dollar appears to be in jeopardy), the current state of oils price relative to the warmest winter recorded in 20 years and how it impacts our energy sectors in the market, overall playing into the markets sentiment), and the state of the NASDAQ following Friday's close (An underlying desire for bullishness in the markets, specifically in companies which are already extremely prosperous and arguably will only continue to grow more profitable in the LT future of the economy; with a need to begin weeding out the weaker companies in our economy which can be found in the Dow Jones or even still in the S&amp;P 500.) So if you can imagine, each of these three correlations have had major catalysts within the last month which impacted where they stand from a long term perspective and have upcoming catalysts which influence the speed of which they recover and how they do. Essentially I see this playing out as a market recovery that's never been seen before and realistically never could've been seen coming in such a way; ultimately leaving the majority of investors burned &amp; nearly all scratching their head for a period of time to come.\n\nOil is currently at a key tipping point, it's bouncing off of its $20 support and OPEC has a deadline of drawing a resolution by April 1st (It has been reported that US officials have recently been in contact with Russian officials with the desire to reach a conclusion with OPEC &amp; non-OPEC members, reassuring Russia that american companies will also comply with the reduction in oil supply &amp; proposing that other non-OPEC members should do the same.) The drawing of a conclusion is just the catalyst oil is in need off to send it running back up closer to where it was once valued/ a fair price point.. This fuels my belief that oil is truthfully dying out in our countries energy sector (If you look at energy companies listed on the NASDAQ, they're renewable companies, not oil drillers/refineries) and ultimately those which are investing into oil for a long term position will inevitably just be giving their money to the gov't unless they plan to simply swing the catalysts at play currently. {See oils long term chart - [here](https://gyazo.com/81647bd368e7ea096c1521a10f9e1058)}. Notice that oil had almost totally crashed out before the 'Tech bubble' occurrence. I speculate that oil had become most profitable/ most sought after in the late 1900's before new age tech became more and more relevant, there were literally people &amp; companies researching Fuel Cell technology for cars &amp; renewable sources like mainstreaming solar panels; that is, until company heads started dying &amp; I'm sure the gov't/world leaders came together looking for a conclusion, ultimately finding an equilibrium in supply &amp; demand whilst no other competitors were able to threaten them &amp; it seemed everything was playing in their favor, and as a result we can see oil price totally moon leading up to the 2008 recession... This peak is the true foundation for our long term downtrend, renewable energy sources began to rise in relevance and the general population has been so supportive of it that there has been simply been no other choice but to milk the oil industry as much as humanly possible similarly to how someone would play a biotech approval (OPEC meetings, trump pushing to send american oil production to the moon in order to 'make our economy more profitable.' However, it appears to me as a massive pump &amp; dump to trap LT-dividend investors within, slowly draining their net-worth &amp; the income they're receiving in the form of dividends from these companies (Now, a company like Exxon has a WAYS to go before any of the small drilling companies, but on the fundamental principle of oil price slowly draining out over the years, so would these oil/gasoline suppliers/companies - see Exxon LT chart - [here](https://gyazo.com/b375043db48e0144f3cf0b49d9dd4912).) Exxonn set a new high in 2014 and has never been able to recontest this, it's been trapped within a downtrend ever since then, not only that but about the time that oil had completely gone to the moon in the midst of the recession it appears that someone might've opened a short position on Exxon at $117, which is has NEVER touched since then; the closest was in 2014 when it touched $105 / share (the true start of its long term downtrend). Also notable on the chart, despite 'growing revenues' since 2016 exxon/other oil based energy providers haven't been able to create any kind of a LT uptrend which holds solidly in YEARS. This is factor number one in the week ahead imo, when we get news about this/ if a conclusion is able to be drawn by OPEC will be critical within the markets recoveries... CV is literally only playing within the bears favor on really weak handed investors / scalpers at this point; the markets are throwing hella bullish signals &amp; i promise you that the Algos will not be ignoring them in this week to come, which will only act as another elevating factor for the markets in this war to ultimately kill off what seems to be mainstream Bearish vibes from trading communities/ day traders.\n\nTo discuss the NASDAQ - of all the major indexes, the NASDAQ is the only one which doesn't appear to lay in totally bearish territory {[Chart here](https://gyazo.com/5a9eea562ae1992801e50d2c541e7ceb)}. This is what interests me the most, the NASDAQ has bounced off of its up-trending channel that was set in 2016 (the SAME channel which was FINALLY able to break the long term resistance from the Tech Bubble fallout &amp; create a bullish new high along with the rest of the markets at the time - reference the purple line in the image.) Now, the grey line &amp; green trend lines are representative of the 'limitations' and the 'support' of our economies growth following the great recession in 2008... this massive fallout happened just as the NASDAQ had touched this line of resistance, and I believe this recovery will act as a spring board momentum which could send the NASDAQ onto another level. Why do I think this? Because the NASDAQ is comprised of the companies which LITERALLY define the future as we all know it... Heavily loaded Social media companies &amp; innovative tech companies; then only gives way to the top travel agencies (the modern economy has been driven by 'experience' buying more than ever before,) renewable energy companies/prospects, household 'brands' (think pepsi,) banks, the nations top health care companies (yes, some of which will be leading the charge against CV - GILD, Abbott.)\n\nWhat am I trying to say? I believe we are watching the foundation or further development of the transfer of wealth from many LT investors/401K owners into our government's pocket, all while the economy is undergoing a 'silent revolution.' Now this could take years to fully play out, and I believe this is why many economists will continue to look at this event and just scratch their head on what the significance was or why exactly our stock market had a never before seen recovery (Possibly it will be attributed to the common scapegoat at the moment - \"the FED is just printing money until the problems seem to resolve themselves.\") Perhaps more catch on or the event plays out in an extreme fashion as more and more investors seem to read between the lines here &amp; flock to the 'companies of the future' as they continue to increase revenues &amp; outshine their outdated counter parts.)\n\n\"But EXLR8, what about the overhead concerns pertaining to the current condition of the USD value, its strength in an economy, and how it relates to the overall buying power of the consumer?\" Well, to that I would say this concern is barking up the wrong tree, especially with the conditions which are put before us in the articles detailing the fed's 'improvements' in investing strategies.. These strategies totally dismiss any desire for our gov't to back our dollar (per say, adopting the gold standard, or switching to a crypto-currency - view crypto's current 'trend' [here](https://gyazo.com/dfc18132e0c4a67eef22c4eeaac68db0)) because then it would limit their ability to 'adapt' to the severity of the 'situation' presented. Especially while considering how they are handling this process, they aren't printing money which will forever stay in circulation, this money will be put back 'into the reserve with interest' once big investors decide they want to return to their positions; also, if im not mistaken this would even allow for them milk MUCH more money than they've injected into the dying markets by recouping it on short positions. (To clarify, am I bullish on Gold or Crypto? Yes, but they aren't entirely related to the primary factors currently at play, at best these factors just opened the opportunity for a great buy in time on crypto/gold.)\n\nHow does this effect our investing strategy moving forward? Well personally, I'm going to be focusing companies which I see playing a MASSIVE roll in our society's future / will be able to 'keep up with the times.' At least until this situation plays out more, and I'll certainly be on the lookout for anything the market seems to throw at us which appears to disprove this theory. However, currently I haven't found anything which compels me in another direction or to just leave it and say \"ahhh corona-virus is the fall of the US/world economy, I can't invest right now.\"\n\nPieces of further analysis: Current state of the SPY (S&amp;P 500) - [here](https://gyazo.com/bdd2e4e6ee506c2e05ba10b6cffa0488). Key takeaways - Fridays close left us above the long term uptrend established in 2016, which was the trend that pushed our markets into higher highs. The selloff seen this month was quite literally the most dramatic EVER seen, worse than the height of the 2008 sell off, and FAR worse than at any point during 'the tech bubble.' I view key support as \\~247, and while the bears have been screaming about the looming 'death cross' I don't think algo's or investors will give a damn about that one indicator, especially given the hype that will be generated following the clearing of OPEC's deal this week... (I believe the closing of the OPEC deal will give the oil sector enough of a relief to ignite buying within various other sectors/companies that appear equiped to overcome the quarantine period / appear as tho they can come out on top of their industry/niche.) Example 2 of a dying sector - [VIAC](https://gyazo.com/a31664d0ad2e2d8aebe12767c8d1f66f). VIAC had been a major company which many investors thought 'could never fail.' However, look at the LT downtrend it has been stuck in since 2014; which directly correlates to the rise of streaming platforms (NFLX) which was a power house even before the 2008 crash, and surfaced as the 'heavy weight champion' of mediums which people watch television (not to mention much more profitable than traditional TV/Movie networks - NFLX charges a premium to use their service AND profits from promotion / adds put on their platform, andddd not to mention they're literally sourcing their own material at this point, cutting back on production costs that typical TV stations would incur.) Example of dying sector 3 - [PEI](https://gyazo.com/40f9293dd4006979f8648e83de9306d3). PEI is a real-estate investment trust which specializes in the leasing/development/etc of shopping malls... Again, has been stuck in a long time downtrend (Like most Real-estate investing trusts that aren't specializing in residential renting.) since shopping malls have been becoming practically obsolete in the recent years, especially with the rise of Amazon &amp; other similar companies.\n\nThis week: Suspecting a slow bleed monday/tuesday, or at least until the OPEC deal is struck.. Gold &amp; crypto will see early movement as the DXY continues to drop; and upon release of the opec news it will ignite a frenzy of buying across the oil sectors. Effectively pulling the indexes up enough off of their supports enough to promote buying amidst various other sectors (which have beautiful intra-day technicals right now), essentially creating a chain reaction throughout the markets as plenty of whales have been sitting on the sidelines, starring at discounted tickers, wondering if this is the dip.\n\nLT: My projections would lead me to believe this will be a market recovery never seen before; not one of a traditional recession, not one of a depression, and not entirely a 'V' shape.. following this next round 'relief' the bears will be eager to secure some kinda of gains, and those sectors which are truthfully dying will be seeing some of the most dramatic jumps in pricing which will end up pulling index pricing into strange directions... not anything crazy dramatic, but talking the NASDAQ-100 up 1% while the SPY &amp; DJI continue to lag behind  by -.5% loses; essentially laying the groundwork for the potential of a 'reverse tech bubble.' Perhaps in the weeks to come we see another slew of frenzy sell offs in various sectors based around insane indexes, creating one last major dip before another bullish recovery as the prospering sectors help ignite buying from 'LT investors / Firms' in the dying sectors, overall pulling the indexes up in another dramatic fashion.  Perhaps, welcome to the future.",

        "selftext": "Fellow geniuses, let me guide you through what many will consider a totally inept analysis of the virus impact.\n\nFirst, I am not a \"permabear\" despite many bearish posts and comments. However, I was already bearish prior to this virus, thinking the party had gone on too long and we needed a correction. It would be nice for   people not to lose money, and everything be great, however I am a realist.\n\n*TL;DR: This virus is here for awhile and that will impact consumer behavior longer than just a few months. Even with a cure or vaccine, the emotional toll of having to deal with the seasonal flu, plus coronavirus, could take years to normalize. The economic impact will be substantial.*\n\n**'This virus is going to be with us'**\n\n&gt;I'm hopeful that we'll get through  this *first wave* and, and have some time to prepare for the *second wave*.  I'm hopeful that the private sector in its ingenuity and working with the government, NIH, will develop a vaccine that ultimately will change the impact of this virus. \n\n&gt;But for the next ***24 months***, you know, we're all in this together, and the most important thing  that we can do  is twofold: the American public fully embracing the  social distancing that we requested to protect the vulnerable; and secondly, to operationalize the bread and butter of public health, you know, early case identification, isolation, contact tracing, so that this outbreak does not get the upper hand, as it has, unfortunately, in New York City, in northern New Jersey, and now New Orleans.- CDC  Director\n\n[CDC Director - This Virus Will Be With Us](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/31/824155179/cdc-director-on-models-for-the-months-to-come-this-virus-is-going-to-be-with-us)\n\nThis is not going away after the first wave. We will have a second wave,  and  most likely another after that. We all know the flu by itself kills tens of thousands annually, even with a vaccine available for years.\n\nPeople are used to the Flu, it has been with us for a long time. But it still kills many people worldwide each year. Now, imagine adding a new virus that we are all scared of to every flu season. If you did not get it   during the first wave, you probably don't want to get it in the second or third. *This fear will greatly impact many people's behavior*. How they travel, spend, etc, and this will impact the economy for an extended length of time.\n\n**One in three Americans say a household member has been laid off or had their pay cut**\n\n&gt;Fully a third of Americans have someone in their household who\u2019s been  laid off or lost pay. The economic and humanitarian damage here is    incredibly widespread, even more than the unemployment claims data suggests. \n\n&gt;The Google Trends data  is especially alarming right now, because searches for \u201cfile for unemployment\u201d are far, far higher than they were in the depths of the  Great Recession.\n\n&gt;Two economists, the University of Minnesota\u2019s Aaron Sojourner and Yale\u2019s Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, have [built a model for predicting unemployment claims](https://www.epi.org/blog/coronavirus-record-breaking-spike-in-ui-claims/) based on news reports. Their [initial model](https://www.epi.org/blog/coronavirus-record-breaking-spike-in-ui-claims/) nearly nailed the 3.3 million number, predicting 3.4 million new claims. They [now project 4.7 million new claims](https://twitter.com/paulgp/status/1243204614125649924) for the week ending March 27, a huge spike from an already record number.\n\n[Vox - Economic Number](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/30/21184401/coronavirus-covid-19-economy-charts)\n\nEven with government checks and recovery money, many of these companies and jobs won't come back. Weak businesses, the small mom and pop types, who  were already struggling, won't make it through this. *Unemployment will remain elevated longer than some anticipate.*\n\nWe had already seen a shift to many people working for themselves, also known as the gig economy. Many of these people are either already unemployed or will remain underemployed for months, if not years. This   includes everyone from subcontractors, to your self employed business owners.\n\nMultiple articles have popped up about different industries that are seeing an impact. Here are a few  mentioned recently:\n\n* Ridesharing (Uber, Lift, Scooters, Bikes)\n* Restaurants (Chains, Bars, mom and pop, food trucks)\n* Wedding Industry (Venues, Caterers, Photographers, Florists)\n* Gambling (Casinos, Online, Vegas)\n* Sports (Local indoor fields, gyms, rinks, youth sports, local leagues, races)\n* Travel (Hotels, Airbnb, Airlines, Airports, Planners, Cruises, Tours, Cities)\n* Oil (Certain States, companies, WTI)\n* Retail (Malls, Local Independent Stores, some chains)\n* Motion Picture (Studios, Labor, Theater)\n* Home Services (Landscapers, Small Construction, Builders)\n* Personal Services (Barbers, Spas, Salons, Pet Care, Child Care, Nannies, Home Health Aids)\n* Real Estate (2nd homes, Rentals, Realtors)\n* Music &amp; Arts (Concerts, Galleries, Venues)\n* Auto (local dealers, new cars, big 3)\n\n**34% GDP Plunge**\n\n&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects the U.S. economy to experience a far deeper slump than previously anticipated as the coronavirus pandemic hammers  businesses, causing a wave of mass unemployment.\n\n&gt;The  world\u2019s largest  economy will shrink an annualized ***34%***   in the second  quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 24%, economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a report. Unemployment will soar to *15%* by mid-year, up from a  previous forecast of 9%, they wrote.\n\n&gt;The economists, however, now expect a  stronger recovery in the third quarter, with gross domestic product  expanding 19%.\u201cOur estimates imply that a bit more than half of the  near-term output  decline is made up by year-end,\u201d they wrote. While  there\u2019s a risk of   longer-term fallout on income and spending, the  aggressive action by the Federal Reserve and the government should  help to contain this.\n\n[Goldman Sees Deeper Plunge](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sees-even-deeper-u-080522193.html)\n\n34% is just a massive impact. They do expect a strong recovery (as do  many)  but it still won't immediately make up for the total hit we will  take. One can't help but wonder how much of this won't go away, and how  long  it will take to get back on track.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe will get out of this and life will return to normal. However, those calling bottoms, and talking V shape recovery in only a month or so may be shortsighted. People will spend less going forward, impacting all   areas of the economy. The emotional and financial toll of this virus may take years to fully normalize.\n\nPosition: Overall outlook for the next few months or so is bearish, despite the irrational exuberance of the bulls this past week.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is just a random opinion from some average guy locked in his house drinking copious amounts of coffee. Do your own DD and form your own  opinion.*\n\n*I did not dig into lots of other areas in this post. Other things to look at or consider; EM, China data, Oil, Europe, Debt, Future World  Virus  Spread, etc..*",

However, I\u2019d just like to warn people about who their donating to. Just like buying options and stocks, do some DD on the charity you are donating to.  \n\nTake the charity Autism Speaks (I\u2019ll just call it AS) for example.  \n\nMy gf is currently [Miss Thousand Islands](http://tripleaautism.com/) and is going to be running for Miss New York and her initiative is about Adaptation and Awareness for Autism. She was initially backing the charity AS, but has learned (after speaking with several people in the Autism community) that a lot of people in the autism community actually detest AS.\n\nWhy?  AS is a charity dedicated to curing autism rather than teaching acceptance and kindness towards autistic people. Their commercials are literally aimed at creating fear of arising and misinforming the public into donating for them. Yes, Autism speaks states that they have changed their mission statement and objective in 2016, but old habit die hard. They're still putting out offensive ads that promote hate and fear towards autism. ([More Info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkOj6wirto))\n\nAn alternative? [Autism Self Advocacy Network](https://www.autismacceptancemonth.com/)\n\nADDITIONALLY, Miss Thousand Islands is having a difficult time getting the support that she needs. If you would like to, please [donate to help her](https://www.missamericaforkids.org/Contestant/francescadalessandro) fund her entrance fees to Miss New York so that I can educate on my initiative and tour on a national level.\n\nTl,dr: Literally the title. Do your DD on the charities your are donating to. Some of them are bad\n\nTl,dr 2: [Donate to Miss Thousand Island](https://www.missamericaforkids.org/Contestant/francescadalessandro) who is promoting Adaptation and Awareness for Autism",

An era of new technologies, purchased on credit by workers whose wages remain unchanged. An ever widening wage gap. A manipulated market that seems only to move up, eventually disconnecting from the fundamentals of the underlying economy. A surge in volume as people buy in on margin. A pro business president that vows not to interfere with business. Some things never change.\n\nOne interesting difference was that back in the 20s the bankers stepped in to provide credit/liquidity to keep the market moving up because the fed refused to do it. Well, this record long bull market just met the mother of all downturns. I think everyone needs to brush up on their history because we can't use 2008 as a precedent.",

        "selftext": "After my last post, I had multiple people asking if I could take a deeper look into the renewable energy industry. Since I\u2019m also very interested and I feel it will become a very important sector, I took the time to review it. First of all, let me explain why investing now is a good time. \n\nWhen you look at manufacturers, the biggest market cap is not even $5 billion. There is so much room for growth and there\u2019s also a lot of competition. When you can point your finger at the best company, it might be the homerun for your portfolio in 10-15 years. Even if you don\u2019t hit the right one, it\u2019s still gonna be ok since the industry is only growing. To be clear, I only looked at manufacturers, not distributors. You won\u2019t see any companies like NEE, DUK, BEP, etc. \n\nSecondly, you all know Trump doesn\u2019t believe in environmentally issues, renewable energy and that sort of stuff. With elections coming up, investments might stay the same or they might go up drastically when the democrats win. Either way, the sector will continue to grow and you can\u2019t really go bad with investing in it. \n\nLast argument, I feel like a lot of people don\u2019t know the importance of solar energy yet. It goes beyond the industry, as it gets implemented more and more by other industries. It\u2019s already a big item for giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon,\u2026 to keep their cloud servers running for example. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nIn this post, I will focus on solar energy the most, as it is the biggest and most important part of renewable energy. Based on market cap from the solar industry, we have 3 leaders and 7 others on a significant distance, but still able to get to the top for the next 5-10 years. From that top 10, RUN, SPWR and VSLR fall off based on financials.  \n\n**ENPH**  \nMarket leader on micro-inverters (the things that convert solar charge into electricity). Even their inverters get used by big competitors like SPWR. Investing more and more into energy storage. It\u2019s focussing on the private market, which might be a short term problem, but their inverters are definitely their big win. Not only do they receive revenue from their own installations, but they have other companies using their products as well when installing other products, making ENPH techniques present in an enormous amount of solar installations. The financials are great, they have a decent amount of cash to get investing and they\u2019re only profitable since last year, giving them a lot of room to grow. They\u2019re bound to get number one position in solar tech and they didn\u2019t even launch their best technology yet. \n\n**SEDG**  \nGreat financials as well. Assets over double amount of liabilities, almost no long term debt and enough cash to get growing. Very big growth on revenue. They were planning to even double their production in 2020 and release some new products, but that\u2019s gonna be delayed a bit. They are working with TSLA on batteries and charging stations. It all looks very positive, although I have to point out some people are calling SEDG \u2018yesterday\u2019s solution\u2019. It might be up and keep growing a lot, but if you want the best 10 year investment, you should stick with ENPH. \n\n**FSLR**  \nVery inconsistent income, but a great balance sheet. Assets 3 times liabilities and loads of cash to get investing into the future. Their profit margins are pretty small though, in comparison to the industry. FSLR is the only company that works with utility companies to provide energy. To draw you a simple picture: if you get electric energy at home, it\u2019s been delivered by utility companies and the energy itself is mostly created by FSLR. Over the past few years, utilities are losing market share because people are buying and setting up their own energy installations at home. Therefore utilities, and by extension FSLR, are losing market share. Because of the crisis, people will be less likely to install their own installations as unemployment numbers are rising. FSLR could be the better short term bet, but it\u2019s hard to predict when it will turn around again and they will definitely lose long term. \n\n**JKS**  \nVery innovative techniques, one of the most efficient solar panels on the market. Therefore gaining a lot of advantage on their competitors, or \u2018moat\u2019 by Warren Buffett terms. If you feel like solar panels are the most important part of the industry, I would definitely suggest looking into JinkoSolar. They have a lot of cash to get investing, low on long term debt and I see them coming the closest to top 3 in the future.\n\n**CSIQ**  \nLooking for value, then this is the one. PEG ratio of only 0.19, the industrial average is 0.68. Have to point out as well that their growth rate isn\u2019t that great and you might wait a long long time to get the gains going on this one. They also have a lawsuit running against them, claiming to steal Solaria\u2019s patented module technology. \n\n**NOVA**  \nThey might get hit hard by covid-19. Sunnova is a pretty young company, full on investing and expanding, thus having low cash reserves. They might need to be backed by bailout money, putting them even further behind the top 5 solar companies. When they get back in 1-2 years, I feel like the other companies will have too much of a head start. \n\n**AZRE**  \nThey have experienced almost no impact from covid-19 as an Indian based company. Their projects have not been impacted and the plants are running full force. However there has been significant reduction in demand and they\u2019ve been seeing delayed payments from customers. It operates like First Solar, selling energy to government utilities. Big profit margins as well, so they might get out of this crisis easily. That\u2019s also the main reason why the stock didn\u2019t drop that much. Growth will be limited, but a stable investment. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nNext, I\u2019m gonna mention some other renewable energy resources. I took one of the best companies per industry as an example, but I\u2019m not gonna go through those resources more deeply as I don\u2019t believe in them.\n\n**VWDRY**  \nThe wind energy industry is more inconsistent than solar energy, therefore not the most favorable kind of resource to invest in. It also doesn\u2019t have real potential to expand to private use, but whoever wants to invest in it, I suggest VWDRY. It is the biggest company in the world in terms of wind power. Apart from having the most and biggest wind farms, they also offer their maintenance and knowledge to help optimizing other wind farm locations. Vestas also just signed a great contract with a Danish energy company for delivery in the upcoming next years. They have a lot of cash ready to invest and they also have decent value, so you can\u2019t really go wrong with them.\n\n**REGI**  \nREGI produces and sells biofuels and renewable chemicals. It produces biomass-based diesel, using corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat amongst other things. The company might be in bad weather, as they are low on cash. They are operating in an investment needing industry, so it\u2019s definitely not the right moment for a financial crisis like this.\n\nAs you can see, I didn\u2019t include nuclear energy companies. Nuclear energy is a green energy solution and definitely isn\u2019t bad. However it\u2019s not growing like solar and wind because it has a lot of negative feedback and image. There is more waste, it\u2019s more expensive and therefore also less investments. It\u2019s easy math, the more volume, the lower price. No one is investing in nuclear, so pricing can\u2019t compete with other resources. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nFor me, this research was surprising. I was expecting to find more small companies with breaking innovative techniques, but it seems like the ones at the top are predicted to stay there and increase distance. If anyone has some valuable information on small companies, definitely share them in this thread.\n\nTo conclude, ENPH and SEDG are without a doubt the best investments right now. Depending on your timeline, you might want to sell SEDG in 5-10 years, while keeping ENPH for a lifetime. JKS is the higher risk, higher reward kinda bet here, with still decent coverage of risk.\n\nThere are of course way more other renewable energy resources, but I don\u2019t know enough about them. If I would start researching them, I might be working like a professional broker/investor and I decided that I\u2019ve put enough energy into stock research the past weeks. Right now, I\u2019m gonna enjoy the weather, work a bit in the garden and passively buy some shares this week with all that info I\u2019ve gathered over the past few months.",

        "selftext": "Hello Ladies &amp; Gents,\n\nThe market has truly been something over the past month and a half and seems to be riding on emotions and other plays rather so than fundamentals, even though market usually tends to be forward looking. Back in early March, I did my research and decided on a portfolio of stocks to go with as I believe in their growth. As is, I decided to play it out over time and DCA whenever it hits lows. So as search, I\u2019ve only been able to deploy only about 10-15% of my cash so far and only have a few shares of some stocks. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s been going up, but now what should I do? I keep waiting and it keeps going up and it becomes further and further away from the targets I really wanted. I still think there is still some downs to come, but not sure if   It will go back to those same levels. So far my portfolio is as below:\n\n3 shares MSFT @ $136.90\n2 shares AAPL @ $239\n1 share TSLA @ $478\n10 shares AMD @ $37.70\n5 shares DIS @ 93\n3 shares SQ @ $43\n6 shares V @ $151\n25 shares AC.TO @ $15.35\n3 shares TD.TO @ $54\n11 shares RBC.TO @ $92\n30 shares DEAC @ $16.60\n25 shares ENPH @ $36.62 \n\nI\u2019m looking to add specifically more of the first 7 stocks, not sure what to do at this point. I\u2019m glad I was able to get in at least at the lows but just not enough because of my plan to DCA, and just waited and waited.",

        "selftext": "I am 19 years old and below is a couple companies I think are great buys at this point in time. Open to any opinions. I welcome any other companies that you think are great buys.\n\n\nThe list below is my growth stocks\n\nAMD = This company has established its presence in the processor industry. In the past year, they have reported their best earnings ever. They have a lot more room to grow.\nAAPL = Apple products will keep growing especially with 5G technology in their new phones. They are an extremely popular company and they have done a good job in diversifying their revenues sources. \nBA = Boing is a company that has a very big reputation that has been bashed for lots of errors. Their price is very attractive and I don't think this company is going anywhere, the government has contracted with them and won't let them go under.\nENPH =  Endphase is a renewable energy company based off of solar production. They are relatively new and are already turning a profit. Their financials are solid and I believe the importance of renewable energy will only grow.\nYUM = Yum has is an incredible corporation of fast food companies that are very popular in the US. Their price has taken a big hit and I see solid returns in the long term.\nBYND = Beyond produces food that is environmentally friendly. This trend of eating fake meat is growing and is displayed by fast-food chains selling this fake meat. In a way, this is a renewable energy company because of the meat production industry which is terrible for the environment.\nMAXR = Maxar technologies, in my opinion, is extremely undervalued. They are currently at $10 and was previously at $80. They have reached bottom support, I am not as confident in this company as my other ones on this list.\nTSLA = Tesla exemplifies how clean energy is going to be the next biggest thing. Tesla is expensive but everyone in the world knows what Tesla is because it is groundbreaking. Tesla is powerful because everyone and their mother thinks it is cool.\nAQN = Also a company that engages in energy. They have been minimally affected by the stock market dropping. They have deeply invested in renewable energy and are relatively new. They are turning a profit.\nVSLR = This is a riskier renewable energy stock. They are very new and have a lot to prove. Their price has been destroyed by the drop from $11 to $4.8, they also have very strong buy recommendations from multiple analysts. Big potential for this solar company.\nATVI = Activision is a company that makes very popular video games and has a big influence on young kids. Video games are only growing in popularity. Their balance sheet is incredible and they have been performing well because everyone is playing games and their release of COD.  \nMSFT = Microsoft is a monster of a company and has built a moat between them and their competition. They are well known and very consistent.\nBABA = The Amazon of China only recently added on the US stock market. They have incredible year over year growth and outstanding buy recommendations from over 50 analysts.\n\nETF's\n\nQQQ = A great measure of the market that is more weight on technology than the SPY\nSPY = Can't go wrong with this\nXAR = ETF based on space technology and defense. As technology grows humans will want to explore the possibilities of space more. War is a part of life, so is the money-making part of it.\n\nDividend Growth is below \n\nTGT = Excellent company that is doing a great job transferring onto the internet world.\nABT = Aristocrat legend\nWMT = Same thing as a target. Such a resilient price that the stock market drop has done virtually nothing to them.\nMCD = Who doesn't love a happy meal.\nDIS = Stock price has been absolutely destroyed. This company isn't going anywhere. They have been advancing by creating new movies and streaming services. Kids love Disney Fantasy.",

        "selftext": "I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR. Stonks only go up.",

        "selftext": "I've called 3 major reversals and 1 short term one last week (check my post history) and I'm here to tell you we might be in for another major reversal.\n\nPrice has attempted, three times, to break resistance at SPY 264. 264 is a super significant number, and it's very typical for price to get stuck at a significant number and reverse at said super significant number.\n\nFirst, $264 is the 200 Week moving average. The 200 week moving average has been support for this entire bull market - 9 fucking years!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qe68eao0jbr41.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2640b176655d0341604e956532613eed2af27490\n\nSecond, it's the .382 Fib of the entire price decline from the all time high. The two line up perfectly. When a structural support and a major fib line up, it's like wearing two condoms during gay sex - little jimmy has to work way harder to impregnate your boyfriend's sister's husband.\n\n![img](7od46vbjibr41 \"Second, it's the .382 Fib of this entire decline.\n\")\n\nNow look at the price action: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6be97modjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ddf004701b380f9f67e8ec6f3797dea975dd4a\n\nIn a bull market, this would be hella bullish price action - price banging on the door, eventually breaking it down. But we're not in a bull market are we? Hellllll no we're not.\n\nIn a bull market, an impulse gap like the one we had this morning above a previous short term trend of the previous move (see the red line drawn from the ATH) would be on high volume.\n\nCheck out this pitiful volume today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwkoouzxjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e55cad6e16a52e32f68c14a581211ce8222f05d0\n\nJust sad, sad volume for a gap impulse.\n\nFinally, factor in where we closed. RIGHT at the 200 weekly MA. Not above it. the final minute saw HUGE sell volumes into the close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v71xmxsbkbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a134ebbc82de1050f2cd145df0e8dacb25a577\n\nNow look, I'm not saying price can't continue up further. It absolutely could. There have been enormous short positioned established in the past two weeks which will put upward pressure on prices and could carry price to $270-280 if we break above $264 with high volume.\n\nBUT, if we fail here for the THIRD time. The selling is going to be absolutely vicious. 20 day realized volatility is 100. ONE FUCKING HUNDRED. UNFUCKING PRECEDENTED. The VIX is currently at 43 after a 7% SPY move. These are unfuckingprecedented times people.\n\nLike all TA gays, I'm here to tell you that price could go up, but there's an absolutely beautiful technical setup for a massive implosion.",

Gap days are usually harder to trade. Most large gaps in the market get sold off at open but occasionally they do hold so be aware and stay patient.  As of right now the SPY is holding this temporary support and trying to form a \"W\" pattern but the weekly 200 moving average is still overhead and that's where it got rejected last week. Day to day basis right now until we get out of this range. If market breaks back below last weeks low most likely we will see a retest of the lows, if it breaks above the weekly 200 ma we could see some continuation to the upside as earnings season starts in 2 weeks. Only time will tell.  Almost no stocks moving with individual catalyst. If you are new, this is not the ideal time to trade so don't get fomo, just be patient and only take solid trades with good patterns and have a defined risk to reward before entering trades.

Go on Amazon. Not only does Hasbro own the majority of the first few pages of results for toys and board games, they barely have any inventory left. This is despite their [CEO stating that their supply chain in China was back up and running three weeks ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-hasbro-shares-soar-as-ceo-cites-great-demand-for-toys.html) and that they would be fully caught up by April. You'll see similar patterns on Target's website, especially if you try for in-store pickup.\n\nWe saw a [Christmas level spike](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=board%20games) in searches for board games, which are surprisingly a [larger portion of Hasbro's revenue than you'd think](https://hasbro.gcs-web.com/static-files/2e4dbabd-a54f-4253-a80e-f0a60a83bdaf). People are so bored at home they're buying board games they're never even going to play.\n\nObviously, the majority of Hasbro's revenue is from toys, and demand for these is largely driven by the success of their partnerships with movie studios (read: Disney). How many Frozen toys do you think [50 million Disney+ subscribers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/disney-plus-50-million-subscribers.html) works out to? Hell they may even make a little bit off that [shitty Trolls movie](https://deadline.com/2020/04/trolls-world-tour-record-digital-weekend-opening-day-1202906947/). Regardless, the #1 driver of demand right now is kids sitting at home with absolutely nothing to do but watch movies and demand the respective toys. Through its partnerships, Hasbro owns that market (although somehow they didn't have [Baby Yoda](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/21/21146913/baby-yoda-animatronic-toy-hasbro-release-date-price-mandalorian-star-wars-disney) ready to go the day Mandalorian dropped).\n\nNow let's look at the stock itself. Hasbro had a strong 2019 and appeared to be rebounding from losing Toys R Us before missing Q3 earnings. However, they rebounded from this in Q4 and were back to comfortably trading in the $100-105 area (down from around $120 in Q3) even with concerns about their supply chain due to that weird virus in China. Then the virus came here, and they dropped like everyone else, bottoming out at $41. They've bounced back to some degree, trading at $75 now, but fundamentally, there's no reason they shouldn't be trading at pre-virus numbers. Their supply chain is back up, toys actually [perform relatively well](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/industries-thrive-on-recession.asp) during a recession, and the whole world has more leisure time than at any point in the past century. Also, one could argue that losing Toys R Us was the best thing for Hasbro long term because it [pushed them to actually embrace e-commerce](https://nypost.com/2019/02/20/hasbro-lego-launch-online-services-in-toys-r-us-absence/). They're arguably set up better than just about anyone for this exact scenario, yet they're trading at 21% below their 200 day MA. While similar at-home leisure goods (video games, fucking Peloton, etc) are at or near ATHs, their cheaper and more inelastic peer, Hasbro, is being treated like any other consumer product.\n\nHasbro will report earnings on 4/29, but Mattel, their closest competitor, will report on 4/23. If everything I've laid out here bears any weight, I believe $MAT will crush Q1 expectations and the market will quickly realize that $HAS will benefit from this virus even more (more diversified product line, stronger studio partnerships).\n\nThe biggest concern here is option volume. If you buy all this, you'll have to pay a premium to get in on it. Obviously volume will increase as we get closer to earnings, but I believe getting in before Mattel releases their numbers on 4/23 will be key. Secondary concern is supply chain, but honestly, even if there were a second outbreak in China, do we really believe they're going to let that shut down manufacturing again, and even if so, in the next two weeks? Hard to believe, but if that does happen, none of us will care because all our puts will finally print.\n\nI'm not putting a strike because you're better off finding the right price given low volume. Basically any call after 4/29. Right now I'm thinking $95 by mid-May.",

They're basic beginner plays but I've made a mixture of profits and losses the last two weeks despite doing my own DD and making mostly high probability plays. So I'm wondering there is a blind spot in my thinking.\n\n1) USO shares with covered calls. I am still debating the covered calls portion. But it would be easy at this price point to load up on shares and ride what I suspect will be an eventual rise or rip. The only thing is that USO is so politics so any TA (I do basic bar chart pattern reading and using MA, nothing more) is useless. \n\n2) DAL puts for earnings. Warrent Buffet just pulled out. All the airlines are taking a hit. I know DAL has already fallen a lot but Warren buying and selling had a history of creating trends in the same direction. I'm expecting another sell off. I could hedge though with a straddle at it's current price and try to catch options before their premium rockets. One thing I haven't checked is exactly when their earnings will be announced. If it is after market on Thursday, with good friday closed, that won't work. IV will sink by the time markets open.",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot even the best fintech stock in the decade after the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009 could hide from the coronavirus. **Mastercard** (NYSE: MA), the world's second-largest dedicated digital payments platform, has been hit hard by the contagion. At its lowest point last month, the stock was down over 40% from its all-time high, although as of this writing, it has recovered some of those losses.\n\nNevertheless, the coming economic downturn means less movement of money. For a toll-booth business like Mastercard that earns the bulk of its revenue by charging a small fee for processing transactions, that means leaner times lie immediately ahead. \u00a0\n\nThough the world has undeniably changed a great deal because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mastercard is in good shape and should emerge stronger than ever. The short-term outlook isn't great, and shares remain priced at a premium, but the long-term reasons for owning this war-on-cash leader are unchanged.\n\nTear up those 2020 forecasts\n\nEven after toppling from its highs, Mastercard stock still trades at a premium price point: 36 times trailing 12-month free cash flow (what's left after cash operating expenses and capital expenditures are paid out). It's an especially high price considering the company added itself to the large and growing list of businesses downgrading expectations for the coming year. Management pulled its outlook for full-year 2020 revenue (previously pegged at a low-teens percentage increase) and downgraded its first-quarter 2020 revenue guidance to low single-digit percentage growth. Operating expenses should grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range, which includes the $250 million Mastercard pledged to support small businesses impacted by the coronavirus.\n\nThat could imply very little growth in earnings -- or even a bottom-line contraction if operating expenses grow significantly faster than revenue. With the stock priced as if Mastercard will continue growing at a fast but steady clip for the foreseeable future, suffice it to say coronavirus and the disruption it has brought on the world is unwelcome news.\n\nThe war on cash was never going to be won in a year\n\nNevertheless, a bad quarter or even an entire year is no reason to part ways with a long-term winner like Mastercard. Ample profitability means the credit card and payments platform will be able to navigate the crisis without the need to take on new debt. This isn't just a short-term trend either. As digital payments have grown as a percentage of the global transaction pie, profit margins have steadily gone up.\n\nPlus, digital payments are still a high-growth industry. Global revenue generated is expected to climb by high single-digit percentages for the next few years, according to McKinsey and Company. Most of the world still deals primarily in cash, so there's plenty of room for companies like Mastercard to continue making the push toward a more digitally based system of money movement. The company's immediate-term outlook, though lowered significantly, is a testament to that. Many organizations are foreseeing a drop in sales, but Mastercard is still looking at year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Some of that pertains to the acquisitions made in recent years, and more takeovers could be in the making. The outlook could also change in subsequent quarters, but at this point in the crisis, it's so far, so good. \u00a0\n\nAnd then, there's the situation with China. Long walled off to foreign payment platforms, Mastercard got approval in early 2020 from the People's Bank of China to begin setting up operations. Entering the massive country -- home to the world's largest base of digital consumers -- will be an uphill battle against the virtual duopoly on the Chinese digital payments market between **Alibaba**\u00a0and **Tencent**.\u00a0But Mastercard is still generating plenty of growth from other emerging markets. China should thus be a notable addition that could help maintain growth for many more years.\n\nA premium price for a best-in-class company\n\nAs a final consideration, Mastercard ended 2019 with $8.53 billion in debt, not a huge sum considering this payments giant generated $7.46 billion in free cash flow last year. Additionally, cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet totalled $7.68 billion. High-profit margins, plenty of liquidity, and global secular trends favouring the industry it plays in add up to make Mastercard a best-in-class fintech stock.\n\nThe price tag on shares remains high and the immediate outlook uncertain as to the world reels from the effects of the pandemic, but Mastercard is still a staple portfolio holding for the long term.",

(decreases shortage associated limitations on financials) \n\n\\- Already has a collection/deployment model, given companies already have established contracts with hospitals for IVIG (convalescent plasma)\n\n\\- Is easy to use for Doctors (it is a simple IV infusion)\n\n\\- Biochemically makes the most amount of sense to be an effective treatment as it provides direct targeting of the virus by the immune system and shortcuts vaccine therapies. \n\nCaveats: Unproven medical treatment with true \u2018proof\u2019 likely months away. Risk of unexpected negative results in studies contradicting previously done studies. \n\nUpside: Overall seemingly limited risk with high reward potential with organic financial revenue growth compounded by likely emotional piling-in phenomenom as more people learn about the treatment. Downside technically limited by baseline company financials. \n\nConcise list of other COVID-19 treatment options/companies: [https://www.av.co/covid](https://www.av.co/covid)\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n\u201cBuy before the news is out, then sell the news\u201d: Buy short dates calls now, media is starting to shift it\u2019s focus on convalescent plasma as the \u2018next big thing\u2019 in treatment for SARS-CoV2/COVID19 which will drive up associated stock prices in aforementioned companies (TAK, GRFS, CSL, etc) from emotional drive/FOMO. Likely leading to a wild upswing with eventual downward pressure once people realize they\u2019ll have to wait awhile for larger study publications. (Risky high upside, moderate down side from baseline financials and general market pressure)\n\n\u201cWait for the Research\u201d: Long term I am favoring that research will be positive for this as it pans out. This will lead to increased revenue streams for the associated companies long term. Target companies with long dated calls who derive most of their income from convalescent plasma, leading to better long term financial growth as they add this treatment into their portfolio. (High risk high reward on IVIG focused companies \\[GRFS, CSLLY\\], lower reward but smaller risk on diversified companies \\[TAK\\])\n\nSources:\n\n1.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Happy Thursday to all! Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday\u2019s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank\u2019s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street\u2019s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It\u2019s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won\u2019t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That\u2019s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state\u2019s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference the outbreak could \u201cstabilize\u201d within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That\u2019s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* USO\n* CLVS\n* DIS\n* APA\n* OXY\n* COST\n* PFE\n* SBUX\n* ATRC\n* YELP\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** \u2013 Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Happy Thursday to all! Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday\u2019s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank\u2019s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street\u2019s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It\u2019s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won\u2019t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That\u2019s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state\u2019s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference the outbreak could \u201cstabilize\u201d within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That\u2019s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* USO\n* CLVS\n* DIS\n* APA\n* OXY\n* COST\n* PFE\n* SBUX\n* ATRC\n* YELP\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** \u2013 Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Happy Thursday to all! Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday\u2019s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank\u2019s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street\u2019s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It\u2019s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won\u2019t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That\u2019s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state\u2019s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference the outbreak could \u201cstabilize\u201d within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That\u2019s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* USO\n* CLVS\n* DIS\n* APA\n* OXY\n* COST\n* PFE\n* SBUX\n* ATRC\n* YELP\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** \u2013 Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.

Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank\u2019s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street\u2019s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It\u2019s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won\u2019t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That\u2019s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state\u2019s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference the outbreak could \u201cstabilize\u201d within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That\u2019s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* USO\n* CLVS\n* DIS\n* APA\n* OXY\n* COST\n* PFE\n* SBUX\n* ATRC\n* YELP\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** \u2013 Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.
