        "selftext": "A UK court has approved an over \u00a310 billion ($14 billion) class action suit against financial services corporation Mastercard for overcharging fees to millions of British consumers using their credit cards for payments.\n\nBritain\u2019s first mass consumer class action suit with 46 million claimants was brought by former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which formally approved it to proceed to trial on Wednesday.\n\nThe case will be probed under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which entitles claimants, both consumers and small businesses, to compensation for Mastercard\u2019s alleged anti-competitive behavio\n\n\u201c*Mastercard has thrown everything at trying to prevent this claim going forward, but today its efforts have failed*,\u201d Merricks said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nMerricks alleges that the global payments system charged unreasonably high interchange fees between May 1992 and June 2008, which resulted in higher prices for consumers and violated EU competition laws. The fees in question are paid by retailers to card-issuing companies when consumers use their cards to shop. The class action suit has been brought on behalf of all individuals over 16 years of age who bought goods and services from UK businesses via Mastercard in the specified period.\n\nThe CAT has not, however, included Merrick\u2019s claim for compound interest and claims from the estates of consumers who died between 1992 and 2008 in the case. According to Mastercard, this reduced the claim\u2019s size to around \u00a310 billion from the initial \u00a315 billion. The company is hopeful that further proceedings will cut the overall claim even more.\n\n\u201c*The decision reduces the value of this spurious claim by more than 35%. Mastercard is confident that over the coming months a review of key facts will further significantly reduce the size and viability of the claim,*\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nMerricks said the CAT ruling \u201c*heralds the start of an era of consumer-focused class actions which will help to hold big business to account in areas that really matter.*\u201d\n\nNo date has been set for the trial yet. Previously, the European Commission ruled that Mastercard interchange fees violated the EU\u2019s competition law in 2007.\n\n[https://www.rt.com/business/532471-mastercard-class-action-lawsuit-uk/](https://www.rt.com/business/532471-mastercard-class-action-lawsuit-uk/)",

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n\n\t\u2022\tJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n\n\t\u2022\tJan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n\n\t\u2022\tApril 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n\n\t\u2022\tApril 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1;

This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe).\n\n\t\u2022\tJuly 26 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair &amp; Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe\u2019s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel.\n\n\t\u2022\tJuly 27 \u2014 Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe\u2019s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 2 \u2014 Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe\u2019s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n* \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n(1) see institutional ownership (WSB won\u2019t allow link)\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20% to an astonishingly low 3.85X price to sales.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)\n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.\n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.\n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA\n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.\n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.\n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.\n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.\n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.\n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.\n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.\n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).\n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews).\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.\n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.

That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nSome headlines since Del Grasso wrote \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d:\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d (Paysafe is market leader in Canada)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares).\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nEssentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in:\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\\\\\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30%\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay\n* Aug 22 \u2014 Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collections of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

Popular analyst Steve Grasso has been calling for it to triple.\n\nUsing the lower end of Paysafe\u2019s forecasted EBITDA ($500M), $1.5B revenue, an EV adjusted for $1.8B debt, and applying the post-merger pro forma 720M outstanding shares, here are Paysafe\u2019s potential share prices based solely on sector peer **EV/EBITDA ratios:**\n\n\u2043 PayPal : $269B EV/ $4.47B EBITDA\n\n    \t= 60.2x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $28.2B EV / SP: $39.28    \n\n\u2043 Repay : $2.2B EV/ $30M EBITDA\n\n    \t = 73.3x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $34.8B EV / SP: $48.43    \n\n\u2043 Shift 4 : $7.7B EV/ $90M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 85x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $41B EV / SP: $56.91    \n\n\u2043 Nuvei : $15B EV/ $171M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 87.7x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $42B EV / SP: $58.40    \n\n\u2043 Adyen : $56B EV/ $273M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 205x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $101B EV / SP: $139    \n\n\u2043 Square : $107B EV/ $357M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 299.7x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $148B EV / SP: $205.64    \n\n\u2043 [Bill.com](https://bill.com/) : $13.2B EV/ -$15.6M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 308x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $152B EV / SP: $211.39    \n\n\u2043 Affirm: $21.6B EV/ -$68M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 317x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $156.7B EV /SP: $217.64    \n\nEV/Revenue ratio , non-public company\u2019s with estimated revenue per recent funding rounds:\n\n\u2043 Stripe : $95B EV/ $1.8B est. rev\n\n    \t= 52.8x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $77.3B EV / SP: $107.44    \n\n\u2043 Chime : $30B EV/ $600M est. rev\n\n    \t= 50x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $73.2B EV /SP: $101.67    \n\n\u2043 Checkout : $15B EV/ $100M est. rev\n\n    \t= 150x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $223.2B EV / SP: $310    \n\nNote: Most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s worth this much, but for reference, averaging the above multiples would put BFT/Paysafe\u2019s share price at $135.98\n\nMore realistically, taking the average from the lowest four puts the share price at $50.75.\n\nPaysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming and is used by the top sports gambling company Draftkings. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssential DD on PSFE:\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPartnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.\n\nVoted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n\nPaysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for CTC trading.\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.\n\nUnlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\nIn Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.\n\nRecent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n\nPaysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn\u2019t include planned inorganic M&amp;A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020\u2019s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth.\n\nBuy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it\u2019s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (in Paysafe\u2019s 10-13% range):\n\nPaysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\nValuation Notes:\n\n* Removed all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+\n* Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group\n* Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them\n\nChairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy the DIP",

This valuation was conservative as Paysafe did not have any growth in 2020 due to Covid.   \n\n\n2B of the money was used to pay the debt which means investors got a good deal at $10 with market cap at 7B. Which means either Bill Foley paid 2 billion more or blackstone received 2 billion less. Either way, investors got a 2B discount. Fast forward to now, the market cap is at 6 billion with revised upwards guidance for the year at 1.55b compared to 1.5b, with 23% growth excluding divested business. This is impressive as in just over a year, they grew from 0 growth to 23% growth and increasing their operating income margins from 10+% to over 30%, helping them to their first ever net positive income quarter. \n\nHowever, as we know shorts attacked it just as any SPACS. What separates it from other SPACS was the valuation initially at 9B was already undervalued unlike many clean energy SPACS which has lofty valuation and unrealistic projections. Paysafe was projected base on 0 growth in 2020, and a mere 10% annual growth. \n\nFurthermore, given many recent fintech acquisition such as square acquiring of afterpay is upwards of 20x revenue. FB and Paypal have both indicate they see the digital wallet segment as a game changer, whereby Paysafe is already a established player in the segment for 10 years and is still further growing due to igaming. Microvision being a rumored acquisition for microsoft sustain its p/s ratio at over 800. In comparision, Paysafe p/s ratio is now under 4.\n\nI am sure everyone have see different analysis all putting its target price from 15 upwards to 45.\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n2. Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n3. As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n4. The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\nThis is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2",

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nTLDR: Institutions are currently buying 21x more than selling while it trades near all time low. None of the long list below has been priced in yet.\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal serviceFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new USstates, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants\n* .July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n* Aug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, digital currencies and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) global capital\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20% to an astonishingly low 3.85X price to sales.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d \n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)  \n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. \n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. \n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA \n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. \n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d  \n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d \n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. \n\n \n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. \n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. 1) PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. \n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.  \n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.  \n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. \n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. \n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).  \n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). \n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. \n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d \n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas.

In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% \n* Aug 16 \u2014 Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay \n* Aug 22 \u2014 Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collections of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nTLDR: Institutions are currently buying 21x more than selling while it trades near all time low. None of the long list below has been priced in yet.\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal serviceFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new USstates, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants\n* .July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, digital currencies and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) global capital\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 3, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today, reversing from yesterday\u2019s losses and extending the current run of day-to-day volatility. Like I said yesterday, I expect a lot of choppiness moving forward as the market participants continue to balance record corporate earnings and expectations for economic expansion with concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. Looking ahead, market participants wait for the July Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday.\n\nConcerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida now emerging as the US\u2019 new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. However, it is very important to understand that cases remain highly concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy, among other factors. For example, last week 1 in 3 new COVID infections came from just two states: Texas and Florida, according to the White House. While one always has to understand the risks present in the market, in my humble opinion, I don\u2019t think the Delta variant will weigh too heavily on the US economy as a whole. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* General Motors (GM) said it will be closing three of its North American assembly plants next week due to the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* Shares of Tencent (TCEHY) fell 10% after a state-media called video games \"spiritual opium\". This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. Looks like the regulatory crackdown in China continues\u2026\n* After a disappointing IPO, shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up more than 25% today. Stock is now roughly 27% above it\u2019s IPO price of $38 \n* French pharma giant Sanofi bought Translate Bio, a biotech company focused on using mRNA to develop other vaccines and therapeutics. Paul Hudson, Sanofi CEO, said of the acquisition, \u201cTranslate Bio adds an mRNA technology platform and strong capabilities to our research, further advancing our ability to explore the promise of this technology to develop both best-in-class vaccines and therapeutics.\u201d\n* Yesterday, semiconductor company Micron Technology announced it was starting a $0.10 dividend, a great sign that company operations are strong. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Arista Networks (ANET) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings:  August 16 - premarket\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart.  This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# EPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company.  Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source).  We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS.  For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat.  My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Revenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million.  With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth.  We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source).  That's right in the middle of guidance.  Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate.  That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%.  From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits.  By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Recent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market.  It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day.  It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\]  But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling.  Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\n# Bottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe).\n* July 26 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair &amp; Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe\u2019s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel.\n* July 27 \u2014 Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe\u2019s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership\n* Aug 2 \u2014 Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe\u2019s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n* Aug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# M&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X.  Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return.  He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further:  \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Rounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.  Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets.   It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.   Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11   --)   By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# iGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below).  Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(5)  Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n* \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(4)\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(3)\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# MOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Valuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n    \u2022\tEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n    \u2022\tEV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options.  I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions.  Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "All year for about 13 months now I've  been heavy on growth. I've come close to my position nearly doubling in value, and then lost all my profits in February. Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.\n\nI have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.\n\n\nI recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. \n\nI'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. \n\nI sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)\n\nI made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.\n\n\nJust wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.\n\n\nI am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.\n\n\nMy advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.\n\n\nLove to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..\n\nBTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well.

It has been bleeding for months now and hasn't been lower than this since October 2020 before it jumped to .19 and then retraced back .05 and repeated a jump to .32. \n\nMarket cap is  19.608M. Unique Logistics have several customers that are some of the bigger players. \n\n[Carparts.com](https://Carparts.com), AutoZone Inc, HP Inc., and recently hired a new CFO about 4 months ago. \n\nAccording to Yahoo 62.34% is held by insiders, so I would think this is a major bullish sign. \n\nFloat is around 152 Mil, so nothing crazy.\n\nHere is their balance sheet/income statement.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5lnsn10ijsg71.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd2afbd4dd4764ab4b13befa15dbd1ae834a8f21\n\nIt doesn't look too hot, but year over year quarterly earnings didn't disappoint in February. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uafvx0erjsg71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8551986983bf7f74a36b64ebcaded34b135c683\n\nLast time I checked UNQL had earnings released in August last year so I'd expect it soon probably within a month or so.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.\n\n# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep \u2018taper talk\u2019 going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n*****\n&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed chairman\u2019s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. \u201cI don\u2019t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don\u2019t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed and markets\nBut the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed\u2019s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for Powell, \u201che\u2019s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he\u2019s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there\u2019s a lot of it,\u201d said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.\n*****\n&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There\u2019s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,\u201d said Swonk. \u201cThey want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they\u2019re not hitting the brakes. They\u2019re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cIf this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we\u2019re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they\u2019re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sxTwppT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/XaZ3OqE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oLHqqFQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iuH4ig1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lflLJO1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7JLtvgO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cnmvI5A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cqw6DkJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QeyCpqJ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4izjE1a.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/k1m7sYO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year\n\n&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In post-election years, September\u2019s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out\n\n&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims\n\n&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Share.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss\n\n&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**\n\n&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 20th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.22.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$JD $CRM $BBY $PTON $SNOW $XPEV $DKS $PDD $MDT $ANF $AAP $DG $EXPR $MRVL $ULTA $PANW $ITRN $DLTR $INTU $MSGE $MARK $COTY $WDAY $JWN $SPLK $CTRN $BURL $GPS $ADSK $MOMO $FLWS $BMO $URBN $BOX $SAFM $HPQ $HTHT $WSM $TOL $TD $BNS $DELL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YupEtZ9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/bge25NW.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eKNfaOS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Nsf4OKr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  8.24.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xfr0NjU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Ly7VHw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OFpxuOX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8uM0FGq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/drMyySB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7Hr5nKX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLkiAvx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JD.com, Inc. $63.62\n**JD.com, Inc.

Converting Silica (Quartz, SiO2) into high purity silicon using PUREVAP\u2122 QRR,\n2. Converting Silicon (Si) into Nano Silicon powders using PUREVAP\u2122 NSIR. The goal is to increase performance and storage capacity (highly sought-after characteristics in many industries but specifically EV) in lithium-ion batteries by replacing graphite with these nano silicon powders, and\n3. Converting Silica (Quartz, SiO2) quartz into fumed silica.  \n\n\nThe successful milestone announced today by HPQ relates to the conversion of silicon into Nano Silicon powders (project #2 above). After experiencing certain delays relating to unexpected operating issues, PyroGenesis\u2019 engineering team has been able to successfully produce nano silicon materials, and this represents a significant confirmation of the original assumptions underlying this project.\n\nThe next major milestone is to optimize the process and have a third-party evaluation of powder characteristics, after which orders can be delivered to various entities who have been waiting to receive samples.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding certain unexpected operating challenges, the results today are indeed a significant milestone as it validates our original assumptions and provides further evidence that we are on the right path,\u201d said P. Peter Pascali, CEO and Chair of PyroGenesis. \u201cAlthough there may be challenges ahead, and no outcome can be guaranteed, words cannot adequality describe the excitement at PyroGenesis of potentially being able to address significant challenges facing the development of lithium-ion batteries for the EV market, and others. For example, by 2030, it is estimated that anodes may contain up to 30% silicon in automotive applications as compared to today where silicon is barely used in these applications.2\u201d\n\n[Research](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TDv-uxAOqfiOsWrObsZOP4ecEC0KhHAuWShfW8LoF6OGNC72EFL-U1jdYCwr9m_gSCn-npJRqaAUrIzCPCJXKppKX41LtLh9HkDYKAG2MIBVcb8djwV-HNRJ-DjS6oc_flyVgDDL_ABMkyEt13WYy89Var4UPx8wfdhwP0vCx0c=)3 indicates that replacing graphite with nano silicon powders could allow for the manufacturing of high-performance Li-ion batteries with the capability of delivering an almost tenfold (10x) increase in anode capacity, inducing a 20-40% gain in the energy density of the next generation of Li-Ion batteries. The Li-ion battery market size is estimated to grow from USD 44.2 billion in 2020 to USD 94.4 billion by 2025, equivalent to a CAGR of 16.4%.4 \n\nPyroGenesis also confirms that it is now moving forward with the next phase of the project which consists (i) designing and manufacturing a semi-continuous process system with a commercial production capacity of at least 500 kg/month (approx. 6 MT/year) of nano silicon powders, and (ii) validating commercial scalability.\n\n\u201cPyroGenesis\u2019 last major milestone, prior to the delivery of its first nano silicon sample, is the completion of an optimization process on the samples produced\u201d, said Mr. Pierre Carabin, CTO and Chief Strategist of PyroGenesis. \u201cThe optimization process will, amongst other things, (i) improve product quality and consistency, (ii) evaluate the chemical characteristics, and (iii) perform microscopic and particle size distribution analysis.\u201d\n\nAs previously disclosed, PyroGenesis has entered into an agreement with HPQ NANO in which, amongst other things, PyroGenesis benefits from (i) a 10% royalty (\u201cRoyalty\u201d) on HPQ NANO\u2019s future sales (with set minimums), and (ii) the option to convert this Royalty at any time into a 50% ownership in HPQ NANO.\n\n**About PyroGenesis Canada** **Inc.**\n\nPyroGenesis Canada Inc., a high-tech company, is a leader in the design, development, manufacture and commercialization of advanced plasma processes and sustainable solutions which reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) and are economically attractive alternatives to conventional \u201cdirty\u201d processes. PyroGenesis has created proprietary, patented and advanced plasma technologies that are being vetted and adopted by multiple multibillion dollar industry leaders in four massive markets: iron ore pelletization, aluminum, waste management, and additive manufacturing.

        "selftext": " \n\nI've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a \"pre-squeeze\" movement, there is likely far more to come.\n4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.\n5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13% with the same elevated cost to borrow.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO &amp; $GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nBe warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\n**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put\u2026**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a \u201cBlack swan event\u201dby purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars\u2026Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I\u2019m saying that maybe it\u2019s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don\u2019t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m\u2026 another bearish catalyst for the market\u2026 I literally could go on and on guys\u2026. It\u2019s pretty obvious at this point\u2026we\u2019ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December. \n\nEdit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit\u2026",

        "selftext": "Elon Musk told employees that he agrees with Ark Invest that Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share \u201cif they execute really well.\u201d The CEO has often commented on Tesla\u2019s stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. \n\nIn 2020, when Tesla\u2019s stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was \u201ctoo high\u201d. It sent Tesla\u2019s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.\n\nWall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.\n\nThis week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: \u201cOur estimate for Tesla\u2019s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,\u201d In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That\u2019s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.\n\nIn an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark\u2019s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: \u201cIf we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.\u201d A $3,000 share price would put Tesla\u2019s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. \n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nSince Ark\u2019s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk\u2019s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla\u2019s stock price. He believes that \u201cif executed really well\u201d, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/)",

I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.\n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high. I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices. Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\nThis was yesterday, Friday, September 3. \n\n$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!??

Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!! \n\nFor fucks sake people, THIS IS HUGE!! This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to read\u2026 I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. I\u2019m actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally read\u2026I wish I was joking. Whatever\u2026weird. \n\nGross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026\n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\nSo investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nThe lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\nThey reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you. \n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\nLet me be clear\u2026I personally don\u2019t believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I don\u2019t want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do I\u2019ll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. \n\nSince the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\nShort term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\nLong term: \n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS. You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\nMy last position:\n\n$2,500 in Cash.\n\nSimply put\u2026cash is a position. People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. Timing this is almost impossible\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!",

        "selftext": "I have been avidly learning the great minds of WallStreetBets and have gained extensive knowledge on investing, risk management, and portfolio growth. WSB has introduced me to the great world of options, and it has completely changed my life. \n\n**Pre-WSB**\nI am ashamed to admit\u2026 but I used to be a\u2026 *Boglehead*. In my early investing days (~5 months ago) the dinosaur Vanguard lentil eaters told me it is *impossible* to beat the market. They all accepted an early defeat that they\u2019ll never be rich, so they default to 6% yearly returns and averaging into the occasional 40% crash. Rather than risking my money on something *totally risky* like Apple (which holds $300B+ in cash and literally only goes up), I should own Apple and 5000 other companies that nobody knows or cares about.\n\nUnfortunately, these boomers convinced me and I threw my entire portfolio into VT and BND. \u201cOwn the market and you will get rich\u2026. when you\u2019re 500 years old\u201d. After holding for 2 weeks and losing 1.3%, I sold all my shares and started a new adventure. \n\n\n**Learning from WSB**\nAs I came to WSB, I saw a skilled trader lose $100k in seconds. His life: destroyed. In the next post, I saw another investor make $100k in seconds. His life: changed! I was in awe. The Bogleheads made me lose 1.2% of my account and told me to \u201chold for the next 60 years\u201d. Meanwhile I saw someone make 10,000% in a few minutes on some SPY calls. So I did what any logical person would do and opened a Robinhood account. I promptly applied for options, and Vlad personally gave me approval. He told me that life in Bulgaria was very difficult, but through options he was able to get out of the poor eurozone and into the United States. \n\nMy first trade was a massive success. I made 20% on an SPY call. I made 3 years worth of the Bogleheads dream in minutes. These losers can\u2019t compete. In the subsequent few months, I have 100x my account. Through a series of 0-1 DTE SPY calls, I have found great success trading complex financial derivatives that I do not understand. It\u2019s amazing. My life has been changed and I cannot thank WSB enough. \n\n\n**THANK YOU**\nI would like to thank WSB for fundamentally changing my life. Not only have you made me 100x richer, but you have taught me the importance of risk taking. I would still be a Vanguard boglehead loser if I didn\u2019t discover the power of 0-1DTE SPY calls (I do not buy puts since they\u2019re anti-American \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaa). If WSB was not filled with such intellectuals, I would have not trusted the numerous great DDs.\n\nThis leads me to my question:\n**Why doesn\u2019t everyone trade options?**\nI don\u2019t think it makes sense to buy and hold something for DECADES and hope for a 100% return after 20 years. I have made 100x in 3 months and could not imagine how pathetic I would look still holding VT and BND. I have leveraged all my accounts through a series of all in trades. I now have a Tesla arriving soon all thanks to the YOLO and WSB. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t everyone do this?! It seems like free money.",

        "selftext": "Uranium.\n\nSure, there are no flashing LEDs like CRSR adds to all of their products, but that\u2019s because we don\u2019t need it. Uranium already glows in the dark! (No, radioactive things don\u2019t really glow in the dark. You have to mix trace radioactive material with a fluor to do that.)\n\nMaybe Uranium isn't as sexy as some over-hyped under-developed threadmill with an iPad glued to it that kills babies, and it is lacking in buzzwords like \"cloud data analytics,\" but uranium is energy. And everything we do takes energy, and this is the cleanest, densest, most likely candidate for the immediate future. There are already big incumbents in energy that need to get shouldered aside, so this will be a slower play than the up 50% in a week flavors of the month (which then fall 90%), but this is the real deal. With calls you can still get that 50%, or 500%, but shares will take some time. That said, many of these names are up 15% in a week, just barely OTM calls up 500%. That's not exactly [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\nUranium has a serious bull case of ahead of it. A new fund is in town (Sprott) who is buying up all the physical uranium. Get ready to gap up. Yes you have heard some of this before, and I peddled Uranium a full on year ago, but this fund is a market mover and it changes everything.\n\nSorry if you saw this quickly deleted multiple times. F'ing automod.\n\nTLDR, 1) since 2019 supply has been below demand for uranium as the market continues to deal with a supply overhang and over-investment by miners from the previous market cycle. COVID then reduced supply by a further 30% through mine closures that have continued for 2021 and the supply overhang is finally gone. 2) More nuclear reactors are being built worldwide than decommissioned, developing nations have hopped on board the nuclear train, and 3) if any country is serious about getting to carbon neutral then the only realistic avenue is via massive expansion of the nuclear fleet. Lastly, 4) there is a new physical trust (Sprott) busy buying up all of the uranium and driving up the spot price. It\u2019s working.\n\nUranium spot is $34.60 right now, 2007 was $137. That\u2019s a lot of upside baby. Oh, and did I mention that the Uranium market is small? Tiny. Super tiny. WSB could blow this thing up. There isn\u2019t an entire industry of traders, hedgers, and dilatants (that\u2019s a nice way of saying degenerates) trading U like there are for oil or other commodities.\n\n**1. The Setup**: Uranium is already on a 5 year trend line of tendies\n\nUranium has been in a bear market since 2007. It started to finally sell through the over supply and over investment of the last market cycle and has been climbing from its low of $18.50 in 2016. This was already a 4 year trend line, and then COVID came along.\n\nCOVID changed the uranium market in two main ways. First, it dramatically reduced global supply by about 30% in 2020 and 2021 due to mine closures by many of the majors and juniors. These closures have allowed the sticky overhang from the last decade to finally get put on the spot market. Second, there appears to be an OPEC+ of uranium forming. Miners, no doubt still traumatized from last time they aggressively expanded productions, are not opening new minds even as spot prices surge. Instead, they continue to provide quarterly guidance that they are operating below capacity for the rest of the year, and are selling old supply instead of starting new mines. They aren\u2019t formally a cartel like OPEC is, but there seems to be some game theory going on here. It is miner\u2019s best interest to try to exactly match the demand of U on a global scale and then be able to dictate the price. Since fuel costs are just 2% of the operating costs of a nuclear reactor, utilities can also stomach significant increases in spot prices without effecting their generation rates of \\~ $.02/KwH.\n\nU is $34.60 right now which is 75.24% below its peak in 2007. In a market with all-time highs all over the place, U has a long way to run. What will miner prices be if U hits $100+ again? Massive.\n\n**2. New Demand**: Global demand has outpaced supply\n\nPlanned Reactor Starts in Gross MWe of new capacity (from world-nuclear.org)\n\n* 2021: 5,711\n* 2022: 13,559\n* 2023: 13,276\n* 2024: 7,569\n* 2025: 5,112\n* 2026: 6,997\n* 2027: 4,100\n\nCredit Suisse offers their own global view of supply &amp; demand here. Get your sunglasses on as this assumes the US fleet is shrinking into 2030. That likely won\u2019t be the case. See comments #1, automod doesn't like my links.\n\nFirst, if you are from the US then you are likely biased against nuclear. Get over it. The US has a very old fleet and has been periodically retiring plants rather than performing maintenance. I\u2019ll get back to the US later, but the global view is very, very positive. Globally, many developing nations are starting to add, or start, a nuclear fleet. It\u2019s cheap and it doesn\u2019t pollute. India, Slovakia, Belarus, and Pakistan all have new plants started or starting in the next year. France continues to expand and sell energy, while China seems serious about cutting CO2 emissions and is massively expanding their existing fleet, as well as breaking ground on the world\u2019s first SMR earlier this year.\n\nSo back to the USA\u2014the US mostly acts as a drag. A reactor in New York just closed, and others throughout the country are always wavering on edge of retirement. This is set to change, but it depends upon politics, so we\u2019ll see (and the right likes nuclear too, it\u2019s not just about CO2). The Secretary of Energy is committed to keeping every single US plant operating as it prepares to transition to a fleet of fast breeding, small modular reactors (SMR\u2019s) in the \u201clate 2020s, early 2030s.\u201d (this just means highly fuel efficient with far, far less waste, and reactors the size of a 3-4 story apartment building instead of a city block. Each will power 500,000+ homes, so they can be \u201cclose\u201d to cities they power and also reduce infrastructure costs.) She is working with legislatures to allow all currently operating plants to essentially receive carbon credits as an incentive for utilities to keep the plants running and well maintained until the SMR roll-out.\n\nYes, this is a long horizon for the US, but the US is only one part of the uranium market and a very minor part of this bull case. Globally, supply/demand are already tight, and the world fleet is slated to expand. Utilities can see the writing on the wall and will want to start placing orders now for future delivery (spot market for Uranium is quite different from other commodities\u2014purchasing, delivery, enrichment, and feeding take years. You can bet these utilities are looking at supply/demand graphs and already panicking. Spot is going to start gapping up instead of ticking.\n\n**3. Green Energy**: The Elephant in the Room\n\nNuclear power is the greenest mass-scalable energy on the planet. Hydro destroys entire riparian ecosystems, wind and solar are both CO2 heavy in terms of manufacturing and are slow ROI on the carbon expenditure as well as having short functional commercial lifespans, while geothermal is quite literally tied to very specific locations (OK, I don\u2019t know anything about tidal, but other than reading about some plans being nixed by NIBY Boomers I\u2019m not seeing it either).\n\nThese renewable forms of power generation have another cost: land. Aside from geothermal, these are not power dense generators. Here is an article working through the cost in land to electrify just British Colombia\u2019s transport grid. The takeaway is that nuclear wins by a landslide: 2.4 m2/kWh versus solar\u2019s 36.9m2, hydro\u2019s 54 m2, and wind\u2019s 72.1 m2. If you want to electrify the US transport grid then you can either build some nuclear plants, or convert all of Nevada to a giant solar farm. I mean, what is Nevada good for anyway?\n\nNumbers on energy density coming from here: damn you automods, see comments for links.\n\nThe latest generation of nuclear plants, SMRs, are small and safe. They can be built alongside cities to save CO2 and money that would otherwise go into infrastructure. How many more fires are we going to see every fire season as PG&amp;E and other utilities run millions of miles of hot lines all over the country? This too is a cost of the current way to locating and distributing energy. This all changes with SMRs, and all for the better.\n\nBiden has made some surprisingly strong claims about aiming the US at net zero, and we\u2019re hardly a climate activist country. If this happens in other countries, and perhaps the US, then it means we are looking at hundreds upon hundreds of new nuclear power plants in the next two decades, not just the few dozen currently in the planning stages over the coming 2020s. This will be the renaissance of nuclear, and it is coming.\n\nThink about it. If there is any chance in hell of reducing carbon emissions, then nuclear is the path forward. Everything else is a half measure.\n\n**4. The Dinosaur in the Room**: Sprott Physical Uranium Trust\n\nThis is a new fund from an old hand in physical trusts. Sprott\u2019s Physical Uranium Trust (U.U \u2013 Canadian listed, NYSE coming in \\~4m) purchases uranium on the spot market and then warehouses it. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole plan. This is gigantic.\n\nAs shares of U.U are issued Sprott takes that money and buys uranium, which increases their NAV. So long as they have a premium to NAV they keep buying. They\u2019ve only been buying physical uranium for two weeks now, but **they\u2019ve already purchased 13.3% of the estimated global uranium production for all of 2021**. Read that sentence again. 20.59m lbs of the projected world supply of 154m lbs. Jesus Christ are these guys a market force to be reckoned with. How is this not illegal?\n\nLook at spot price versus their holdings. They march up and up in tandem. Spot has gone up 7.1% in the last month, with all of those gains coming within days of when Sprott started buying.\n\nSee comment link for google spreadsheet of Sprott and spot rate.\n\n**5. There are short sellers here**\n\nSome entities sell naked uranium deliveries. In a market as slow moving and opaque as uranium is this probably seemed like a good idea at the time. How much of a factor would this be? I don't honestly know. Uranium is not like other commodities with all their nifty reporting and data. We'll find out?\n\n**Positions or Ban:** OK, we know you all just skipped to the end anyway\n\nGo long anything uranium.\n\nMiners/Exploration:\n\n* CCJ\n* NXE\n* Google as many are too small by marketcap for me to list here, but they are mostly small for a reason\n* U.U (This is Sprott. Buy this, but only if Canadian. Imagine what will happen when this gets NYSE listed in 2022!)\n\nURA: ETF of major and minor miners, equipment production, all things uranium\n\n*Options*:\n\nAs we all know, there are only a few times when dealers work with your play instead of hedging against it, and one of those is when you buy far OTM calls. When you buy a far OTM call the dealer will also purchase or adjust their position matching your direction.\n\nSo, if you are buying calls (I would recommend calls *and* shares) then far OTM calls skew delta in our favor.\n\nThat out of the way, the Uranium market is slow, but Sprotts has started to speed things up.\n\nURA 10/22 $25c is about as high as I would go without going longer dated.\n\nAfter that, June 2022 $30+ is cheapish. No doubt you will all ignore this and buy something idiotic like front month $30. Really, don\u2019t do that.\n\nNXE 2/22 or 12/22 $5 or $7. I did a few call debit spreads of buying 12/22 $5, selling $7. Probably should be greedier, but it seems so safe. What could go wrong?\n\n*Shares*:\n\nI like NXE from the miners/explorers the most, but CCJ is also a very solid miner. Google smaller marketcap ones on your own.\n\nMy positions:\n\n* URA &amp; NXE shares (some other too small of marketcap to list)\n* URA 10/22 $25c\n* URA 6/22 $28c &amp; 30c\n* NXE 9/17 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $7c",

Other companies that have made similar announcements include Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), which also pledged 100 billion yuan, and Geely Automobile (0175.HK). read more\n\nThe government-backed Zhejiang News website said Alibaba's funds will go towards areas such as subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises and improving insurance protection for gig economy workers such as couriers and ride-hailing drivers.\n\nIt will also set up a 20 billion yuan \"common prosperity development fund\", the newspaper said, with Alibaba confirming the report.\n\nThe e-commerce giant and its tech rivals have been the target of a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on issues ranging from monopolistic behaviour to consumer rights. Alibaba was fined a record $2.75 billion in April over monopoly violations.",

        "selftext": "The Tesla Cybertruck delay was already a known fact, but CEO Elon Musk's latest reported comments add a few more details to the picture. Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\n\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\n\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/)\n\nElon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that\u2019s only going to happen with a big \u201cif.\u201d  \nThe new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.   \nWhen first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.\n\nTesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  \nPeople who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  \nThe vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn\u2019t a priority for Tesla.  When asked about the Roadster\u2019s timeline today, Musk confirmed that it is now delayed to 2023.  \n \n\nLink: [https://electrek.co/2021/09/01/tesla-delays-new-roadster-2023/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/01/tesla-delays-new-roadster-2023/)",

        "selftext": "TMC (The Metals Company) is a recent \"de-SPA C\" that started trading on Friday.  It's a deep sea mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9-9.50 range).\n\nThe key thing here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million PIPE shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).\n\nOkay, so why do we care? Here's why this is potentially one of the most explosive stocks we've ever seen this week:\n\nThe current float is 2.72 million because 91% of the original 30 million shares redeemed for cash.\n\nThe short interest is around 1.77 million shares (or roughly 65% of the current float is short).\n\nBut here's the \"canary in the coal mine\": the open interest.  Market makers were selling calls based on the prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've potentially sold much more than the entire current float:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/823tys3ci9n71.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=493a7a66e8ffbe60cf7c4ae599e422c9b9779f09\n\nThere's 25k calls for 9/17 between $10 and $12.50.  That's 2.5 million shares.  There's another 8.2k calls for 9/17 between $14 and $15.  That's another 820k shares.\n\n**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls.**  **If it's over $15 by Friday, MMs will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**\n\nThat's just September.  Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...\n\n**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls.**\n\n(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).\n\nI'm gonna be honest, I have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SP ACs recently is unprecedented).  MMs have to keep this pinned under $10 by Friday or all hell will break loose.\n\nEasiest way/lowest risk way to play this is just buy stock (which should go up 200-300% in a \"gamma + short squeeze\" scenario).  September calls are super risky but will pay off in 5/10/15 baggers if the stock actually gets past $15 and rockets.\n\nOctober calls are lower risk than September but should still turn in 4/6/8 baggers if it gets past $15.\n\nPositions: 1000 shares of stock. 250 $12.50 calls, 200 $15 calls for Sept.  \n\nAs always do your own DD, I think this is the most explosive setup ever, but it may just stay pinned under $10 and then the calls are worthless.  Good luck.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post. Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.\n\nWe all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called \u201cPlays\u201d this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!\n\nPlease try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:\n\nMy 5 as a Day Trader:\n\nRKT \u2013 This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar\n\nUWMC \u2013 This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents\n\nTIGR \u2013 This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)\n\nCPNG \u2013 I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)\n\nCRSR \u2013 I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)\n\nThese are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore\n\nBILL \u2013 This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100\u2026 I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it\n\nMRNA \u2013 I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100\u2026\n\nSE \u2013 I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus\n\nCMG \u2013 OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 shares\u2026 What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining in the basement????\n\nZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!\n\nI hope this helps others get an idea and thank you everyone.",

        "selftext": "Ever since GMREEEE this sub has been filled with people from r/all calling for the end of payment for order flow for a variety of reasons.  Now the front page has a news article talking about how the SEC chair is thinking about ending payment for order flow.  I just wanted to say that if you're against payment for order flow there's probably a 95 percent chance that you don't know what a call condor spread is.  PFOF gives you no or reduced commissions and also makes the options market more liquid.  Here are some arguments against PFOF that I've seen on this sub:\n\n1. HedGe FuNd GiVe BAd FiL.\n\n       In reality you can set the price for what you want your options to be filled at.  This can be done by making a FUCKING LIMIT ORDER.  There is probably not a single professional option trader that buys or sells options with a market order.  Options are, by their nature, illiquid on a majority of underlyings given that you have thousands of combinations of strikes and dates to choose from.  Again, especially if you trade spreads, you should be placing limit orders for your positions.  Also, if you remove PFOF this liquidity issue will only get worse.  This is just the reality of gutting several billion dollar firms that write and buy options.  Less money in the options market means less liquidity.\n\n2. HooDgE FunD ManiPuLaeT MarkET wItH my OrDeR InForMatIoN\n\n       I can right now go on my think or swim platform and scan for options orders under 10k (or however large you want) and look at the bid/ask spread to tell if this trader bought or sold these options.  If I really wanted to I could go into the API and make a robot that does this for me and organizes all this information into some sort of bullshit spreadsheet.  Small orders like these (the kind retail makes) provide a reasonable guess as to where retail is positioned.  I'm just some jack off wsb troll with a think or swim account and I have already laid how how to detect retail positions.  If I can do it then the big dogs certainly can do the same even without payment for order flow.  \n\n   One more thing: If you lose money on your 10 delta put it's because it was a bad trade, not because some Algo picked out your 5 lot position and spent millions of dollars manipulating the market to shake you out of your 200 dollar position.",

        "selftext": "I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen any explanations on WSB (at least in recent months) about how the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust works, and how it helps to fuel the epic short squeeze going on in Uranium right now.\n\nThe physical trusts offered by Sprott are closed-end funds, meaning that when investors sell the fund, Sprott does not have to go out and also sell Uranium to fund outflows.\n\nIn other words, once uranium hits the Sprott vaults, it might as well be declared retired forever. \n\nThey are structurally diamond handed, which is important for a short squeeze to continue.\n\nSo how does more metal enter the fund?\n\nSprott has filed an \u2018at the money\u2019 share offering where they can issue new shares of the fund any time it trades at a premium to the fund\u2019s net asset value.\n\nEssentially whenever investors get excited and bid up the price of the ETF such that that shares are being bought for more than their underlying value, Sprott will issue new shares, sell them into the market (which helps bring down the premium), and then use this cash to buy more uranium for the fund.\n\nIn the span of a month investors already added enough uranium to the fund to exhaust Sprott\u2019s $300 million offering.\n\nLast week they filed a new offering to increase it from a $300 million program, to a $1,300 million ($1.3 billion) program.\n\nWhile this filing process has been ongoing the past few days, Sprott has not been issuing new shares. So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.\n\nThe premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.\n\nFor perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.\n\nSo 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).\n\nAnd this is a minuscule market, so sprott\u2019s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. \n\nThis of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats \n\nThis is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.\n\nSo what tickers can be offered up here? \n\nNot many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.\n\nOptions? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.\n\n$CCJ is one ticker you\u2019ve likely heard of, and it\u2019s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.  \n\nSprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I\u2019ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can\u2019t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It\u2019s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. \n\nNorthshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker\n\nWant to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they\u2019ve invested in. They also aren\u2019t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.\n\nThis uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what\u2019s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!",

These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.\n\nAnother example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.\n\nInvesting is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** \n\ntrading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.\n\nHere let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. \n\nShit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .\n\nShit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?\n\n**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**\n\nTHis isnt financial advice.

        "selftext": "Cam across this today:\n\nTrading memestonks on your phone is all fun and games -- that is, until you get slapped with an $800k tax bill.\n\nHow? If inexperienced traders run afoul of the \u201cwash sale rule,\u201d taxes could outweigh gains.\n\nA what sale?\nA wash sale is when you sell a security at a loss, then buy it or a [\u201csubstantially identical\u201d](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substantiallyidenticalsecurity.asp) security 30 days before or after the sale.\n\nThe wash sale rule means you can\u2019t take a tax deduction on that loss. It\u2019s to stop people from using wash sales to increase tax benefits, but you can trigger it without even knowing it exists.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nYou buy 100 shares at $10/share for $1k\nLater, you sell them at $7/share for $700 -- a loss of $300\nThe next week, you repurchase them at $6/share for $600\nDue to the wash sale rule, that loss is added to the cost basis, meaning your $600 repurchase becomes $900.\n\nWhen you sell your shares again, your original loss is applied to the adjusted cost basis. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll use on your taxes.\n\nSo, how do you get an $800k tax bill?\nThat example\u2019s an outlier, but the unidentified retail trader told financial advisor Brian Wruk he did it by going berserk on Robinhood, per [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2021/03/26/robinhood-trader-may-face-800000-tax-bill/?sh=4792a11a67c7)\n\nThe man opened a Robinhood account in 2020. He put up $30k, but Robinhood gave him $90k on margin. He then did 10 to 50 trades daily.\n\nHe ultimately:\n\nGenerated $45m (yep, million) in gross proceeds\nProfited by $45k\nHad $1.4m in capital gains tax\nAnd a potential tax bill of $800k+\n\u201cHe booked a profit but was disallowed all the losses because he never once waited the 30 days on those stocks to book the loss,\u201d Wruk said.\n\nAnd short-term gains are taxed like ordinary income. Yikes.\n\nThe moral of the story: Let your stocks marinate at least 30 days, lest you become a cautionary tale!\n\n\nAnother article: https://mullooly.net/800k-taxes-45k-profits/",

        "selftext": "Chewy is an e-commerce retailer of pet food and supplies, mainly active in the USA. Last quarter they posted USD 2.14bn in revenue from 19.8 million customers (600k of which were new additions). For Q2 they project 2.15-2.17 billion in revenue for a very modest 1% q-o-q growth. \n\nI think they'll outdo their (very conservative) revenue guidance, but fall short on customer additions for the quarter and revenue guidance for the following quarters. Chewy is currently trading at the upper end of its historical P/S ratio, (save for a brief time in Jan/Feb 2021 when it was even higher than today). It\u2019s P/S of 4.76 is relatively high for its industry (as it is a low margin retailer, not a platform business). It\u2019s actually higher than Amazon, which I would argue is too high to make sense and I expect a short-term downside re-evaluation of Chewy after earnings.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* **Competition catching up**\n\nThe key investment thesis for Chewy has been \"Fast-growing pet e-commerce industry\" and \"growing faster than its competition in its fast-growing industry\". I believe the second reason may be moderating. While Chewy is the clear market leader, I'm seeing several signs that its competitors (in both e-commerce and retail) are slowly catching up. Walmart (biggest brick and mortal pet retailer) just reported a big revenue beat. Petsmart (brick and mortar focused) is looking to increase revenue this year following a bad 2020. Petco reported great earnings two weeks ago. \n\nThese good results could be because the overall market (\"pet ecommerce\") is expanding. I don't think so. The market expansion took place in 2020, the number of adopted pets is on a clear downtrend. If most other big players are doing quite well, I suspect they are doing so at the expense of Chewy. \n\n* **Low net customers additions**\n\nIn Q1 2021 Chewy added a net 600k customers, their lowest absolute increase in two years. I expect them to report even lower additions this quarter as they follow up Q2 of 2020, their biggest quarter of customer additions ever. 1 year is a very typical \"cliff\" during which many former customers start to churn (according to Chewy CEO Sumit Singh). Since they haven't increased their marketing spend significantly this Q, I expect high churn and low gross additions, which is a bad early sign for growth companies. \n\n[Customer additions per quarter](https://preview.redd.it/dkmcffawmxk71.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5521fbd76802f34cacbc31617550af9f34177b9e)\n\n* **Moderating growth rates in a fast-growth industry**\n\nChewy's app store rankings in Q2 have been at its lowest level since February 2019. Who downloads apps from the store? New customers, usually. Remember the part where I think they will have unexpectedly low gross customer additions this quarter?\n\n[Petco App gaining ground on Chewy](https://preview.redd.it/z5yvwgzjnxk71.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38c746658cf948bc19a514b436ada7ed21cc071a)\n\nPetco is clearly aggressively promoting their app which is currently nearly as popular as Chewy's. You can see how their spikes coincide with drops in Chewy's ranking, leading me to believe that Chewy is losing more business than usual to its competition.\n\n* **Profitability**\n\nWhile profitability is less relevant for Chewy, on Q1 earnings they were relatively sanguine about their expected costs for 2021. Since then I expect hiring, material and logistics costs to have gone up quite a bit, which might result in them offering a more pessimistic profitability guidance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary: Chewy has achieved a high PS ratio thanks to its promise of outgrowing its competitors in a market that is already fast-growing in itself. I believe their competitive advantage is eroding ever so slightly and will result in earnings that Wall Street doesn't like. \n\n**Short interest**\n\nChewy currently has what I would consider a relatively large short interest considering its relatively strong fundamentals. As of August, 16.4% of the short was floated. Make of that what you will. \n\n**Risks**\n\n* A lot of Chewy customers actually use autoship, which may distort the data I'm looking at and allow them to surprise to the upside on revenue\n* I do all my shopping for my pets on Chewy\n\n**Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpekcjdcpxk71.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6c05b0d43d825435b4e3ef664c4ca05d062dd67",

There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**\n\nBEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.\n\nGlobal investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.\n\n\"Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,\" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.\n\nChina is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.\n\nMeanwhile, CSRC will conduct \"pragmatic\" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.\n\nYi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a \"zero-sum game\", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.\n\nGlobal financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, \"rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries\", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.\n\nYi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.\n\nChina will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated \"Panda bonds\" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.\n\nChina will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.\n\nFang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-will-improve-opening-up-capital-market-securities-regulator-2021-09-06/",

        "selftext": "A lot of people said Tesla is an \"AI\" company, not an electric car company from this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney\\_is\\_to\\_netflix\\_as\\_x\\_is\\_to\\_tesla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney_is_to_netflix_as_x_is_to_tesla/)\n\nThe thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nMy thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?\n\n* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few\n* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and [40+ other companies.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/)\n* If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.\n* There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn't a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That's moat. Self-driving doesn't have moat.\n* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.\n* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.\n* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.",

        "selftext": "The IAA has been open for the last 4 days, but I hadn\u2019t been able to properly experience the MicroVision booth until now. I didn\u2019t want to distract Sumit Sharma, Dr. Luce, and the other 3 MVIS staff who attended from their B2B (business to business) goals. However, today was the first day that the general public were allowed to enter the conference halls, and Dave Allen from IR gave us the green light to go visit the booth.\n\nWhen I arrived at the booth with /u/MusicMaleficent5870, Sumit and Dr. Luce were nowhere in sight. We nevertheless decided to go in and speak to the MVIS staff. I personally spoke with Jonathan C (who I believe is the Director of Digital Engineering, thx Linkedin stalking). Jonathan walked me through the booth while MM5870 kept the other two MVIS staff members occupied. I introduced myself as a moderator of reddit and handed him my gag card..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ gag business card ](https://preview.redd.it/2zfx6lvzukm71.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8d919fd1ec5803c6f78d7c5c186b60c299b19b9)\n\n# Live Lidar Demo\n\nAn important note Jonathan mentioned was that two A-Samples were actively scanning the booth. One directly above the live demo screens (that sits on the *in*famous block of wood which I couldn\u2019t see even at a relative far distance), and one directly across from that in the back right hand corner.\n\nThe point of having two Lidars actively scanning is to showcase MicroVision\u2019s proprietary active scan lock architecture which allows the A-Sample to actively block out 99% of outside interference (as communicated to shareholders on multiple occasions in past earnings calls). As per past earnings calls the active scan lock architecture is based on proprietary technologies proven in their applications used in the Hololens 2.\n\nIn short, the Active Scan lock synchronizes the \u201csend\u201d and \u201creceiving\u201d side of the Gen 5 MEMS just as the Hololens 2 displays are sync\u2019d for the left and right eyes to prevent ocular discomfort (Sumit used a word I didn't recognize to describe that if the left eye and right eye images dont line up you get discomfort. I don\u2019t have education or background in this so could barely keep up). Each Lidar sensor is encoded its own laser signals and excludes interference even from similar identical units.\n\nFor example that if you were stuck in an intersection with 20 cars, each with their own set of short-range lidar (SRL), mid-range lidar (MRL), and long-range lidar (LRL). The IR light pollution and interference will overwhelm other sensors that do not have this feature that MicroVision owns IP for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ The second A-Sample live scanning acting as \\\\\"interference\\\\\" above the television which is showing the 1.8M Long Range Point Cloud. ](https://preview.redd.it/ien6mkf1vkm71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cb12842300f04b56ebe7c9fd7577c29351b7307)\n\nIt was explained to me that there is a filter on the live lidar demo. The filter removes the reflection of the floor for aesthetic reasons. They said that if they kept the floor in the final image, you would have been overwhelmed by extra data, but by removing them, the live stream data can be more easily interpreted. Additionally, there are indoor Class 1 EU regs that I believe are in play which made MVIS sandbag their sensor a bit (if anyone was noticing it isn\u2019t as sharp). Sumit says once all testing and certification is done there shouldn\u2019t be any issues seen specifically in the demo booth unit.\n\nThis is also a phenomenon you will notice in future Lidar demos, because the lidar sensor acts similar to the human eye does when it sees a mirage. There is a critical angle after which, the light seems to bounce to infinity. Therefore, the sensor will not return images of the road surface (due to it being a planar surface). All content which is 3 dimensional continues to be detected until the full range as advertised.\n\n# Elvis has Entered the Booth\n\nDuring the middle of conversation with Jonathan, I noticed Sumit and Dr Luce exiting from a meeting room behind the booth with an unidentified gentleman. They had obviously finished a meeting, and one of the helpers came out to return the A-Sample and the Gen 5 mems mirror back into the display (they were not there when we arrived).\n\nSumit walked over, I introduced myself as \u201cJay\u201d and he replied \u201cJay, nice to finally meet you, I\u2019ve been waiting for you all day!\u201d We arrived approximately 45 minutes before closing and I had been with Jonathan for approximately 15 minutes. Additionally, I had told Dave Allen I\u2019d try to swing by later in the afternoon, so I expect Sumit knew we were coming to visit eventually.\n\nSumit then whisked /u/MusicMaleficent5870 and I away toward the live lidar demo to start our proper tour.\n\n# The MicroVision A-Sample\n\nSumit asked us what our backgrounds were to get a grasp of our level of technical knowledge. Suffice it to say, we communicated that it was low lol. One of the biggest things Sumit wanted us to walk away with was the story he was trying to convey to investors. The specific story for investors to recognizing the true value of MicroVision\u2019s IP. The other story he\u2019s trying to convey is the inevitability for customers (from my interpretation of his explanation).\n\nTo give you an example, he spoke briefly about the Hololens 2 and Microsoft. Microsoft spent *years* trying to improve the display of the Hololens 2. It got to the point where they finally realized Microsoft could not achieve it alone (even with a group of ex-MVIS engineers on their engineer team \u2013 this is my addition for color). Alex Kipman himself mentions this in one of his talks in Zurich/digital streams in 2020. Microsoft eventually had to approach MicroVision to get the job done because of MicroVision\u2019s proprietary technology that they\u2019ve built in the past couple of decades. He also believes that **they would have never won that $22 Billion Dollar contract without them** (which I agree with. The Hololens 1 was head-to-head with Magic Leap which ate the dust after the Hololens 2 was released).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Microsoft's \\\\\"$22 Billion Dollar Contract\\\\\" ](https://preview.redd.it/5s1r48a5vkm71.jpg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdaec6c00acd3bc87406771b920045079ea5bb43)\n\nThis story of inevitability is what customers are starting to realize. If you want the best technology that solves your problems rather than creating further problems, you need to use MicroVision technology and IP (their family jewels). Their custom ASICs (which is available in a digital form) is one of the biggest advantages over competitors in the L2 and L2++ field like Tesla and Mobileye with their Camera only Neural Networks.\n\nSumit started to go down the rabbit hole into how Neural Networks work. He wouldn\u2019t trust the safety of that technology with his family, and that we wouldn\u2019t either if we read the disclaimers and fine print for cars who use these systems. This also aligns with Mobileye\u2019s current plan in developing a secondary independent Radar + Lidar system to ensure there are true redundant safety systems for maximum passenger safety.\n\nThere is a joke Sumit likes to share from the Silicon Valley Episode \u201cHot Dog, Not Hot Dog\u201d which helped us understand where he was coming from about Neural Networks.\n\n# The Family Jewels\n\nSumit believes that the ADAS market is going to go \u201cgangbusters\u201d sooner rather than later. See the bidding war currently happening between Magna and Qualcomm over Veoneer (who IAA placed side by side in the conference with Veoneer squished in the middle).\n\nMicroVision has a lot of key advantages with their proprietary custom ASICs. The way Sumit explained it to us was it comes down to basic math and physics. They can do things with edge computing faster and quicker than anyone else with their Family Jewels. **It comes from their custom OS that is built in their chips.** While Microvision is building their ADAS Lidar Sensors from an established foundation and decade\u2019s worth of tech and IP, their friends Luminar are spending billions just to be able to do the same thing with no guarantee that they can do it better or quicker than how MVIS is doing it.\n\nLastly, one of the key praises that potential customers have been commenting on the A-Sample is how **slim in profile the A-Sample is** (Apologies for the photo, I should probably take it lower down).\n\n[ Cassette of Truth - Kanye West's \\\\\"Yeezus\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/278gj577vkm71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54eaf8c77f33d8cd7b98b594a74dc47ce23bad25)\n\n[ MicroVision A-Sample ](https://preview.redd.it/trskb249vkm71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de0bfd1d8dacce0f34aada825dab45be30581c7f)\n\nI plan to publish an album of photos sometime this week which compares the other lidars on display with MVIS\u2019 A-Sample using the \u201ccassette of truth\u201d which I have been photographing to give an idea of the size of all the Lidar sensors. From my observation, MVIS is best in class from a profile aspect, all other lidar sensors are much taller in comparison.\n\n# The Lidar Product Suite\n\nSumit Sharma wants to generate more revenue. While the Hololens 2 currently does not produce enough volume for the time being,  **he believes that will change soon** with the new Lidar Product family.\n\nSumit also shared that they were getting a lot of requests for small NREs (non-recurring engineering) about, \u201chey we already have a product for short-range Lidar for the time being, can you make something for mid-range only, or maybe long-range only?\u201d.  There was enough interest that it made sense for MicroVision perspective to produce the A-Sample which would be identical to their Dynamic View Lidar (DVL) hardware wise, but with limited features the customer require now to help generate that revenue.\n\nTheir Dynamic View Lidar is meant to be their premium/flagship lidar offering. Sumit also touched on the use case of the 905nm lasers which have a standard and secure supply chain unlike the 1550nm lasers which are either custom made or non-standard supply chains utilizing exotic materials (which Velodyne does a great job of explaining in this article: [https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/](https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/)).\n\nNot only do the lasers help MVIS scale, but with the launch of MicroVision\u2019s fifth-generation MEMS to a 200-millimeter wafer silicon they control the whole process. They own their IP, and nobody else does. This gives them the ability to manufacture it the way they want. More control for MicroVision means more stability for customers.\n\n# True Value\n\nI was honestly surprised how in tune Sumit was to investors. He is also very aware of trader activity, but that is out of his hands. He\u2019s here to get true value for MVIS long investors and the multiplier/upside is massive in his eyes.\n\nI came away from the 30minute discussion in awe to be honest. There was so much content packed into that meeting, and Sumit was exuding nothing but confidence. If there are any German investors in Munich, make sure you go visit the booth, it\u2019s an excellent opportunity to share in the excitement and bullishness Sumit is currently feeling.\n\nGLTALs, it's 3:30am and i'm going to bed.\n\nTLDR - bullish",

        "selftext": "Hello retards,\n\nI've been watching $GME like a hawk all week and the correlation between volume and price for the past week is incredible and to me seems very, very bullish. Check it out:\n\nAugust 26th at open: Spikes on high volume (889k shares in first hour, goes up $10). It waffles for a bit  as volume declines and hits its daily peak at $217 on 851k shares. Volume drops like a rock for the rest of the day and it sinks back down to $203.80 at close.\n\nAugust 27th: Jumps from $207 to $213 at open, volume goes down then back up over the course of the day and the price kinda waffles. This one doesn't follow the trend so well. The next day does, however\n\nAugust 30th: Jumps from $206 to $215 in the first hour on high volume (547k shares). Volume declines for the rest of the day and it drops again\n\nAugust 31st: Jumps about $6 in the first 2 hours on high volume (315k first hour, 729k second).\n\nSept 1st (Today): Jumps to hit its weekly peak of $231 at open on its **highest one-hour volume all week**, with 1.09M shares traded in the first hour. It then spends the rest of the day tanking on decreasing volume.\n\nIs it just me or does this seem incredibly bullish? It seems if we had a sustained high volume event we could see this stock rocket. Fortunately we probably do, as Sept 6-8th are the 3 days before earnings. Once this thing hits WSB and news outlets consistently we could easily be riding the rocket. Also because you're all brain damaged, this isn't financial advice.\n\n[crayon lines &amp; arrows for our special readers](https://preview.redd.it/9y9o5d5sgzk71.png?width=1913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7912e178518b335e0a07490fce23d79aaf7a63cf)\n\nAs a side note: comparing this to $AMC is pretty funny. It literally tanks on some of its recent volume spikes. Biggest P&amp;D of this week and stands no chance to keep going up.\n\nPositions: 3x $GME 10/15 690c @ 2.90(?) cost basis, probably buying one last one tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "Everything here is not financial advice. I just want to know if someone can do it better.\n\n**Prediction:**\n\nPersonally, I'm banking on a quick crash of 30%-40% of the overall market followed by a lengthy recovery time.\n\nWith the public consciousness being aware of the rapid inflation, the Great Resignation, the ending of the eviction moratorium, rising tensions within and out of the country, scrambled supply lines accompanied with mass shortages, and blah-blah-blah, I think a lot of investors have their fingers hovering over the sell button. This, along with the addition of short sellers ready to dogpile on the beginning of a downward trend, should result in a sharp decline in several securities' prices. However, unlike the Covid-19 crash, I do not believe we'll experience a quick bull rally after the market bottoms out.\n\nThe flash crash of 2020 was driven by the fear of an unknown virus and the suspicion of an overdue recession, but once heavy government intervention was in place, investors had their confidence restored. This time around, the U.S. is facing a likely default on it's debt and dealing with almost irreparable internal economic problems, and the general confidence in our institutions has greatly withered since then. I think America's government is very limited with how it can intervene and I have trouble seeing the market whales and many retail traders easily jumping right back in after any announcement has been made; leading to a prolonged stagnation.\n\nNow, I am certainly not a professional in market predictions or knowing what the hell the powers that be can do alter markets. I'm just someone who likes trading and has been keeping up with the news. You should take this prediction with a FISTFUL of salt.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nSadly, my broker restricts much of what I can do (no naked options, no covered puts, no margin account for options, etc.), which restricts how much I can grow my account. Nevertheless, I worked a way around these rules and plan for a FAT gain.\n\nWith that said, I want to combine my money with borrowed cash from friends/family (people who are outside the market) and a personal loan, plus whatever my brokerage will give me in my margin account. Estimated leverage should be roughly x3.5. After gathering the capital, I will short the ever-loving shit out of SPXL (a 3x leverage ETF of the SP500) and use the new founded cash along with some of the account's original capital to buy ATM puts. Next, using a majority of the remaining capital, I'll buy shares of SPXS (a 3x leverage inverse ETF of the SP500) and sell deep OTM calls because of the increased volatility due to panic selling. What's left of the account will be spent on ATM calls of SPXS.\n\nI chose SPXL and SPXS for the fact they follow the very stable and predictable SP500, but with more bang for their buck. I know WSB isn't known for it's safer gambles, but with the increased risk of using so much borrowed money and a falling market, I needed something to sound somewhat safe and reasonable to place the bet.\n\nIf this portion of the plan fails, all I have to simply do is consolidate all my debt and then become Wendy's personal bitch boy for the better portion of my life, reflecting on where I went wrong as I shovel grease into the mouths of meatbags. If this portion of the plan succeeds, then after paying back the principle and one to two month's worth of interest (how long I think the decline will last), I should obtain a return of at least x10.\n\n***NOTE:*** *i failed math class. number may vary.*\n\nNext up is the stagnation period of the crash. I will be taking some of the gains out of the brokerage account lock in my win. The rest will be scaled into discounted stocks (likely blue chips with decent dividend yields and leveraged ETFs). On top of scaling in, selling iron condors would also be considered. If it turns out that the economy will undergo another v-shaped recovery like last time, I'll kiss goodbye to most of my winnings, but still make it out with a profit.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nAnyone got a better alternative for taking advantage of the market crash without going full retard and yoloing your mortgage in deep OTM Tesla calls expiring in six minutes? Am I overlooking an opportunity or flaw in my plan? Did you even bother reading all of the post? Is everyone still holding onto GME?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI'm certainly not a doomer (or god forbid, a gay bear), but I do recognize crashes do happen and I just want to utilize extreme leverage to make a hefty gain after it's all said and done. But I do struggle to make five bucks on a ten thousand dollar account, so what the fuck do I know.",

My gf is kind of sick of it, because obviously it\u2019s annoying to have to pick up your bf all the time and I can\u2019t really take her out on a real date she basically does \ud83d\udc80. I\u2019m still in high school too so my friend has to pick me up everyday and then drive me home. I have a job but i\u2019ve been saving about 70-90% of my paycheck and putting it into stocks. I have about $1300 right now but with the current used market you can\u2019t really find anything half decent for less than $2500-3000. Would it be smart to sell my stocks for a car? Or should I just suck it up and keep mooching rides off people?",

        "selftext": "Pretty self explanatory. You may not believe things will go down, and if so it\u2019s not my intention to argue \u2014 I\u2019m familiar enough with investing to know value stocks will win if held in the long run and I understand we\u2019re in the greatest bill run in history BUT I can\u2019t help but see breaks in the dam. I\u2019m looking to make money when things go down. \n\nMostly concerned with:\n\n1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks \u2014 inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies \n2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we\u2019re at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won\u2019t be able to stay around without massive price increases \n3. Inflation isn\u2019t transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It\u2019s not just cars. Unless there\u2019s more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb \n4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating\n\nYou may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we\u2019re back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold \u2014 and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.\n\nIf you think this is possible, or heck even if you don\u2019t, humor me and let me know how you\u2019d invest. I\u2019ve got some shares of FAZ, SPXU, and UVIX because they seem to have blown up when interest rates racheted up in fall of 18 and I expect a similar performance when the fed realizes it can\u2019t print its way out of the PE bubble it\u2019s created. \n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "What's up retards, this week I may have found the best play I have EVER found to make you fucking RICH!\n\nDon\u2019t you HATE how your wife\u2019s boyfriend calls YOU a cuuck?\n\nWell... after SENS, you can fire him and become your OWN wife\u2019s boyfriend! Doesn\u2019t it sound nice to have her ALL to yourself?\n\nNow that I got your smooth-brained attention, let me explain why SENS is going to the FUCKING MOOON  \n\n\n**About the Company:**\n\nThis play is NOT based around the fundamental value of SENS, but it is important to know what the company is before investing\n\nSENS designs and manufactures Glucose monitoring systems. Their flagship device goes under the skin and transmits data to their app in real time! Their accuracy in real-time monitoring is revolutionary, especially considering that their newest transmitter lasts up to 180 days\n\nThey are currently awaiting FDA approval on the 180 day sensor, but have cleared most major regulatory hurdles\n\nKnowing that they are creating a good product clears some of the risk\n\nOK now that we got that boring shit out of the way, let me show you the REAL fun!  \n\n\n**Options Market:**\n\nSens has an INSANELY bullish options market with a put/call ratio of 0.2! This means that for every put, there are 5 MORE call options purchased!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2l7f1dhs5am71.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d48899e2ecf89dd2705d9996efc900c9e89f86a6\n\nEVEN including meme stocks, this is the HIGHEST P/C ratio I have EVER SEEN\n\nA high open interest and P/C ratio mean two things; the market thinks this stock will go up, and this has a potential for a gamma squeeze\n\nThe open interest on just 9/17 expiry is INSANE\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ui55d21u5am71.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=600508d2ac83260cfba660b4da4652452967eb0f\n\nThis means that ANY increase in IV or price of the underlying stock will lead to MM\u2019s purchasing a shit ton of shares to \u2018gamma hedge\u2019 to stay delta-neutral, which in turn will lead to a chain reaction of MM\u2019s buying shares to hedge which causes the price and IV to increase further\n\nEvery stock/option you buy will be multiplied by this effect, giving you a MUCH larger influence over the price of the stock\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nDespite making a good product and having an insanely bullish options market, shorts have over-shorted this stock up to 30% SI!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1setq0yv5am71.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=889840adc77bcbb2250f1dd1e7891f5c4372dbb8\n\nAdditionally, over the past few weeks about 45% of the daily volume has been sold short\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gmvqiqw5am71.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754d41ce9b3c815b5c9e52fb3c8a12a2d25ca1c3\n\nThese numbers alone don\u2019t necessarily mean shorts will cover their positions\u2026 But if you include the bullish options market, which is primed for a gamma squeeze, and a potential FDA approval, you begin to see why shorts are fucked and will begin to close their positions soon. All this stock needs is a catalyst...  \n\n\n**Possible Catalysts:**\n\nThe main catalyst I see for a short squeeze is full FDA approval on their 180 day sensor. Once it is approved, many shorts who were betting on the company going bankrupt will get out\n\nA few shorts covering mixed with such high open interest and new investors getting in will lead to a massive price spike and the potential to trigger margin calls on over-leveraged short positions\n\nThe more likely situation I see though is an immediate spike followed by slow exits from short positions. I don\u2019t see a massive M O A S S happening, but instead steady upwards momentum as shorts close their positions\n\nI see the 180 day sensor being approved within the next 1-2 months as their 90 day sensor has already been cleared awhile ago and their 180 day sensor has cleared most regulatory requirements already  \n\n\n**Positions:**\n\n10 $3.5 C 9/17, 10 $4 C 9/17, 20 $4.5 C 9/17, 20 $5 C 9/17, 10 $3.5 C 10/15, 8 $4 C 10/15, 20 $4.5 C 10/15 100 shares  \n\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0momzv06am71.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a19241f65d85abaee8926289751f41cef126725",

        "selftext": "Affirm reports earnings tonight and is expected to report USD 226m in revenue, which would be a decrease from their Q1 revenue of USD 231m. Guidance for Q3 is expected to hit 233m. I think the expectations are lowballed and Affirm will outdo them. The price has cooled down a bit since its recent jump, and this stock has already seen a lot of volume at higher prices than it is at today.\n\n**Increasing consumer adoption**\n\nWhen Afterpay started becoming successful, Affirm started attempts to move towards being a consumer company in a similar vein, which seems to be paying off now. Their app downloads this Quarter were the best they have ever been, and much higher than in the same quarter of last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6acfw397jhm71.png?width=1615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee1c355673cb256324d8a2ebd159b03fbf0a510e\n\n**Partners outdoing expectations**\n\nAffirm's biggest customer is Peloton who just had a mixed quarter. However hardware sales were still solid and I don't think the product recall will be taken up by too many people. Walmart and Target both just had big quarters, as well as the travel industry were travel bookings were up bigly in Q2 (although the outlook of those is a bit more mixed now with the Delta variant), Bestbuy, Figs, etc.. Referrals to Affirm's website from partners (what happens when you click on the \"Pay with Affirm\" button on e.g. Walmart's website) increased steadily since the beginning of this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf7lxywtkhm71.png?width=1349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c83faf99687fef4a1efc8b446181f461123a4fa\n\n**Industry trends in BNPL favoring Affirm**\n\nWith partnerships with Amazon and Shopify, Affirm is now a fixed player in ecommerce. Those companies prefer to keep the number of payment options low, so it is unlikely they will ever add more BNPL companies/loaners or replace Affirm. Affirm is now tied to 4 out of the Top 5 ecommerce companies and just launched a Canadian partnership with the 5th one (Apple). Affirm is probably the only pure play BNPL provider that can't be commoditized away. There will be some more consolidation to come for sure and I think these markets are pretty hot right now.\n\n**Positions**\n\nSince IV is quite high for my taste, I decided to go with a bull spread for this play. I'm pretty confident that numbers will be good and the stock price will at least be stable. I reach my maximum profit if Affirm is trading over 90 by expiry. Maximum profit and loss are both 24k. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulq92qy77im71.png?width=301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc3fe5c68aa32c1c7ee84ca049707382bd233a39",

I\u2019m just a smooth brained ape that likes seeing flamey sticks go up high in the sky. \n\n\u2022 Rocketlab is literally the only main competitor to Elon\u2019s Space X, currently valued well over 15x RKLB\u2019s value.\n\u2022 They have over 100 successful launches of their 3D printed Electron rockets and will be launching from the US this year.\n\u2022 Currently developing their Neutron Rocket which will be very similar to the Falcon 9, given their track record I fully believe they\u2019ll have this is in operation by their target year of 2024. Of course, Space X is ahead of them in this regard, but there is room for competition in this sector. \n\u2022 Developing on-orbit refuelling, this is something Space X are also developing with Starship, Rocketlab want to do this with their Electron satellites, which are currently operational, so it\u2019s very possible they could do this before Space X.\n\u2022 Their CEO literally ate his hat in a promo video. He\u2019s New Zealand Elon Musk, what else is there to say?\n\u2022They already have contracts from NASA and the US Space Force.\n\u2022 Cathie is very likely to add RKLB to her Space ETF soon, which will increase the price.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible they could reach Space X levels of valuation in the next 5-10 years. That would represent a 1500% gain. \n\nAs the space industry grows, who knows how big they could get beyond that?",

All we know is that they\u2019re drawing down rapidly and outside of government entities, most of the stockpiles are spoken for by utilities, which are using their uranium to fabricate finished products for their reactors. However, a new class of investors has entered the market and they\u2019ve completely upended the equilibrium.\n\nRemember, GBTC?? I remember it quite fondly. What if I told you there\u2019s another entity doing the same thing in uranium, but it is cornering the free float at a rate that makes the boys at GBTC look like amateurs? What if the free float is organically shrinking due to the supply deficit? What will happen as institutional investors jam themselves into a far smaller market? Fukit, who cares? Someone intends to conduct this science experiment; consequences be damned. Importantly, this entity is using an At The Market offering (ATM). Hence, it immediately produces free trading shares; increasing trading volume far more rapidly than GBTC with its 6-month hold\u2014making acquisition by institutional investors possible and driving adoption. Basically, it\u2019s GBTC 2.0\u2014issue shares to buy product. Every day. Relentlessly. Except, against a smaller and shrinking asset class.\n\nUranium is different\u2014almost everyone who owns uranium today, owns it because they intend to consume it in their reactors\u2014these owners are all incremental buyers going forward. In a market with a deficit, they\u2019re all implicitly short uranium. With an entity buying up the free float, they\u2019re going to get squeezed. We all know how squeezes work, but I don\u2019t know of any similar scenario where the squeeze was as aggressive or blatant. The utilities are blissfully unaware, they\u2019re eventually going to panic and pay any price for uranium as a reactor that runs out of uranium is just an expensive paperweight.\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust commonly known as SPUT (SRUUF\u2013 Canada), is the entity that has upended the uranium market. **Since launching its ATM 13 days ago, it has acquired 2.7 million pounds of uranium**. This is an average daily rate in excess of 200,000 pounds or roughly a third of global production on an annual basis**. If GBTC is the roadmap to follow, as the price of uranium begins to appreciate, the inflows into the trust should accelerate. Interestingly, there are plenty of other entities also purchasing physical uranium, uranium that utilities were counting on for their future needs. The squeeze is on.**\n\nAs expected, the utilities are blissfully unaware. Surprised?? I\u2019m not. Utilities are quasi-governmental agencies, managed by the types of fukwits who\u2019d work at your local DMV, except they enjoy stock options. The fact that they\u2019ve ignored the coming squeeze shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Inevitably, they\u2019ll demand rate increases to buy back this uranium\u2013it\u2019s not their money anyway. This is your bid at some point in the future.\n\nCommodities are determined by supply and demand. Uranium is a small market at roughly $6.3 billion in annual consumption (180 million pounds at $35/lb). SPUT has raised approximately $85 million in the 13 days since the ATM went live. It\u2019s hoovering up supply and is already struggling to procure pounds, as shown by their increasing cash balance\u2014cash that they\u2019re legally forced to spend. \n\n**Something is going to give here, and I suspect it\u2019s the price of uranium.**\n\nIn any case, when I saw the rate at which SPUT was issuing shares, I legged into a rather large pile of SPUT. I\u2019m also long a few producers along with some juniors for extra kick. (Please don\u2019t ask me which\u2014if I wanted to name them, I would have). Uranium just broke out to 5-year highs. New highs bring in publicity, which often brings in new buyers and the cycle repeats. I like buying new highs from a big base\u2014especially with SPUT out there playing Pac-Man. I pulled back my exposure all summer as I was awaiting something interesting. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see anything better than uranium for a while. Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m suddenly back to being VERY fully invested.\n\nBy Tyler Durden - On zero hedge\n\nI'm IN. This could be massive.",

        "selftext": "So after asking you guys for advice on my virginity problem the thing that stood out most was the question \"Have you asked your wife's boyfriend?\". I was very confused about this. Why would she have a boyfriend? We are married after all?\n\nBut because I have so much faith in this community, I decided to ask my wife about it. It took me all the courage I had build up from the past 10 years. But I did it. Her response may not surprise many of you. \"Ofcourse I have a boyfriend\", she said. \"You really think I just don't have sex? Like at all?\". Obviously this shocked me. I've been a virgin my whole life. How uncommon is this? I was very confused.  \n\nSo obviously first thing I asked was what this guy's name was. \"Dan\", she said. \"Dan?\", I said. \"Are you kidding me? Both our kids are called Dan. Next thing you're going to tell me is I'm not the father of our kids?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We've never had sex\", she said. \"Ofcourse you're not\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell that just blew my mind guys. I'm still overwhelmed. Don't really know what to think anymore. It does however explain why she didn't like the name Palantir. I'm a little down but not to be worried cause atleast I have you guys.\n\nI guess the next step would be to actually ask \"Dan\" for permission. Any tips on how to do that?

        "selftext": "I have been trading SPY 0-1 DTE options in my Roth IRA. \n\nI trade daily expiring calls that usually cost about $1 per contract and have a 0.5 delta so a $1 SPY move is roughly a 50% gain (SPY only goes up, and I never bet against America since puts are anti American \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaa). It\u2019s well within my personal risk tolerance and honestly is a little bit too conservative for my liking, so I\u2019m hoping CBOE introduces hourly expiring options. \n\nWhile using some Michael Bury genius level thinking, I discovered a seemingly foolproof SPY trading strategy. \n\nI noticed that options do not go below $0.01. If I buy a bunch of SPY calls at $0.01, like 10,000 or 100,000, I can\u2019t sell them for less than the $0.01 and I only need it to go to $0.02 to double my money. Since SPY has amazing liquidity I\u2019m guessing the market makers will buy them back from me for $0.01 if it doesn\u2019t go up. If it somehow goes ITM and hits $1 I will make 100x my investment. It seems like free money, and honestly, I feel like I have no money at risk. I feel like it would be like an ultra high APR savings account. My bank account gives me 0.01% APR, this might get me 100-100,000% return which is way cooler. \n\nMy many dollars will soldier on and Tuesday will mark a great innovation to SirYoloGod\u2019s strategy which might make me 100x richer in one day without downside risk. \n\nI hope the great minds of WSB can guide me through this strategy.

So what is so appealing about it? The only way I can understand it is if you are trading with a 500k+ account but even then why risk it?

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part 0: Intro\n\nSup freaks. Just came back from the moon and that shit is glorious. Here to officially introduce you to a play I\u2019ve been loading up on for weeks. The company is Genius Sports Limited, ticker $GENI, aka GENIE, or as Forrest Gump would say Jennaaaaay. You may be wondering why I\u2019m here? I\u2019m clearly (newly) rich, I should get a life. The answer is simple. I\u2019m a degenerate and it's short hunting season. Pow Pow. The FUD\u2019r of interest is forensic bitch and noted short seller Spruce Point Capital Management. These guys are incredibly ***unsuccessful*** in their calls so I take this as a major bull flag that they released a short report on GENI. Spruce\u2019s past successes include: MGNI (moon shot/money printer), DBX (DropBox), Nova (rose 88% after their post, talk about poor timing). These guys have the Midas Touch, ***anything their*** ***fungus filled fingernails*** ***stroke eventually end up moonshotting***; I\u2019m here to expedite the process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kw02izf6xbm71.gif\n\nAnyway, Genius Sports Limited (GENI) is a tech company that collects data from sports events, processes it, and sells it to major gambling companies to run their sportsbooks (SKLZ, DKNG, Fanduel, Caesars etc). They are the [pick &amp; shovel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pick-and-shovel-play.asp) play of a rapidly growing sports gambling segment ([gambling record $44bn in revenue 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/)). They have 4 competitors (large moat) but only Sportradar offers any real competition. GENI has deals with NASCAR, MLB, NBA, NCAA and the English Premier League amongst others. They are also the [official data partner of the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) holding exclusive rights; dump truck sized moat. Prominent investors include Cathie Wood, Mrs \u201cAverage Down at all Costs\u201d, Anpanaman \u201cGod Tier SPAC Wizard &amp; [wsb Yolo\u2019r](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/) (1.1m+ [\ud83d\ude33](https://emojipedia.org/flushed-face/))\u201d, amongst others (institutional ownership is 90%+). But, before we get into more specifics about the company + setup please watch this educational video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA)\n\nYup, I also love Christina Aguilera. So, gals put on your crop top and cargo pants, and fellas that backward fitted &amp; baggy jeans. Let\u2019s get groovy 90s style. Oh and Christina, please slide in my DM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bug2kfcaxbm71.gif\n\npls respond \n\n# Part 1: Fundamentals\n\nGENI is the backbone/infrastructure play on sports betting since they supply the  data that major gambling companies use.  GENI offers a suite of four products:\n\n* **GeniusLive**: this is a vertically integrated video service that allows teams or sports leagues to launch something like NBA League Pass. So the platform supports payments, live statistics, advertising, live streaming, and video on-demand, without having to buy a bunch of extra software/hardware. \n* **Sporttech:** Data capture, management and analysis tools that help leagues run their sport, unlock new revenue streams, and protect the integrity of their competitions. This is essentially the shit that has turned Facebook from some site used to scam on girls in  college into a company with revenues of over $10B a year. GENI collects all the data from degenerate bets, and provides the information gathered from them to their partners for future use. \n* **Sportsbook:** GENI provides the capability (but not requirement) to build out an entire sportsbook platform for their partners.  This provides all the benefits of having a sportsbook with none of the risk of spending capital on a field GENI partners are unfamiliar with.\n* **Media &amp; Engagement:**  GENI has the platform capabilities to allow their partners sports betting experience to enter into the world of social media.  You can chat in real time with other sports betters and complain that Nick Chubb stepped out at the 1 yard line and completely boned your 3 bet parlay. Through this platform GENI can leverage their fan engagement capabilities to drive advertising revenue and also promote future bets that may be to your liking based on your prior activity.\n\nAs  mentioned Genie\u2019s only real competition in this space is Sportradar, but Sportradar\u2019s [SPAC merger fell through](https://www.casino.org/news/sportradar-filed-for-a-highly-anticipated-ipo-on-tuesday/) after GENI swooped the exclusive rights to the NFL from under them -- ya know, the ole\u2019 Bulgarian ambush perfected by Vlad. \n\nThe NFL deal is pretty significant so let\u2019s dive into it: \n\n* **Expensive af**: Genius will [pay the NFL $120 million a year over six years](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/), with half paid in warrants making the [NFL own roughly 5% of GENI](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nfl-stake-genius-nearly-15-215504358.html). \n* **Locked in profit**:  Sportradar was pulling in 1.5% to 2% of in-play gross gaming revenue (GGR) on NFL wagers \\[[source](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/)\\].  Genius decided to go the opposite route by jacking up rates; asking for around 4% of operators\u2019 pre-match NFL betting revenues and 6% of in-play \\[[source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)\\]. Operators are big mad about this:\n\n&gt;*\"They don\u2019t really have anything new,\u201d said another operator exec. \u201cThey are charging 4x for the same dataset.\u201d*\n\nThese guys are forced to use Genie\u2019s official NFL Data either because they are official partners of the NFL (FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesar), state regulations require use of official data, or the TV networks force them to subscribe to Genie data to advertise.  As of now, [DraftKings has already partnered with GENI in a multi year deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/draftkings-partners-with-genius-sports-for-sports-betting.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1628161383), PointsBet, WynnBet, BetMGM, Caesars, and Fox Bet have also signed deals w/ Genius ([NFL names Fox Bet, PointsBet, BetMGM and WynnBet as Approved Sportsbook Operators](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/12973/nfl-names-fox-bet-pointsbet-betmgm-and-wynnbet-as-approved-sportsbook-operators)).  This leaves only Fanduel as yet to be disclosed, but likely already signed with Genie. Senior operator exec\u2019s legit crying that [its a monopoly.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)lol. Sucks for them, great for us.\n\n* **Sticky**: The Sportradar deal was inked in 2019 and they got cucked in 2021. Sad. GENI is proactively making moves to make the deal last longer than 6yrs by hiring a good amount of NFL vets. Including [Steve Bornstein](https://www.sportico.com/personalities/executives/2021/genius-sports-steve-bornstein-1234637226/), he now leads GENI\u2019s US business. Mans spent a decade at the NFL managing the media strategy, and spent multiple decades at ESPN and ABC.  He also was the CEO of ESPN for a cool min.   \n* **NFL shills for GENI**:  This cannot be reinforced enough: the NFL\u2019s chief concern is the integrity of the data provided, and they are entrusting GENI, and ONLY GENI, with that.  They will also force anyone who wants to do business with the NFL to adhere to the NFL\u2019s core integrity policies by [agreeing to license all Official League Data from GENI](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-announces-agreements-with-four-approved-sportsbook-operators)\n\nTo put this in simpler terms: the NFL is telling the world -if you want us, you\u2019re gettin\u2019 some GENI.   GENI also issued warrants to the NFL (5% stake in GENI)  meaning when GENI is successful the NFL is successful so they are locked in and incentivized to push GENI to anyone who wants to work with them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/l3e1xpncxbm71.gif\n\nThe reason I\u2019m bullish on Genie and jacked with shares/options other than the regular \u201c*it could squeeeeez*e\u201d play which I know, love, and bang the shit out of, and will explain this angle later, is because Genie secured the NFL deal at the perfect time. So, 3 yrs ago the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting. The NFL has responded by moving its business model towards generating significant amts of revenue through betting. Sucks for Sporttrader, since for most of the time they held the  exclusive rights to NFL data, the [NFL actually considered gambling to be threat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)**\ud83d\ude31**, what a bad position to be in going into the gambling golden age.  \n\nThe NFL expects to make $270m in revenue from sports-betting this yr, and  NFL execs are super bullish about their future sports betting revenue, here\u2019s a quote from one: *\u201c*You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade.*\u201d\\[*[*source*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)*\\]* \n\nThe ideal sports-gambling legislation, the NFL concluded, would include substantive licensing requirements creating clear and transparent markets that protect consumers. Bets needed to be resolved using the league\u2019s official data (GENI!! - fuck you, pay me.). There had to be prohibitions on betting by insiders and the onus placed on operators to make certain that wasn\u2019t occurring. \\[[source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)\\] \n\nSo, when I invest I try to think of analogies that speak to me. This lets me invest in a more  logical and clear headed way. I compare this situation to the girl that sat next to you pre-OnlyFans. She used to eat ramen for lunch. A couple years later she has a poodle, a G Wagon, and goes by \u201cCyrstal like the champagne\u201d instead of Bernice. Yah, she twerking on cam because she found a money printer, the NFL will twerk to online-betting.  Analogy.\n\nThe whole industry will be twerking. \n\nCathie Wood\u2019s a month before she started yolo\u2019n on Jenaaay estimated x10 increase in domestic sports betting handle (the amount of money wagered by bettors is called \u201chandle\u201d), to $180 billion by 2025 , with revenue\u2019s for the sector projected to sky at a 31% CAGR. \n\nOne reason for this bullish prediction is the New Jersey example; since NJ legalized online sports betting mid-2018, they've seen online handle moon to $15 billion, 1/2 of this took place in 2020. (*Don\u2019t know why people would yolo on sports and* [*not options*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/)*, but to each their own lulz*).\n\nSportsbetting is picking up so much steam, ESPN keeps their own tracker for up to date info on which states are going to let you yolo rent $ on Appalachian State vs Syracuse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g68ri70exbm71.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e3af4ca366eb8d64ba23ac0f970d51bdac69b8\n\nThere are only 3 states (Utah, Idaho, and Wisconsin - which btw if you live in any of these places - move the fuck out) that do not currently allow for sports betting and/or are in the process of allowing it.  Ground floor opportunity here.\n\n[Earlier this month, Wyoming Awarded Genius Sports Inaugural Sports Betting License - upping the number of states GENI can operate in to 15. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wyoming-awards-genius-sports-inaugural-213000130.html)\n\nSo clearly Jenaayy is a growth stock but let\u2019s look at the fundamentals &amp; also how Genie compares to the competition. (Genie, Jenaayy, GENI, Genius \u2026 lol sorry I\u2019m  dislexic). Ya so  Sportradar (Genie\u2019s rival)  is slated to go public this year and will likely trade in the $10-12B valuation range \\[[article/source](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2021/sportradar-ten-billion-valuation-1234623092/)\\].\n\nSportradar filed its S-1 a few weeks ago which provides historical financial performance.  Making some simple assumptions on continued revenue growth (based on historic CAGR) we can figure out Sportradar\u2019s valuation multiples which we\u2019ll compare to Jenaayyy\u2019s.  I\u2019m also throwing in Draftkings in the comparison as a high growth (but unprofitable), pure play sportsbook leader.  You can see below how the financials compare:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f6alqkfxbm71.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c25a5c75f0ca5b4498d9883053284138e273ec7\n\nI would argue Genie and Sportradar should trade at a premium to Draftkings as they have an effective duopoly on the sports betting data market.  Draftkings\u2019 sports book market is getting more competition from new players, which is causing customer acquisition costs to skyrocket.  HOWEVER, as more of these players enter the market, they\u2019ll have to buy all their official sports data from Jenaayy!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fk2cxfmgxbm71.gif\n\nLet\u2019s get serious for a sec,, below is a valuation comparison and as you can see Genie trades at a discount to DKNG and at a premium to Sportradar\u2019s expected IPO pricing valuation of $26-29 or $7.4B - $8.2B. It\u2019s expected that Sportradar will trade in the $10B - $12B range once it starts trading.  Genie should probs trade at a premium to Sportradar valuation given the enormous potential of its exclusive NFL deal over the coming years. Vauling Genie at a premium would imply a conservaitve estimate of $25 to $30 price per share based on the company\u2019s CURRENT projections..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f75x253ixbm71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a6d0efe77944fcd133102ba7e3424f6b93b026\n\nGenie reported Q2 earnings on 9/8 which beat estimates.  Revenue was $55.8M and EBITDA $5.2M vs. street estimates of revenue $53.8M and EBITDA $1.7M.  Genie tightened its FY2022E guidance to $250M-$260M of revenue (which was increased in Q1 from $190M) and EBITDA of $10M-$20M.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for i though, Wall Street analysts agree with their Price Targets:\n\n* Benchmark BUY $33 PT\n* Oppenheimer BUY $32 PT\n* Goldman Sachs BUY $31 PT\n* Craig Hallum BUY $30 PT\n* Needham BUY $28 PT\n* Singular Research BUY $28 PT\n\nThese 12-month price targets equate to an average $30.33 or 43 % upside from the current stock price.\n\nSome other data points:\n\n* Tute ownership 44.17%\n* GENI is in a $330M net cash position \n* Does it pay a dividend? Of course not\n* Free cash flow is absolutely atrocious - the company is in reinvest and GROWTH mode\n* Holy fuck is price to sales looks steep based on 2020A at 27.9x, but gets cut in half by 2022E at 12.3x due to massive growth\n* Positive seasonality outlook, very volatile but shows recently strong performance\n* Sales forecast looks great, with a forecasted growth of 126% from 2020 to 2022\n* First quarter group revenues of 52% year-over year\n* First quarter group adj. EBITDA up 414% to 9.3M\n* 6-year exclusive partnership with NFL\n* Has exclusive events with almost every professional sports agency, as well as tournaments\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74rp8m1jxbm71.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b50991702a45037e079fd174fc5bf6f870269c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hyzbzw4kxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 2: Institutional fuckery\n\nSpruce Point Capital Management [issued a hit piece](https://www.casino.org/news/genius-sports-stock-could-see-big-declines-says-noted-short-seller/) on Genie. Their primary claim is that Genius is a \u201cmiddleman\u201d with an \u201cinferior business model\u201d saying the stock could fall 60% to 80%, so a PT of $3.25 to $6.50. Well first off Spruce, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/uk0m1vhlxbm71.gif\n\nWith that being said, Spruce is clearly wrong. Given Spruce\u2019s history of abject failure I would go further and say this report is baseless FUD. So, why would Spruce put itself in the path of a runaway train like Jenaay? Seems crazy tbh. Welp they\u2019re known as a [\u201cSmash &amp; Grab\u201d short seller,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-jolts-activist-short-hedge-funds-into-adapt-or-die-mode) so these guys give friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public, profiting from the panic.  Spruce\u2019s hit piece was released Aug 5th, the stock rose the entire day and it\u2019s been in a legit uptrend since then, no panic lol. If this is Spruce\u2019y bois M.O. they just fukd their company and their friends with another horrible call. [It seems like Sprucey\u2019s gone into hiding, hoping this all blows over. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/enqy9vfmxbm71.gif\n\nNow it\u2019s Cathie Wood\u2019s turn to polish off Spruce\u2019s beautiful thighs. Cathie started loading the boat Aug 5, the same day of Spruce\u2019y bois FUD article, and the same day of the DKNG transformative day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkj42psoxbm71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04cf19309a136cec0b60564b0d881b2db1894769\n\nCan\u2019t help but respect Cathie\u2019s bullish buying. More importantly however, is this rising floor Cathie is building into the stock price. She is known for having strong convictions and sticking to them. She\u2019ll buy a dip &amp; take the ride. \n\n[But don\u2019t take my word for it. Check out this big, green, dildo. Cathie, you bad.](https://cathiesark.com/arkw/trends)\n\nIf you need any more proof, let\u2019s take a look at the near-100%-of-float institution rate. It\u2019s almost as if GENI has an unconscionably small float that\u2019s being aggressively bought by diamond handz Cathie while the MM buys remaining float shares to hedge calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qtw0aerxbm71.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b125abc619b0d2f3f96966ac63eff445603328cf\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ipnyrecsxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 3: Float and Lizard \n\nLizard theory has evolved since my [$NEGG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/) and SPuRT posts. Other redditors have come up with extensions of the general idea. I\u2019m going to do a breakdown of similar data from past analysis, including FTD rates and float comparisons, institutional ownership and recalculation of all this data (differs from online). \n\nAs of now, the outstanding shares listed on Yahoo and sites such as [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/geni/statistics/) is 191.51M shares. \\[However, the float varies, with Yahoo listing it as 63.36M and other sites listing it as 58.66M.\\] \n\n**The current float can be calculated as follows:**  \nSPAC IPO:    27.6M shares\n\nUnlocked PIPE:   33M shares\n\nFollow-On Offering:   22M shares\n\n**Total tradable float:**   **82.6M shares**\n\n**Lock up:**\n\nManagement (34.9M shares / 18% ownership) lockup expires on 11/17 and the SPAC Sponsor lockup (6.825M shares / 3.5% ownership) lockup expires on 10/17.  Apax, the private equity owner of Genius (60.2M shares / 30.9% ownership) lockup will expire on 10/17.  The gory details are all laid out here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img i8iutvjtxbm71...*\n\nThey also list the institutional ownership as around 44-45% but doing some calculations shows this is higher. \n\n**So is this an overcount or undercount? Lets see.** \n\n**Begin Math:** \n\nGiven **191.51M shares outstanding** as the general consensus across various financial sources, we can look into the overall preferred shares and institutional buyouts across several 13F filings and aggregated data on Fintel and StockAnalysis:\n\n**Top 3 Institutional Holdings:**\n\n1. Caledonia Investments - 16,305,582 shares\n2. Fred Alger Management - 15,046,102 shares\n3. Dmy Sponsor LLC - 6,825,000 shares\n\nThese top 3 holders combined have 38176684 shares or about 19.93% of the shares outstanding. \n\nThere are 137 other funds that also own shares directly, for a total of 63694543 shares or about another 33.26% of the shares outstanding. \n\nTherefore, institutional ownership alone is around (19.93% + 33.26%) or 53.19% of shares outstanding. \n\nNext we can take a look at the insider transactions. This has a general consensus of 19.25%, indicating that a total of 72.44% of the outstanding shares are owned currently. \n\nNow lets take a look at merger deals, ETFs and ownership through mutual funds. \n\nWe can see that the top holders for Q2 of 2021 in aggregate own 17,422,176 shares or about 9.10% of shares outstanding.  \\[source fintel\\]\n\n**Our total ownership of outstanding shares becomes 81.54%.** \n\nHowever, now we need to account for any institutions holding shares through these funds and for this reason some ETFs are excluded. Fred Alger Management has 15,046,102 shares of GENI yet through the ATFV Alger\u2019s ETF, they end up owning approximately\u2026 oh wait.. Lol\u2026 approximately an equivalent of 75 shares of GENI. Okay so looking at these ETFs looks like they have negligible impact on the float. \n\n**TLDR; The float for $GENI is about 35,352,746 shares or about 18.46% of outstanding shares.**  **With 4.14M** shares shorted this means that approximately **11.7% of the float is shorted.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvse6w5vxbm71.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab367a73760c2e67324adb2459b7797512f474f7\n\nFrom the FTD angle we see that nice giant spike with the price staying stable/bleeding up. This type of pattern I\u2019ve found to give more pop, and it\u2019s something I looked for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cudusyyvxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 4: Flow\n\n***Options Flow***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q9vahxuwxbm71...*\n\nOrder Sentiment: ***Bullish*** AF. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3brekt. 77% of options activity over the last 30 days has been ***bullish.*** 66% of money invested has been placed on ***bullish*** bets of the stock rising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bya2smuxxbm71.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21f20b87f47c05a5df9c39ede3b8005e30a33b2\n\nCall OI has been trending up over the last month, you can see an increase in OI for higher strikes as GENI\u2019s share price has increased 34.43% over the last month. The smart money has been betting on the price increase continuing. \n\nThe option chain: there are only monthly options, and the options chain itself is somewhat condensed to near the money strikes. This is all actually a good thing. It is forcing investors to streamline their investments into a more concentrated area, which has a greater overall impact on both hedging requirements and overall stock price.
