        "selftext": "\nFor Trading April 8th\n \n \nSTOCKS RUN OUT OF GAS\n \nOil Falls, Again\n \n \nToday was a somewhat \u201crestive\u201d day, and while we moved for a total of over 315 S&amp;P-500 points, it felt pretty good to have a barely changed day.  The DJIA went from +937 to close 1,000 lower @-26.13 (.12%), NASDAQ -25.98 (.33%), S&amp;P 500 -4.27 (.19%), the Russell +.39 (.03%) and the DJ Transports +27.80 (.35%).  Market internals were about as you would expect for an unchanged day with NYSE A/D 2.3:1 and NASDAQ 1.3:1 with an increase in volume.  DJIA was 15:15 with NO triple-digit gains or losses and the leader, GS +53 DP\u2019s with the losers BA -49, PG -34, and WMT -27 DP\u2019s.  The strongest groups Energy (although the oil fell 7%, Financials, real estate, materials and industrials.  Consumer staples and health care were weak.  The early strength was from the possible leveling off of the virus cases and the momentum from yesterday.  The large cap technology names were weak from the start, but it\u2019s awfully hard to top the day AAPL had yesterday +21.00 (8.72%).  But the group gave up whatever gains it had by late afternoon with the only gainers being TSLA, FB, and AMZN (up only .40%).  The interesting thing today was the fact that the US$ was weak (-.8%) but both Oil and Gold were also lower.  This is tonight\u2019s closing comment:  https://youtu.be/8HoUm75j8Eg\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1400 members.\n \n \nSECTORS: Of all the names that moved higher yesterday in the virus treatment area the only IMMU, which doubled, managed to hold on to its gains finishing $18.91 +.13.  Inovio (INO) rallied up to $9.20 but fell back to 7.93 before closing $8.27 -.17 (2.01%), CODX, +2.11 or 26% yesterday also gave back half of it\u2019s gain to close $9.09 -1.22 (11.83%).\n \nIt was only a matter of time before someone would find a \u201cventilator\u201d manufacturer, but today, DPW Holdings, manufacturer of its Coolisys Power Electronics division received a major order last week and today announced that it had increased its offshore manufacturing capacity and that a customer was increasing an order.  The stock was up 85% last week and today it traded up to $1.95 before finishing the day $1.54 +.74 for a 92.50% gain.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was LOWER with BIIB -10.18, ABBV -.58, REGN -2.76, ISRG -12.24, MYL+ .64, TEVA +.20, VRTX -8.30, BHC +.58, INCY +1.55, ICPT +.65, LABU -1.47, and IBB $109.63 -2.08 (1.86%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.44, CGC +.21, CRON -.17, GWPH + 5.17 (5.97%), ACB +.01, PYX -.34, NBEV -.06, CURLF +.08, KERN +.10 and MJ $11.00 +.04 (.36%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was LOWER with LMT -10.45, RTX +.68, GD -.04, TXT -.72, NOC -6.93, BWXT -.83, TDY +6.73, and ITA $147.40 +.54 (.37%).\n \n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.27, JWN +1.94, KSS +3.07, DDS +1.87, JCP +.01, WMT -2.98, TGT +.64, TJX +.34, RL +5.19 (7.57%), UAA +.53, LULU +.05, TPR +1.43, CPRI +2.16 and XRT $31.00 +.79 (2.62%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL +.81, AMZN +12.41, AAPL -2.47, FB +4.20, NFLX -6.51, NVDA -8.40, TSLA +33.63 (6.51%), BABA -2.95, BIDU -2.45, BA -4.28, CAT +4.35, DIS +.42 and XLK $82.95 -.75 (.90%).\n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS the leader +9.73(6.15%), JPM +1.53, BAC +.83, MS +.23, C +.52, PNC -1.24, TRV +1.35, AXP +4.13 (4.92%) and XLF $21.25 +.21 (1.00%).\n \n \nOIL, $23.63 -2.45. The explosive moves in Oil recently has seemed to run its course and today\u2019s drop cut the gains by a touch more than half.  The stocks did not feel the effects of the price and most were higher.  XOM cut spending and said that their fundamental underpinnings remain strong.  CVX +1.00, XOM +.91, OXY +.61, NBL +.11, MRO +.14, MPC -.19, RIG +.08, APA +.71, BP -.05 and XLE $32.08 +.67 (2.13%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,683.70 -10.20. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1742 before falling back to close $60 off the highs and below $1700.  I would be a buyer a bit lower than today\u2019s close.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,330 unchanged. After we traded in a short-range day followed by a $1,000 range on Friday BTC closed above $7,000 for the first time since it broke to the downside early last month.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.67 -.28 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": "For Trading April 3rd\n \nOil Recovery\n \nTrading the Range\n \nJobless Claims Double\n \n \nToday was pretty constructive in that we opened lower with the futures and of course the blockbuster news of Mr. Trumps tweet (which I find not believable) about and Oil deal between Russia and the Saudi\u2019s, that sent us up to the high of the day +534, before we has some sideways action until around 1:15 when we started to sell-off and headed back to down on the day to -90 before we rallied and finished +469.93 (2.24%), NASDAQ +126.73 (1.72%), S&amp;P 500 +56.40 (2.28%), the Russell +13.81 (1.29%) and the DJ Transports +93.13 (1.27%).  There was plenty of news to start the day with Initial Jobless claims that were double the prior number at an astounding 6.6million.  Unfortunately, the number next month will be higher.  Tomorrow, we have the monthly employment number for March as well as the ISM non-manufacturing pre-open.  I regarded today\u2019s market action as very constructive.  The lower open and then rally and a second round-trip to a close near the highs was impressive.  While there is still plenty of work to be done, plenty of bad news on the economy and COVID-19 to come, we seem to be building some underlying support.  Market internals were positive but unimpressive with gains outnumbering losers by 1.4:1 on both NYSE and NASDAQ.  Volume was also lower that I would have liked to have seen.  On the DJIA there were 25 gainers to 5 losers with BA -50, UTX -36, and WBA-18DPs, while the gainers were led by CVX +50, PG and CAT +36 and MMM+32 DPs.  \n \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 800 members.\n \n \nSECTORS: Walgreen reported earnings today and although they had better than expected numbers, they gave less than stellar guidance and the stock fell to a lower low than the March bottom and made a new low close since 2013.  WBA fell to $39.41 and closed $40.32 -2.71 (6.3%).  We used the decline to buy some CVS calls, which has been consolidating and has outperformed its competitor.  Shopify suspended its guidance and the stock, another darling that was priced for perfection got slammed.  The stock, up from $20 in 2016 topped out over $593 in February had fallen to 303 last month but climbed back to $470 last week fell to $334.55 before closing 346.30 -38.37 (9.97%).\n \nAnd last, the Disaster Du Jour was Luckin Coffee (LK), the Chinese Starbucks, sort of.  The stock spent 7 months between $15 and $25 before taking off on a run from $18 to over $50 late last year.  It fell back to $28 but had traded up to $43 last month before starting down and closing just above $26 yesterday.  Unfortunately, the COO was found to have basically fabricated all of the results since Q2.  Muddy Waters wrote up the company on 1/31 saying it had \u201cevolved into a fraud.\u201d\nThe stock gapped down to open $4.92, rallied back to $10.58 buy gave up the gains and finished $6.40 -19.80 (75.57%).

The explosive move in Oil today was spurred on by an early morning tweet from Mr. Trump claiming that Russia and the Saudi\u2019s were close to an agreement.  My first thought was BS, but the market held and finished strong.  My only warning is that we have had several of these spikes that have failed with news that we knew was real.  The stocks were stronger across the board with CVX the big winner +7.56 (11.03%) and added 50 DPs.  XOM +3.12 (8.13%), OXY +2.05 (19%), OAS +.06, NBL +.47 (8%), MRO +.33, MPC +.58, RIG +.02, APA +.68 (16.92%), BP +1.80 (7.38%) and XLE $30.15 +2.53 (9.16%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,637.70 +46.30. After the recent gains, Gold has failed to break through the highs around $1700 and have fallen back.  Today\u2019s rebound is of little technical value.  I will reassess and look for a new entry point.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $6,865 +655. After we traded in another short-range day yesterday we had a range of over $1000 today, closing about midrange. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06.

The market in the oil was up a little, down a little, but when the futures rallied off the $10.00 level and moved to as high as $16.18, the turn in the market was right there following it.  We finished with the DJIA +456.94 (1.99%), NASDAQ +232.15 (2.81%), S&amp;P 500 +62.75 (2.29%), the Russell +16.43 (1.39%) and the DJ Transports (the only loser -3.78 (.05%).  There were only 3 DJIA names lower and only single digits with the gainers MCD +61, AAPL +53, V +40, MSFT +39, and INTC and HD adding 25 DPs.\nVolume was a little light with A/D 2.5:1 on NYSE and 2.2:1 on NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) was the strongest mover with energy number 2.  Consumer staples and financials were weak.  \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/YOGWiIDX-sM\n \nSECTORS: Earnings were a feature again with SNAP continuing higher after last night\u2019s numbers and finishing $17.01 +4.57 (37%).  TXN finished +5.14 (4.8%), and the biggest winner was CMG +95.57 (12.2%) on an earnings beat and a monster gain in digital business.\n \nExpedia (EXPE) is being courted by 2 private equity firms for a $1 Billion investment.  The stock is down from $144 last year to hit $40.76 in March but finished the day $61.42 +4.17 after trading as high as $64.12.  I\u2019m sure that these two firms are much smarter than I, but I can\u2019t see the upside for a very long time.  When restaurants reopen, capacity will be cut, same for hotels and cruise ships.  I have no idea how long planes will be required to fly with smaller loads, but there are just too many \u201cunknowns\u201d to plunk $1 billion down for hospitalities.  Just saying.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with the big exception being BIIB.  It finished \u2013 31.51 (9.58%) on the news that its Alzheimer\u2019s drug will be delayed.  ABBV +1.42, REGN +13.26, ISRG +15.50, GILD +3.07, MYL -.21, TEVA +.05, VRTX +6.57, BHC +.24, INCY +1.51, ICPT -.14, LABU +1.96 and IBB $124.16 +1.74 (1.42%)\n \nCANNABIS: This group was MIXED with TLRY +.09, CGC -.14, CRON -.04, GWPH -1.40, ACB -.003, PYX -.09, NBEV +.03, CURLF +.015, KERN +.25 and MJ $11.50 +.21 (1.86%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +9.43, RTX +.80, GD +3.31, TXT +.46, NOC +8.83, BWXT +.94, TDY +6.37 and ITA $148.20 +.74 (.50%).\n \n  \nRETAIL: was LOWER with the exception of the discounters.

GOOGL +43.94, AMZN +31.88, AAPL +7.58, FB +11.52 (6.74%), NVDA +15.02, TSLA +43.28 (6.3%), BABA +2.99, BIDU +.01, CMG continuing higher in extended hours +104.37 (13.27%), BA -.48, CAT +1.03, DIS +.76, and\nXLK $87.30 +3.15 (3.74%).\n \n  \nFINANCIALS were SLIGHTLY HIGHER with GS +2.23, JPM +.37, BAC +.16, MS +.90, C +.67 PNC unchanged, AIG +.04, TRV +.01, AXP +.81, V +6.05, and XLF $21.56 +.27 (1.27%).\n \nOIL, $13.78 +2.21. Oil was the BIGGEST STORY of the day again with the June contract taking over and recovering from what was surely forced liquidation in May.  Remember, that this will happen again unless the market improves before May 19th.  Oil stocks were higher with APA + .85 (9.92%) and HES +3.01 (8.28%) and XLE $33.50 +1.19 (3.68%).\n \n  \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,738.00 +50.5 After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. Tuesday night it fell and hit $1,666 before coming back up $20. Today it rallied hard and I still expect much higher prices.  We are long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7115 + 225. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we\u2019d have to test 6750 and today we hit 6465 before turning back up.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.70 +.26 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

Bottom line here is that we had really split market with NASDAQ and Russell at opposite ends of the spectrum.  Consumer confidence fell hard to 86.9 vs 92 expected and Richmond Fed was -53 vs. +2 expected.  Market internals were mixed too, with NYSE 2.5:1 Up while the NAZ was only 9:7 higher.  Volume remained light.  The DJIA was 17 up, 13 down with the leaders MMM +28, GS +24, AXP +21, and DD and BA +18 DPs.  On the downside we had UNH -41, AAPL -31, MSFT -29 and JNJ -19 DPs.

PEP last night with a beat and was +1.86, CINF was a miss last night and gapped down this morning to 76.28 and just continued to fall to $71.27 before closing $71.81 -10.22 (12.46%).  On the upside we had HOG with a \u201cnot as bad as expected +2.88 (15.21%), ADS $47.60 +6.21 (15%), and ALK $31.58 +3.73 (13.39%).\n \nAfter the close we heard from Google and it was a beat on revenues and after closing $1232.59 -38.27 and after trading $1206.97, turned back higher and after hitting $1290 is currently $1267 +35.  SBUX was a slight miss and after closing 78.69 is now 77.60 -1.10.  AMD missed on expected revenue growth and after its recent move back from a recent low of $36.75 to over $58, fell to $52.40 and is $53.21 -2.29 (4.13%).\n \nAnd, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY is clearly Creative Realities (CREX), a small firm with a stock that closed $1.00 yesterday +22%, came out of the gate this morning unchanged and rallied on the news that it has a \u201cnon-contact temperature system\u201d that along with its AI enabled software \u201caddresses the urgent need for businesses and employers to build consumer confidence as the world goes back to work as stay at home orders are reduced throughout the U.S.\u201d  The stock traded as high as $5.15 and is currently 4.85 +3.85 or 385%...Clearly a home run.\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was HIGHER with TSN +2.51, BGS +1.50, FLO +.06, CAG +.05, MDLZ -.73, KHC +.25, CALM +.21, JJSF +1.92, SAFM +.35 and LANC +1.52.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was LOWER with BIIB +1.98, ABBV -1.64, REGN -18.91, ISRG -13.65, GILD -1.51, MYL +.30, TEVA +.17, VRTX -11.55 (4.3%), BHC -.41, INCY -5.31 (5.16%), ICPT -4.10, LABU -2.89 and IBB $124.86 -2.67 (2.09%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was LOWER with TLRY -.30, CGC -.53, CRON -.18, GWPH -1.67, ACB -.016, PYX -.14, NBEV -.04, CURLF -.28, KERN +.05 and MJ $12.40 +.02 (.16%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +8.23, RTX +.71, GD +2.74, TXT +.86, NOC +2.19, BWXT +.33, TDY +5.96 and ITA N$163.94 +2.88 (1.91%).\n  \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.51, JWN +.21, KSS +1.26, DDS +3.21 (11.35%), JCP +.026, WMT -.28, TGT +2.23, TJX +1.86, RL +3.61, UAA +.36, LULU -1.82, TPR +1.06, CPRI +1.18 and XRT $36.97 +.61 (1.68%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL the big exception on earning +74.34 (5.85%), AMZN -21.00, AAPL -2.48, FB +2.71, NFLX -15.68, NVDA -1.34, TSLA -22.25, BABA -1.69, BIDU -2.56, CMG -13.07, BA +2.22, CAT +.31, DIS +.60, and XLK $88.85 -.54 (.60%).\n \n  \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +3.57, JPM +1.03, BAC +.53, MS +.95, C +.89, PNC +.50, AIG +1.38, TRV +1.40, AXP +3.15, V +.74 and XLF $22.75 +.27 (1.2%).\n \n \nOIL, $112.34 -.44.

It didn\u2019t take long for those two to reverse and head lower.  This market cares absolutely nothing for the reality of the current situation.  We have a president who thinks he\u2019s a king and will do whatever he wants, whenever he wants and will reopen the economy on command.  His base may believe that, but it is 180 degrees opposite of what the science says.  The DJIA finished +558.99 (2.39%), NASDAQ +323.32 (3.96%), S&amp;P 500 +84.43 (3.06%), the Russell +25.29 (2.09%) and the DJ Transports +140.77 (1.75%, again a laggard).  The DJIA was 24:6 Up on the day with AAPL the big gainer +94 DPs, followed by HD +59, MSFT +56, UNH +47, and JNJ as standout who provided forward guidance and went against the trend and raised their dividend.  BA was the big loser on news that it had 150 orders 737MAX cancelled and fell 43 DPs with JPM and AXP also losers.  BTW, just an aside, there were 21 splits listed for the balance of April, ALL OF THE REVERSES.  These included several of the leveraged ETF names but also included Chesapeake Energy (CHK) with a 1:200 in order to stay on the NYSE.  Market internals were about average with NYSE A/D 3:1 and NADSAQ 2.4:1.  Volume was a touch below average.

On the small cap biopharma group, which has a new name popping up every day we had Sonnet Bio (SONN) another one of those wonderful reverses (1:10 and 1:26) trading $10.80 +5.86 preopen and followed by a run to $16.20 before finishing the day $7.99 +3.05 (61.74%) with no news except \u201ctrading halted, trading resumed.  MEI Pharma (MEIP) had good news in the receipt of $100MM payment and for its oral, once a day drug for \u201cB-cell malignancies.\u201d  I may be entitled to up to $582MM based on successful development.  The stock traded 2.91 +1.24 (74.8%) preopen and continued to open $3.05, trade up to $3.64 but selloff a bit to close $2.50 +.83 (49.7%).  Last in this group, RedHill Biopharma (RDHL) updated its progress with its drug, Opaganib, approved for compassionate use in Italy and Israel.  The COVID-19 treatment has been very successful.  In Israel, the treatment of just 2 patients demonstrated \u201cmeasurable clinical improvement within days of treatment initiation.\u201d  Patients needed decreased oxygen requirements, decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and increased lymphocyte levels.  One patient was treated in the ICU, considered for intubation and was released within days of treatment.  Although it traded as high as $22.22 in late 2015, it has not been reversed, it traded as low as $3.26 in March and worked its way higher and broke to the upside Monday 4/6 over $5.50 and has continued higher.  It closed today $7.51 +.63 (9.16%) after hitting $8.24.  So, not a one-day wonder, it has moved from $3.26 to $7.51 over the last 2 weeks.\n \nLast was ROKU reporting a big gain in revenues this morning.  This Lotto tick from $15 in 2017 to trade $176.55 in (9/19) fell back to $58.22 in March finishing the day $106.53 +9.97 (10.33%), almost doubling in just under a month.  \n\nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +10.82, ABBV +2.88, REGN +7.82, ISRG +20.46 (4.14%), MYL +.29, TEVA +.30, VRTX +12.22 (4.84%), INCY +3.27, ICPT +3.29 LABU +3.10 (11.41%) and IBB $118.55 +4.06 (3.55%).\n\nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.51, CGC +1.02, CRON +.22, GWPH +1.27, ACB - .004, PYX +.16, NBEV +.39, CURLF +.06, KERN +.10 and MJ $11.70 +.25 (2.18%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +15.04, RTX +3.91, GD +1.90, TXT +.06, NOC +9.94, BWXT +.65, TDY +6.27, and ITA $154.67 +4.04 (2.68%).\n  \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.02, JWN -.39, KSS +.24, DDS -1.16, JCP -.01, WMT +3.79, TGT +3.70, TJX +2.37, RL +.53, UAA +.41, LULU +5.93, TPR +.61, CPRI +1.38 (10.58%), and XRT $34.75 +1.47 (4.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with several big moves vs. the overall market, with GOOGL +54.59, AMZN +116.13 (5.35%), AAPL +14.15 (5.18%), FB +3.42, NFLX +15.51, NVDA +14.64 (5.43%), TSLA +61.70 (9.48%), BABA +5.74, BIDU +2.98, BA -6.33, CAT +2.71, DIS +2.60 and XLK $89.10 +3.71 (4.34%).\n  \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -1.73, JPM -2.36, BAC -.14, MS +.29, C -1.53, PNC -1.46, AIG +.15, TRV +3.57, AXP -1.94, and XLF $22.75 +.22 (.98%).\n \nOIL, $20.11 -2.30.

Tonight, it is up $ .75.  Tonight\u2019s closing comment on the front page discusses this situation and the position we took in SCO.  Stocks were lower with the XLE $38.80 unchanged.

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading April 13th\n \n \nStocks Rally, Again\n \nOil Fails on Cutbacks\n \n \nToday was another day in which the market rallied on bad news.  First time unemployment claims were 6.6 million vs the 5 million expectations, a big number by itself.  The FED hit the market with it\u2019s announcement of a new $2.3 TRILLION of emergency lending to businesses and municipalities.  The UK announced its plan to fund their fiscal needs and in Germany, Merkel rejected the Italians demand for a joint euro debt deal.  U. of Michigan Consumer Sentiment fell sharply to 71 vs. 89 in March and the consensus of 79.3.  The DJIA finished +285.80 (1.22%), NASDAQ +62.68 (.77%), S&amp;P 500 +39.84 (1.45%) the Russell again beat all others at +55.06 (4.62%) while the DJ Transports were +84.53 (1.04%).  Market internals were 5.5:1 on NYSE and 3:1 NASDAQ.  Volume was light again, but on a pre-holiday trading day that\u2019s par for the course.  Financials, real estate and Industrials were strong and Health care, technology and communication services weak.  DJIA were 19 up and 11 lower with no triple-digit gainers or losers.  JPM +58, GS +50, HD +49, and MCD +42 DPs, while UNH -22, jnj -14 and INTC -13 DPs.  \nTonight\u2019s Closing Commentary is available https://youtu.be/O7pZP678FZs\n \nThere was also an excellent interview on CNBC HalfTime with Chamath Palihapitiya about bailouts and the American public that I\u2019ve added.  I think it\u2019s especially interesting given that he is not a politician, but rather a venture capitalist.  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/chamath-palihapitiya-us-needs-to-let-hedge-funds-billionaires-fail.html\nBesides this portion of the interview Chamath discusses that if the government wants to help \u201cpeople\u201d and make them even, they should take their last years W2 and pay them monthly what they earned last year and not to support the banks by taking illiquid assets off their balance sheets.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

Later in the day the WSJ reported that the cuts were not as reported and involved cuts of only half that and only for a limited period of time.

        "selftext": "For Trading April 30th\n \n \nOIL Moves Higher\n \nGOOGL, TSLA, &amp; MSFT Blow Away Numbers\n \nRussell the Big Winner\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a dramatic start when already +200 in the futures, GILD came out with positive news on the NIAID trial for Remdesivir and we added an additional 250 to the open.  The Fed FOMC was a nonevent, but after the Q&amp;A, it became obvious that the money train would keep rolling, the Gold moved higher. The final numbers were impressive with DJIA +532.31 (2.21%), NASDAQ +306.98 (3.57%), S&amp;P 500 +76.12 (2.66%), the Russell, the big winner +62.68 (4.83%) and the DJ Transports +221.30 (2.63%).  Market internals were strong with NYSE 7:1 and NASDAQ 4:1 and for the first time in recent memory, volume was higher.  The DJIA was 24:6 with WMT the only double-digit loser -30 DPs while on the upside we had V +72, AAPL +62, AXP &amp; BA +53, and MSFT +52 (and more coming in the morning).\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/el59hhpILHY\n \n \nSECTORS: Earnings played a big part in today\u2019s market.  After the close last night, we heard from Google and it was a beat on revenues and after closing $1232.59 -38.27 and finished the evening $1267 +35.  It continued higher today and finished $1345.02 +112.43 (9.12%).  After today\u2019s close we heard from a few of the other FAANG names.  FaceBook was a miss both top and bottom but the guidance they gave on ad spending was upbeat.  After closing 194.19 +11.28 it to 214.57 + another $20.  MSFT beat on both numbers and after closing $177.43 +7.62 it shot higher to 186.52 before closing $181.25 + 3.82.  TSLA was the last one to report and the stock has been on a tear from a low of $350 in mid-March to close today $800.51 +31.39 and put out a profitable quarter and talked about it big truck.  The stock moved to $886.89 and closed $870.30 for a total gain of $101.88 (13.25%).\n \nAnd, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY is clearly Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR)  reported that it had a 100% survival of its patients treated with CAP-1002.  All were in deep respiratory distress and 5 of the 6 were on ventilators.  Four of the six have already been discharged.  The stock, which has been reversed twice, most recently 1:10, and the last time 1:50 finished the day $8.50 +6.09 (252.7%) Clearly a home run.  But with a side note since the adjusted high after both reverses is $2,720.  Quite a destroyer of equity.\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was LOWER with TSN +.74, BGS -.75, FLO -.47, CAG -.19, MDLZ -.55, KHC +.81, CALM -.79, JJSF +10.71 (8.48%), SAFM -3.43, and LANC +3.09.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB -.46, ABBV +1.20, REGN -17.26 (3.27%), ISRG +16.27 (3.23%), GILD +6.37, MYL +1.06, TEVA +.36, VRTX +1.54, BHC +.95, INCY -1.71, ICPT +1.07, LABU +1.36, and IBB $126.55 +1.74 (1.39%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.18, CGC +.46, CRON +.06, GWPH -.18, ACB +.01, PYX +.03, NBEV +.03, CURLF +.30 (6.67%), KERN -.21 and MJ $12.44 +.18 (1.47%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +8.17, RTX +3.39, GD +.71, TXT +1.48, NOC -12.70, BWXT -.07, TDY +12.71 and ITA $161.85 +7.91 (5.14%).\n \nRETAIL was HIGHER with WMT the big loser again -3.89 (3.04%), M +.26, JWN -.02, KSS +.66, DDS -.45, JCP -.017, TGT +.85, TJX +4.90 (9.98%), RL +2.53, UAA +.19, LULU +7.96, TPPR +1.24 (7.7%), CPRI +1.68 (11.17%), and XRT $37.92 +1.10 (2.99%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +112.43 (9.12%), AMZN +104.12 (4.5%), AAPL +13.72 (4.92%), FB +31.66 (17.31%), NFLX +8.68, NVDA +9.44, TSLA +101.80 (13.25%), BABA +7.15, BIDU +3.12, CMG +26.64, BA +9.65, CAT +5.28, DIS +6.51 (6.13%) and XLK $93.45 +5.25 (5.95%).\n  \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS 5.49, JPM +3.71, BAC +1.31, MS +1.43, C +4.04 (8.56%), PNC +5.00, AIG +2.52 (9.97%), TRV +1.72, AXP +9.16 (10.39%), V +13.74 (8.02%) and XLF $23.38 +.66 (2.9%).\n \nOIL, $15.06 +2.72. Oil was higher again today and seems to be making a decent show of making an important bottom. Tonight, it is higher again trading 15.95 +.89.  The stocks were also much higher with gains of between 6% on the big names and as much as 30% on some of the small ones.  XLE closed $39.95 +3.77 (5.63%).\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,713.40 -8.80. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We have spent the last 3 days consolidating the gains and hit $1,720 today.  I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 yesterday I was a buyer.  We took the downside move this morning and averaged down @ $1.06, and they closed $1.61.  We are also long NEM.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $8825 +1045. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was a continuing move higher.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.60 +1.20 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

While the DJIA was +39.44 (.17%), the only other gainer was the Russell +12.54 (1.04%) with NASDAQ -.63 (.01%) and S&amp;P 500 -1.51 (.05%).  The DJ Transports were + 39.44 (.17%), but also near the lows.  Market internals were positive at 1:6:1 on NYSE and 5:3 on NASDAQ.  Volume was in line with the past several days.  Energy, industrials and communication services were strong and consumer staples, real estate and utilities were the weak sisters.  The DJIA was 15 down, 14 up and PG unchanged.  The big losers were MCD -31 and WMT \u2013 21DPs with UNH +55 and BA +20 DPs.

Gilead (GILD) was lower after trading $84.00 earlier in the day, and the World Health Org (WHO) mistakenly published a report that the trial in China was ended and the drug, Remdesivir, was a flop.  It immediately fell to -6.2 and was halted at 12:46 for volatility.  After hitting 74.40 it moved back to close $77.78 -3.53 (4.34%).  ZM had a solid day on the news that it had reached 300MM users.  Zoom closed at another new high at $169.09 +18.84 (12.54%).  Last, Google reported after hours that they were slashing their marketing budget by 50% in the 2nd half of the year.

Based on news of re-openings in Italy and France in the works and the restarting of repair work on Notre Dame Cathedral were highlights.  Around 11:30 we had a small selloff that lasted until 1:45 and we lost about 100 DPs but we rallied again making a new high of the day at +428 before closing +358.51 (1.51%), NASDAQ +95.64 (1.11%), S&amp;P 500 +41.74 (1.47%) and the Russell, the big winner, +48.82 (3.96%) and DJ Transports +225.02 (2.78%).

I think we may be playing catch-up with today\u2019s move, and we are pretty overextended at this point.  I am also adding a sector for food supply chain companies.  It is clear that the food supply has problems and since there is no ETF that I know of that covers it, I have put together a short list of the big names.

This is the 4th time that they have made changes with this ETF.  From my way of thinking, this will only make it less in line with the actual market moves.

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading April 9th\n \n \nStocks Rally Again\nOil Rebounds\nOPEC MEETING TOMORROW\n \n \nToday was not as exhausting as the last several triple-digit days.  We started slowly +250 on overnight futures rally on some hopeful Covid-19 numbers and after trying the downside to +40, we started the grind higher with lots of little false breaks and a running consolidation from 12:00 to about 2:15 when Bernie said he was \u201csuspending\u201d his campaign.  We rallied to the highs and although the DKIA didn\u2019t quite reach yesterday\u2019s high it did close +779.71 (3.44%) with NASDAQ FOLLOWING A SIMILAR PATTERN AND +2.03.64 (2.58%), S&amp;P 500 +90.57 (3.41%) and the big gainer for the day the Russell +52.49 (4.61%), while DJ Transports managing +286.90 (3.65%).  Market internals were stronger than yesterday with NYSE 8:1 and NASDAQ 5:1, but volume fell on the rally again.  The DJIA was better at 27:3 with one triple-digit gainer in UNH +135 DPs and all the losers just single-digits.  The lack of volume is concerning, but the market keeps marching higher.  The flood of money from the Fed has to go somewhere, and it seems to be finding a home at some of the perceived bargains.  This is the link for tonight\u2019s closing commentary:  https://youtu.be/M3Te_GmNWZk\nAll 11 Sectors of S&amp;P were higher on optimistic expectations about reopening of the economy while World Trade Organization said expectations for global GDP dropping 2.5%-8.8%.  Energy was strong again as were technology real estate and consumer discretionary while healthcare and consumer staples were weak.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1400 members.\n \n \nSECTORS: There was plenty of action early with a Muddy Waters (shorts) did a writeup on EHealth (EHTH) talking about revenue recognition and their \u201cchurn\u201d of accounts.  The story is available at  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/carson-blocks-muddy-waters-takes-short-position-in-ehealth.html and the stock reacted immediately trading down to $93.06 \u2013 23.84 before recovering to close $103.20 -13.70 (11.72%).  In fact, the stock was already feeling the negative effect yesterday when it closed 11.90 -13.67.  Also on the downside was TAL Education (TAL) which announced some \u201cemployee wrongdoing\u201d last night and is being investigated by several law firms, and fell to $50.20 before closing $52.06 -3.76 (6.74%).  On the upside we had OSTK closed $6.82 +1.49 (27.95%) on the news that the SEC is issuing an Ex-div. date for it\u2019s \u201cinnovative, digital dividend.\u201d  I haven\u2019t quite figured out how this works, but it looks like a 1:10 ratio, meaning 1 new share for every 10 owned, and the Pfd. Share are selling for $10.00 currently.  To me that seems like a $1.00 dividend on what was a 5.33 stock at yesterday\u2019s close.  This stock has had a seriously checkered past and a \u201ccrazy CEO and founder.\u201d  The shares rose from $14 to $30 last fall and then collapsed to trade $2.57 last month.  \n \nAnd, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY  was an easy call, Moleculin Biotech (MBRX) reported that their WP1 122 compound, in a study at the University of Frankfort, reported that \u201cit inhibits glycolysis with non-toxic concentrations of 2-DG completely prevented the SARS-CoV-2 cells.\u201d  The stock, down from an all-time high of $8.99 (but no reverse splits) and traded as low as $ .32 last month traded as high as $1.97 before closing $1.27 +.71 (126.79%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +15.74 (5.23%), ABBV +3.45, REGN +10.82, ISRG +20.51 (4.19%), MYL +.93 (6.47%), TEVA +.39, VRTX +1.99.

The explosive moves in Oil recently has seemed to run its course and yesterday\u2019s drop cut the gains by a touch more than half.  Today, however, after bouncing from -$2.00 overnight it rallied to close near the highs on expectations of a deal between Russia and the Saudi\u2019s.  There is also a virtual meeting of OPEC tomorrow.  The stocks were all higher with XLE $34.95 +2.87 (8.95%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,684.30 +.60. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1742 before falling back to close $60 off the highs and below $1700.  Today was a short-range \u201cinside\u201d day I would be a buyer a bit lower than today\u2019s close.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,335 + 5. After we traded in a short-range day followed by a $1,000 range on Friday BTC closed above $7,000 for the first time since it broke to the downside early last month.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.86 +.20 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading April 14th\n \n \nStocks Decline, Finally\n \nOil Fails Again on Cutbacks\n \n \nToday was a down day from the beginning and I\u2019m trying to get this done by starting early since we\u2019ve already lost power once from the storms that decimated the southeast yesterday.  To begin, the DJIA was weak from the start and a downgrade on CAT by Bank America.  That sent the Dow lower than the other indexes and currently we are down just under 2% while NASDAQ is the strength with AZMN, TSLA, and NFLX the leaders, and S&amp;P 500 following the DJIA but only 1.4%.  Well, the power came back on and I\u2019ll do this as fast as possible because the storm is going to last a few hours.  DJIA -328.60 (1.39%, NASDAQ +38.84 (.48%), S&amp;P 500 -28.19 (1.01%), the big loser was the Russell -34.68 (2.78%) and the DJ Transports -201.34 (2.44%).  The big loser was CAT leading the DJIA -71 DPs and no triple-digits and the totals with 21 down and 9 higher, led by AAPL +36 DPs.  The big gainers were the FAANG, listed below in Sectors.  Market internals were in line with the loss with A/D 3:1 on NYSE and 3:2 on NASDAQ.  Volume was light again and consumer discretionary strong and real estate and financials weak.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1800 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nSECTORS:  On the \u201cI have no idea this was going on\u201d group there were 2 big winners today.  One I mentioned earlier was Independence Contract Drilling (ICD) on Thursday finished $6.25 +3.85 (160%), finished today $12.93 +6.68 (106%) on essentially no news except the \u201ctrade halted, trade resumed.\u201d\n\n \n\nBut the HOMERUN OF THE DAY was SCWorx (WORX) on the news that it got a 48 million COVID-19 Rapid Testing units over the next 24 weeks.  I mentioned it in our Discord room this morning when it had a high of $9.95 and was trading around $6.25, but that was just the beginning.  By the end of the day it had traded $14.88 and finished the day $12.02 +9.77 (434.22%).  Not bad, definitely a HR.\n\n  \n\nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +1.89, ABBV +.85, REGN +4.06, ISRG -9.26, MYL -.02, TEVA +.19, VRTX +5.67, BHC -.17, INCY +1.20, ICPT +.09, LABU +.02 and IBB $114.49 +.52 (.46%).\n\n \n\nCANNABIS: This group was MIXED with TLRY -.28, CGC +.01, CRON -.01, GWPH +1.22, ACB -.10, PYX +.03, NBEV -.15, CURLF -.15, KERN +.73 (10.8%), and MJ $11.45 unchanged.\n \n \nDEFENSE: was LOWER with LMT -1.06, RTX -2.71, GD -3.11, TXT -1.14, NOC +2.20, BWXT -.93, TDY -8.82, and ITA $150.63 -4.86 (3.13%).\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M -.52, JWN -.96, KSS -1.11, DDS -2.25, JCP -.02, WMT +3.44, TGT +1.12, TJX -.81, RL -4.46 (5.55%), UAA -.58 (5.56%), LULU -4.24, TPR -.90, CPRI -.24 and XRT $33.28 -.27 (.80%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with several big moves vs. the overall market, with GOOGL +3.84, AMZN +132.24 (6.47%), AAPL +5.26, FB -.12, NFLX +28.36 (7.65%), NVDA +7.41, TSLA +96.02 (16.76%), BABA =3.07, BIDU -.30, BA -3.72, CAT biggest loser in the Dow -10.58 (8.46%), DIS -1.18, and XLK $85.50 +.30 (.35%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -4.76, JPM -4.16, BAC -.84, MS -1.49, C -.56, PNC -4.23, AIG -.82, TRV -3.32, AXP -4.03 and XLF $22.49 -.89 (3.81%).\n \n \nOIL, $22.41 -.35. Oil started last night with a 5-minute bar that started with the open @ 24.74 +2.00 and within that first 5-minutes made the high $24.74 and made the low of the day $22.03.  The move at the open was influenced by the supposed deal to cut production, but quickly fell away.  After an attempt at 24.57 failed we worked lower and a final try in the afternoon at$24.00 it fell back to finish down on the day.  Stocks were mixed to lower with the XLE $38.88 -.03 (.09%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,761.40 + 8.60. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1772 today. Today was a major move to the upside and the close is the highest since September 2012 and sets up a move towards the highs at $1,800 from 2011.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $6810 -480. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we\u2019d have to test 67.50 and today we hit 6550 before turning back up.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.27 -.53 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "For Trading April 22nd\n \n \nOIL GOES LOWER, AGAIN!\n \nStock Pullback Continues\n \nSeveral Solid Earnings Surprises\n \n \nIt\u2019s impossible to start this with anything other than the fact that Oil futures for May, expired today @ 2:30, and the new month, June continued to fall anyway.  This put the current delivery as low as $6.50 then doubling to move back and closing $11.57 -8.86. The oil market seems to be the \u201ctail wagging the dog\u201d these days putting the financials back on their heels. DJIA -631.56 (2.67%), NASDAQ -297.50 (3.48%), S&amp;P 500 -86.60 (3.07%), the Russell -28.26 (2.33%) and the DJ Transports -125 36 (1.57%). Market internals were weak with NYSE A/D 4:1 and NASDAQ 3:1 lower and the volume was a bit light. DJIA was 29 down and TRV unchanged after being lower last night on earnings. Strength was only relative with energy, utilities, and real estate down the least and information technology the weakest. The weakest stocks were AAPL -58 DPs, UNH -54, MSFT -49, GS -45, HD -37, CAT -31 and MRK -30 DPs.

The stock rallied up to $485 but fell back and is currently about unchanged @ $433. Next was TXN with beats both top and bottom lines and after closing 106.84 -4.69 (4.2%) it rallied to $112.23 and is $109 now. SNAP was a surprise with a slight beat on revenues and a small miss  (.08) vs (.07) expected, but the average daily users beat by 5 million and the stock jumped from a $12.44 close to trade $15.12 and is $14.86 +2.42 (20%).  Chipotle: CMG reported a beat @$3.08 vs. 2.90 expected with a minor revenue miss, but strong growth in digital business. As anecdotal evidence, we are eating it more often, ordering it online and using \u201ccontactless delivery.

Oil was the BIGGEST STORY of the day again with the May expiring this afternoon, almost $50 over yesterday\u2019s low. June is the new forward month and it followed the May contract down, trading as low as $6.50 but bouncing back and it is trading about $13.50 in tonight\u2019s session.
