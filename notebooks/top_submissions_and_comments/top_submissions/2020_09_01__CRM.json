        "selftext": "Coda code of conduct\n\n1)\tBuy calls on the best companies in the world 5-10% OTM six months or more until expiration.  FAANG, MSFT, TSLA, NIKE, WMT, JPM, PYPL, AXP, BABA, NVDA, AMD, SBUX, CRM.  Or ETF\u2019s like MGK, FNGS, and SOXX if you don\u2019t have the capital to get in on single equity options.\n\n2)\tHold for at least half of the 6 months until expiration.  \n\n3)\tThe long term goal is to buy and hold shares.  This is what rich people do.  Hard assets that can\u2019t quickly evaporate like options can.  Same choice of companies as above.  Just the good shit. Hold assets that slowly grow. Cash gang = chicken coop.\n\n4)\tIn order to protect your winnings, make sure half of your account is shares.  \n\n5)\tUse margin sparingly.  Less than half of what they are offering you.\n\n6)\tIf you need to do a weekly just to have a little casino thrill in your life it should be less than a grand.  Weeklies are not how real wealth is built.  But it\u2019s ok if you see a strong trend but don\u2019t YOLO your whole stack.  That\u2019s just dumb.\n\n7)\tSmoke weed every day.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSee, I got up to six figures buying puts in mid-march. But then I lost like 3/4\u2019s of my stack staying short when the market bottomed on March 23rd.  So I needed to come up with a system to protect my gains.  Hence, the Coda code of conduct.\n\nFor example, I started with $75k but now I have around $162k in shares.  So, no matter what happens I\u2019ll likely be ahead of where I started.  I\u2019m slightly out of balance because I have more options than shares.  $196k in calls vs $162k in shares.  So I\u2019m like $34k out of balance, somewhat breaking my own rule.  So I\u2019m living a little dangerously until 9/18 at which time I\u2019m going to execute 4 apple calls and 2 msft calls.  Which will bring my share total up like $65k.  I might have to sell some options so I have the buying power in my account to get this done.  At that point, I will have more shares than options so I\u2019ll be green lit to buy more calls.  This is how I enforce discipline on myself to not get to overextended.  Leverage, but not too much leverage.  Good luck to us all!",

        "selftext": "Snowflake (SNOW) will go public today. The data warehousing company will be the biggest IPO of the year and it has gotten a lot of attention lately. Salesforce and even Berkshire Hathaway will both be buying 3.1 million stocks, good for $500,000,000 in total. They got to buy them for $80 per share.\n\nThis week, the company's underwriters have upped the price range from $75-$85 to $100-$110, which is an increase of 31% due to greater demand. They then decided that this was still not good enough so the stock will go public at $120 per share.\n\nCan this be justified? Maybe. Their revenue increased with 130% in the first half of the year yoy. They're on track to bring in $500 mln in revenue this year. We all know that investors get really excited by cloud companies and pay a hefty premium for them, because they keep generating revenue during lockdowns and high growth rates are expected to continue over the coming years.\n\nNow, here's the quote we've all been waiting for:\n\n\"For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.\"\n\nThe irony is that Buffet himself is involved in this highly priced IPO. Yes, we all know that the company will probably do great over the next few years. The data warehousing industry will have a size of around $35 bln in 2025. That's just a little bigger than the current market cap of Snowflake($33.3 bln). Last February, they were only valued at $12.7 bln, and with a P/S ratio of 50, the stock is more expensive than Zoom. What you really should be asking yourself is: how much of their expected growth is already priced in? Are you willing to pay 50% more than that institutional parties had to?\n\nI'm not saying whether to buy in or not, I just wanted to give this piece of advice by the Oracle to you. Never buy out of FOMO and good luck investing y'all.",

        "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than than.  Several people suggested that it be \"pinned.\"  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**EEM** \\- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.\n\n**EFA** \\- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.\n\n**S*****ector fund ETFs:***\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. **ICLN** is more broad while **TAN** focuses more specifically on solar energy and **FAN** specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of **QQQ** and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. **QCLN** and **PBW** are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** **group of funds:**  **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* **ARKG** \\- Genomic Revolution\n* **ARKF** \\- Fintech\n* **ARKK** \\- Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* **ARKW** \\- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)\n* **ARKQ** \\- Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* **PRNT** \\- 3D printing technology\n* **IZRL** \\- disruptive companies based in Israel\n\n**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLI** \\- Industrial\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLP** \\- Consumer Staples\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLRE** \\- Real Estate\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n* **XLE** \\- Energy/Oil\n\n**Cloud Computing** is another sector to consider. Some tickers in that sector include: **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\n***Other sector funds include:***\n\n**Health Care:** FHLC, VHT, IYH\n\n**Utilities:** IDU, VPU, FUTY, RYU\n\n**Oil/Energy:** IYE, FENY, VDE\n\n**Consumer Staples:** FSTA, VDC, IECS\n\n**Real Estate:** ICF, USRT, VNQ, PSR, BBRE\n\n**Media/Entertainment:** IEME, PBS, PEJ, IYC\n\n**Gaming/Casinos:** BJK, BETZ, CARZ\n\n**Transportation (including airlines):** JETS, XTN, FTXR, VIS\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n**20%** \\- Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n**20%** \\- VXUS or one of the other International ETFs\n\n**20%** \\- IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n**10%** **each** in four sector funds of your choice\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person. I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*",

        "selftext": "Palantir hits the public markets via a direct listing on September 23. The big  data analytics and visualization company is best known for its work with  the US Government, and prior to this week, there had been speculation  that it could be the largest tech company to go public this year.  However according to its recently amended S-1, the company could now be  valued at just over $10bn \u2013 down from a private market valuation of  $20.4bn after a December 2015 funding round.\n\nThis comes after Reuters reported last week that Palantir was pursuing a  valuation between $26bn to $30bn during a recent private equity raise.  While the private market transaction prices have varied, if the average  share price is accurate, the number of present shares outstanding points  to a significant depreciation in the valuation of the company.\n\nInsiders sold Palantir shares even though revenues rose from $595mn in 2018 to  around $742mn in 2019. And on the back of accelerated top line growth,  the company expects to surpass $1bn in sales this year for the first  time \u2013 though there was probably a temporary demand boost related to  requirements to analyze COVID data. So why has private equity soured on  the company and [how might that affect the opportunity for retail investors once shares become publicly available in two weeks](https://blackjacketco.com/f/market-snapshot-looking-at-palantir-ahead-of-public-listing)?\n\n**Losses**\n\n* Palantir has been around for 17 years and has yet to display any meaningful  progress towards profitability despite a comparatively more favorable  competitive landscape in years past. Last year, the company lost $580mn  on sales of $742mn \u2013 or a net loss percentage of 78%. While that figure  is high, this marks an improvement over the prior year when losses  exceeded revenues.\n* The  company only spent 5% of 2019 revenues on sales and marketing. With the  need to invest heavily in its salesforce in coming quarters as the  company more aggressively pursues corporate customers, that figure is  likely to rise significantly \u2013 further weighing on profitability.\n\n**Business Mix**\n\n* In 2019, 46.4% of Palantir revenues came from government contracts and 95%  of revenue came from existing customers. The exposure to various US  government agencies provides a certain amount of near-term revenue  stability. However, the public sector segment of the business is also  more subject to growth ceilings as increased spend on Palantir services  is directly tied to defense funding.\n* And in the current fiscal and political environment, significant continued  increases to the defense budget as seen recently is far from certain.  Therefore, Palantir will likely need to greatly expand its commercial  customer base to sustain the type of growth experienced over the past 3  years.\n\n**Competition**\n\n* Palantir has been around about the same time as other peer data analytics and  visualization companies such as Splunk and Tableau yet generates  significantly lesser revenue ($2.36bn for Splunk for FY20 and $1.16bn  for Tableau in 2018) and weaker margins. For FY20 Q2, Palantir gross  margins hit 73%. Prior to its acquisition by Salesforce, Tableau gross  margins were 87%. And Splunk gross margins hover around 80%.\n* Technology and financial media reported as far back as 2014 that Palantir was  projected to cross the $1bn revenue mark, but the company is only going  to reach that milestone this year. As Palantir pushes more into the  territory of traditional commercial-oriented big data players, the  company may see short-term revenue pressures in adopting a  subscription-based sales approach that is more popular with customers in  the enterprise end market.\n\n**Governance**\n\n* Investors buying into Palantir shares should be aware that the company is not  going to deliver independent governance for up to a year, including both  its board and audit committee. On top of this, Palantir chairman Peter  Thiel and co-founders Stephen Cohen and Alex Karp will control 49.99% of  voting shares for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d according to the updated  S-1.\n* In  some circumstances, the company notes that total voting power may  exceed 49.99%. The threshold under NYSE regulations for a \u201ccontrolled  company\u201d is 50%, so in effect Palantir is likely to become a controlled  company at some point leaving individual investors with no say in how  the company is run.\n\n**Takeaway**\n\n* Palantir is one of the original and most well-known unicorns and has garnered  significant attention heading into its direct listing. Although the  company has achieved impressive revenue growth over the past several  years, the combination of increased insider selling ahead of the  listing, sustained net losses above 50% of revenues, and growing  competition for large commercial customers leaves shares subject to a  range of near-term headwinds.\n* With a price-to-sales multiple (estimated near 10X) far lower than other  high-growth software stocks, Palantir is better evaluated for present  value versus future growth. Because of these factors, patient investors  interested in the stock will likely get a lower entry point to initiate a  long-term position.\n\n*You can also find me on Twitter* [*@BlackjacketCo*](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about stock ideas, emerging technologies, and long-term market trends.

        "selftext": "With TSLA bout to open in Correction Territory, the paper hands gang is off longing $ROPE and the Gay Bears are busy crying tears of joy into their wives' titties cause its the first time they've seen those funbags in years.  So I'm pretty sure the only people reading this are my fellow Papa Musk Cultist who can now say Buy The Dip easier than they can breath.\n\nWhile the naysayers are distracted, I got some news for you.  This correction is ***the last stop before this rocket heads to mars.***  What's that?  You've heard this song before?  Nah... not like this.  Let me show you.\n\nSo the selloff first started when TSLA announced a 5B$ Capitol Raise.  They about to dump shares to raise money.  Makes sense right?  If TSLA themselves is cashing in, why shouldn't we.\n\n[cause that shit is optional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh4TsZRzSEs)\n\nTSLA didn't dump 5B worth of shares Tuesday at the open.  Nah, Papa Elon is one of us.  He just filed BDE paper work that says \"You'll sell when TSLA wants, if TSLA wants, at the price TSLA wants\".  Now to be fair, TSLA absolutely will make good on this.  It's no secret at this point that the money will ensure their balance sheet/cash flow/fundamentals are squeaky clean ahead of SP inclusion, which is inevitable now that [salesforce just kicked Exxon out of the DOW](https://borneobulletin.com.bn/2020/08/reshuffling-the-dow-exxon-out-salesforce-in/).  Elon wants to see the SEC cry.\n\nBut what about other investors?  The selloff turned ugly when Wednesday morning, it was announced that a massive investor dumped their position.  I guess they wanted to take profits like TSLA right?\n\n[Nope, they sold because TSLA was literally too good](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/02/teslas-largest-outside-shareholder-reduces-holding-citing-portfolio-restrictions.html)\n\nTSLA shot up so fast that this firm was forced to reduce its position because TSLA became an \"outsized influence on the firm's holdings\".  In plain english: TSLA was doing better than the entire rest of the portfolio and it freaked out the risk team at the firm.  Bless their boomer hearts.  The firm still plans to hold as much TSLA as they possibly can which is about as bullish as you can get.\n\nBut this is where it gets juicy.  I think many of you autists know that the Market loves to fuck you.  And their ain't no better way to fuck than doggy.\n\nThat's why she loves making you look at something shiny on CNBC when the real shit is about to bend you over from behind.\n\nWell this idiot turned around and you know what I saw?\n\n[The Lucid Air](https://electrek.co/2020/09/02/lucid-air-beats-tesla-model-s-9-second-quarter-mile/)  \nWith its  [record setting battery range](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/the-all-electric-lucid-air-gets-an-estimated-epa-range-of-517-miles/) of 517 miles.  \nDebuting on [September 9th](https://www.lucidmotors.com/stories/lucid-air-production-reveal)\n\nThis retard firmly believes MM's are dumping because they think when the Air is revealed, it will confirm the record shattering 517 mile range estimate and that will totally deflate TSLA.  Battery day will be playing catchup and the entire idea that Elon has this massive head start will go right out the window.\n\nAnd that would warrant a massive correction.  Here is the Catch.\n\nThe 517 Mile Range is [Not Confirmed by the EPA themselves](https://insideevs.com/reviews/438723/lucid-air-tesla-model-s-porsche-taycan-range/).  The Estimate comes from 3rd party testing.\n\nAnd when Porsche got a Third Party to give them an EPA estimate for the Taycan, [they overshot it by 40%](https://amcitesting.com/taycan/).\n\nSo in summary: I believe the correction is happening because investors think the Lucid Air is going to come out and totally wipe away Elon's \"it\" factor when some no-name startup overtakes them in battery tech.  I believe they are wrong and when the real EPA gives the Air a range around 300 miles, there is going to be a mad dash back to TSLA ahead of Battery day... and then its Q3 Earnings, SP Inclusion, Cyber Truck and Semi Sales beginning, potential of a TSLA Plane, and oh look when did TSLA go back to 2000?\n\nAlso Lucid is owned by [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Motors).  GO AMERICA!\n\nPeace!",

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm relatively new to this sub, and I don't know jack shit about trading options, shorting, or margins, but after seeing your shitposts, I'm going to teach you how to build a real retirement portfolio after you YOLO all your gains and are ready for big boy pants. The strategy I've used has allowed me to consistently outperform all indexes, even NASDAQ in recent years (100% gain over past two years, never underperformed). As it relates to building wealth over the long haul there's only one true piece of advice that I have in common with you shits and that's that stonks only go up.\n\nI'm the head of engineering at our tech company so I\u2019m pretty familiar with the software industry. My strategy is to combine my domain expertise with buy and hold. I dollar cost average into all my positions, and I\u2019m particularly greedy when the market is down. Because my domain expertise is mostly in tech, this generally leaves me over-exposed in that sector. I try to combat against that by buying in some tech-adjacent companies on the consumer side. \n\nFor example, I am in an industry similar to Square and Shopify, they\u2019re our top competitors, so I buy them. I\u2019m intimate with the makeup of their portfolios, market positioning, and growth opportunities.\n\nWe chose Zoom and Slack at work, and as I use it extensively and have evaluated the competition as part of our vendor selection process, I can argue that they\u2019re the market leaders in what they do and I understand their pricing models. To dive deeper in this, I also know how much we pay and how much more we would be willing to pay (I make the final decision generally), and I can tell you that these companies haven\u2019t even started cost optimization. There\u2019s a lot of upside after the current high-growth period subsides. Yeah yeah we fucking hate when companies raise prices except when you own the goddamn company. Did you idiots know you can raise prices 10% most of the time and only churn out 2% in the short term? You probably didn't.\n\nYou autists have domain expertise as well, think about what software your company uses at work, do they have a POS? Do they have a CRM that is specific to your industry? Is there an incumbent that is publicly traded and they're kicking your ass? Do you use a lot of social media, are you an influencer? Maybe you know about the next big social network, or maybe you know that FB isn't going away anytime soon... you guys know shit and don't even realize it.\n\nAlso, as I stated earlier, my attempt to diversify is by moving into things that are adjacent to my domain expertise which happens to be software. For example, I own a Tesla and purchase clothes from Stitch Fix, and huge consumer of various Disney products and services. Again, I\u2019ve evaluated competitors, and I use the products personally, and I can also argue that my domain expertise gives me a little more insight than the average person on how well software is executed and how much enterprise value that brings the company through innovations such as auto-pilot and the UI/UX of their mobile apps, etc...\n\nI kinda look at PE but mostly just check revenue growth as a lot of the stocks I buy are from companies that aren't yet profitable.\n\nAnd yeah I fucking bought Apple, and Amazon before it was cool.\n\nAfter picking the stocks I don\u2019t go all in. I buy one share or add it to the watch list (dependent upon which brokerage app I use) so I get sense of where it was at a point in time, and by looking each day alongside the rest of my portfolio I get a sense of how it\u2019s changed over time and how they react in relation to my existing portfolio. Then if it dips or goes sideways for a bit, I\u2019ll average in, and then repeat until that stock rises about mid-way in my portfolio by value, then I hold my position there. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t sell, I don\u2019t care what happens I laugh at 30% dips and buy more maybe. I just don\u2019t do it UNLESS the stock moons, then I try to sell so one stock doesn\u2019t get too far ahead so I have enough dry powder for more positions. It doesn\u2019t work all the time, sometimes you get something like Google and it just kinda sits there, but over the long haul, it works 9 times out of 10. \n\nYou can google them but there are studies that show definitively you almost have to try to fail at buy and hold, over periods of 10 years or more , it\u2019s almost impossible as long as you\u2019re not overexposed in two or three companies. People who bought before the dot com bust, or just before the housing bubble, they\u2019re multiples higher today than where they were.\n\nfuck you guys, I know somehow I'm going to get shit for this post but I think I'm starting to like it here.\n\nyah I know proof or ban, here's one of my retirement accounts: https://imgur.com/a/VaoT0t4\n\nTLDR; Buy companies with good products that you use, average in, hold for years and years, sell bits off when they moon or you're over invested in one stock.",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/15/snowflake-prices-ipo-above-increased-range-implying-initi.html\n\nThe company is on track to book $500M revenue for 2020, implies a 67 multiple in valuation, one of the highest (if not the highest) among public SAAS companies by quite a bit. \n\n\n&gt;Snowflake, a provider of cloud-based data storage and analysis software, priced its IPO above its increased range in an offering that values the company at $33.3 billion.\n\n&gt; Snowflake is selling 28 million shares at $120 a piece, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the pricing hasn\u2019t been made public. The company, which is poised to debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol \u201cSNOW,\u201d is the first of several technology companies to go public this week in one of the busiest stretches of the year. Snowflake will raise approximately $3.4 billion from the offering.\n\n&gt; Investors are bidding up Snowflake\u2019s ahead of the offering as they anticipate a blockbuster opening for a company that\u2019s generating over $500 million in annualized revenue and grew over 130% in the first half of the year. The company had already raised its anticipated debut price range from a maximum of $85 to a max of $110 in the space of less than a week. Snowflake is growing alongside the major public cloud vendors by providing technology that allows clients to quickly analyze and share vast amounts of data and increase capacity as needed, rather than relying on databases that are tied to hardware.\n\n&gt; Last week, Snowflake revealed in a filing that Berkshire Hathaway and Salesforce each agreed to buy $250 million of stock at the IPO price in a concurrent private placement. Berkshire Hathaway also agreed to buy 4.04 million shares in a secondary transaction from former CEO Bob Muglia. Based on the IPO price, Berkshire will be paying $484.8 million for those shares. \n\n&gt; Snowflake is entering a market that\u2019s hungry for high-growth cloud software makers, particularly those that have shown an ability to continue expanding through the coronavirus pandemic. Even after pulling back this month, the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index, consisting of over 50 publicly traded companies, is up about 55% this year, compared to a 25% gain for the Nasdaq and 5.3% advance in the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; Zoom\u2019s stock is up over 500% in 2020, and Fastly has jumped more than 300%. DocuSign, Shopify and Datadog have more than doubled.",

        "selftext": "Like many of you, I lost money, but I also made money\n\nBefore I get into that, let me tell you a story about the last two weeks:\n\nlast week - bunch of retards making the market go parabolic with fomo over aapl and tsla splits\n\nlast week - as spy increased, we saw vix go UP, which generally happens when the market is pricing in a blown off top\n\nmonday of this week - tsla and aapl finally getting corrected, a sigh of relief, but wait, vix is still going up, hmm, thats not good\n\nwednesday of this week - very large correction on tsla and aapl, but a minor retrace to end the day. If you were paying attention, you shouldve sold all your shit on this day.\n\nWhy, you may ask? Because of today's timeline\n\n8:00 AM EST - the zoomer coin crashes, whales are pulling out\n\n9:30 AM EST - the FUD from tsla crashing caused all the fomo holders of ARK etfs to sell\n\n9:45 AM EST - bc everyone started selling ARK etfs trying to escape their tsla positions due to already seeing red the previous day, other ARK holdings like square and amazon started crashing as well (which are qqq holdings too).\n\n10:00 AM EST - because everyone started selling qqq holdings, the QQQ holders started selling because they already felt pain from aapl. The central time zone also woke up and started selling QQQ\n\n11:00 AM EST - because QQQ started crashing, SPY holders started getting nervous and selling off. PLUS, california woke up and started selling\n\nNOON EST - it was at this time that the FUD news articles started getting written and the smooth brains started selling off\n\nthe rest of the day proceeded as you would expect\n\non a side note, fuck you cunts who sent tsla and aapl parabolic, youre the reason my ark position is bleeding out of its ass today\n\nanyway, here's whats going to happen. As more and more of the world wakes up to the fact that tech is gonna go down much further, we'll have one more crash day, and most likely two small red days following that\n\nWhat should you do, you might ask?\n\nFirst, lets identify where support is currently. One can do this by looking at stocks like nvda, amzn, googl, fb, crm, tsla, aapl, and identifying where the tech support levels are. Generally this is the point where they were before aapl and tsla fomoers sent them parabolic. Once tech reaches those support levels, the selloff on the broad market will stop, just like the selloff began from the tech market\n\ndo you need to know this support? Not really, because\n\nVXX 35 november calls will still print. You want november expiration so that you wont get iv crushed, since youll get padded with the election FUD.\n\nEven though youre late, you can still make 10-20% gains as the second day of crashing occurs. However, you want to identify the support levels you will close your positions at\n\nand thats it folks, buy volatility, since it will go up.\n\nAlternatively, you could do puts on qqq, but im pretty smooth brained so ive rarely made money on puts, so i just stay away from them",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - September 18, 2020**\n\nStocks dropped again today, closing out a volatile week on a sour note. Tech stocks continued pulling back, with many notable stocks breaking through well-established supports. In spite of the Fed\u2019s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. \n\nThis week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&amp;P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.\n\nAfter a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, \u201cAt this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4\u201d\n\nEconomic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that\u2019s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. \n\nConfidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus.

        "selftext": "TLDR: \nSalesforce (CRM) is the perfect company to buy during a tech bubble and is riding the COVID wave.  Their e-commerce platform, which is has about 3x the market share of the closest CRM competitor, is benefiting from the shift from Brick and Mortar to online sales.  Humana is now using Salesforce to deliver telemedicine.  The recent inclusion of CRM in the Dow is going to force buying.  Salesforce has a tech focused investment fund that is making big tendies.\n\nCRM 1/22/21 250c\n\nImagine the typical Black Friday.  Crowds shoulder to shoulder to get the best deals.  Thanks to COVID that\u2019s not happening this year.  Those sales are shifting online.  Salesforce (CRM) has a 21% share of Customer Relationship Management market, which among other things, is the e-commerce platform for online retailers.  Salesforce is taking a tiny % of online sales from each retailer.  You know there\u2019s going to be a crazy amount of emails sent out this holiday season.  Guess who gets paid based on volume of emails?\n\n\nSalesforce was just added to the Dow.  The Dow is weighted by share price.  As CRM increases, reweighing of the Dow caused forced buying.  \n\nAlso in the same link ATT and PayPal are recent new customers.\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/salesforce-was-just-added-to-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-and-its-q2-update-shows-why\n\nSalesforce (CRM) has a technology focused investment fund.  During a tech bubble, you want to own a basket of smaller tech companies, especially if there\u2019s IPOs and acquisitions.  CRM made a bunch of money from the NCNO and ZM IPOs.\n\n\u201cWe're the leader in cloud computing helping others to become the same. Since 2009, we've funded over 400 entrepreneurs building the next generation of enterprise technology.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.salesforce.com/company/ventures/portfolio/\n\nSalesforce is working with Humana to deliver telemedicine.  COVID has forced doctors and insurance companies to get comfortable with telemedicine.  That should jumpstart the trend going forward.\n\nhttps://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Humana-Selects-Salesforce-to-Deliver-Connected-Personalized-Healthcare/default.aspx\n\nApparently CRM was 1 of 7 tech stocks that were included in a $1 billion option purchase.\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/markets/whats-behind-last-weeks-meltup-vix-citadel-explains\n\nI want to own CRM for the Q3 earnings announcement in December.  E-commerce is having a big quarter.  The internal investment fund should be strong.  Headlines will be full of stories about online retail.  The stock is taking a breather after the huge post earnings run up.  I bought today and intend to hold through Q3 earnings.  During a bubble, I think the market cap could inflate from the current $250 billion to a $1 trillion.",

        "selftext": " **What?** \\- [Snowflake](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/16/snowflake-snow-opening-trading-on-the-nyse.html) began trading yesterday under the ticker: SNOW.\u00a0Shares surged more than 111% on the first day, which makes Snowflake one of the largest tech companies in the world ($70.4 billion). Just this February, the company was \"only\" worth $11.2 billion.\u00a0  \n**Why?**\n\n* Amazing CEO: [Frank Slootman](https://blocksandfiles.com/2019/11/11/frank-slootman-snowflake-computing-interview/) grew Data Domain from 20 employees into a $1 billion a year revenue\u00a0firm that employs thousands. Then he grew ServiceNow from $75 million in annual revenue to $1.5 billion within 6 years.\u00a0\n* Perfect Timing: Covid-19 only accelerated the growth of digital transformation. Snowflake is growing alongside the major public cloud vendors by providing technology that allows clients to quickly analyze and share vast amounts of data and increase capacity as needed, rather than relying on databases that are tied to hardware.\n* Decent Financials: In the first half of 2020, Snowflake grew sales at 130%, widened gross margin to 61.6%, but still lost $171 million.\n* Big Backers: Warren Buffets Berkshire Hathaway, and Marc Benioff Salesforce both have major stakes in the company.\u00a0\n\n**The Takeaway:**\u00a0Snowflake has a lot of things going for it, but that doesn't necessarily make it a great investment. Remember the company is up 628% since February if you factor in its pre-IPO valuation. Even though Warren Buffett is an investor here is some wisdom from the legendary investor regarding IPOs in general:\n\n*\u201cThe idea of saying the best place in the world I could put my money is something where all the selling incentives are there, commissions are higher, the animal spirits are rising, that that\u2019s going to perform better than 1,000 other things I could buy where there is no similar enthusiasm. \u2026 Just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d*\n\nFrom the MarketBites Investment Newsletter Team made with love :)",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: Great long-term growth stock to take advantage of the stay-at-home movement.** \n\nDisclosure: I have a small position in this. I don't necessarily expect much from this earnings report, but I do think it has great **long-term** potential.\n\nCurrently, subscription revenue makes up 83% of total sales (or $50mm in the last quarter). Moreover, the company generates $225mm in recurring revenue (as of 3/31) and they have been growing this out considerably year-over-year. This is important as software companies that have an established source of revenue with sticky customers perform well in the long run. Think of CRM, DOCU as examples. \n\nThe company currently does not make a profit, but again it's a growth stock. They spent $110mm on marketing and R&amp;D in 2019, which is what ate significantly into their GP of $147mm. This makes their net loss of $32 a little more palatable when considering that they would actually be net-positive if they cut marketing and R&amp;D and focused on their current customers that generate mostly recurring revenue. However, they are trying to expand their customer base, so marketing and R&amp;D are needed to do that, but I'm just trying to explain that looking solely at the negative net-profit is not a meaningful analysis. \n\nTo close, this is a tremendous growth company that should benefit from stay-at-home growth over the next few quarters. From 2018 to 2019, they grew their subscription revenue by 60% ($100mm to $160mm). Moreover, their customer base is relatively sticky as Apple devices and devices, in general, last for about 2-3 years (this is my estimate, please don't hold me to this) in a corporate or educational environment. Thus, if schools bought new iPads this summer for the upcoming school year, we're looking at the school district sticking with JAMF's products for the 2-3 year life cycle of the product. With so many schools going online this semester and possibly next semester as well, device management firms like JAMF should benefit from schools providing iPads, Macbooks and other learning devices to their students. \n\nI think the reason the stock price has lagged is that updated financials haven't been published yet, so there is uncertainty regarding the valuation of the company, but this could be a great long-term pick. \n\nSources:    \nS-1 Form: [https://ir.jamf.com/static-files/e6c5aba2-3015-4c97-ba37-6f97d994deba](https://ir.jamf.com/static-files/e6c5aba2-3015-4c97-ba37-6f97d994deba)  \nCompany Website: [https://ir.jamf.com](https://ir.jamf.com/)\n\nApologies for any spelling errors, trying to type this quickly!",

        "selftext": "Snowflake originally said their IPO would be around $75. Then they obviously got the big investors, one being Berkshire and the other being salesforce. Two big boys right? Keep in mind this doesn\u2019t mean warren buffet himself knows shit about this stock or has any clue about the technology behind it. \n\nThese big investments (several hundred million from each of the two entities) caused them to raise their IPO a good bit. As it stands, their profits don\u2019t exactly match the IPO of $100-130 range. If you do get calls, get ready to cash out FAST. Because I can\u2019t predict the future but I am pretty confident it\u2019ll drop before it grows. And it may be too late for you by the time it starts on the uptrend.\n\nI\u2019m in IT, I know how important their service is going to be. It\u2019s going to be crucial. That\u2019s if somebody doesn\u2019t come in and just do it better than they did it. That\u2019s the thing with IT. Snowflake is ahead today, but it isn\u2019t a car company or an energy company. There aren\u2019t hundreds of engineers with secret blueprints behind the project. This is a fundamental technology in IT and someone can easily steal this idea and make it better. Will that happen? Doubtful for the near future. But keep it in mind. \n\nLong term I think you\u2019ll see $SNOW grow. Maybe even in the immediate short term just due to hype. But just keep in mind there\u2019s a damn good chance it\u2019ll go back to what it\u2019s really worth. $75-100. They\u2019re not that profitable right now. So keep in mind that you\u2019re buying calls essentially for a hype train. If you buy stocks then you\u2019re probably good for the long term investment. Calls though are a straight gamble (wow, genius revelation, right???). Maybe the hype is real. Maybe it\u2019ll flop tomorrow. But I\u2019ve seen too many people saying this is the one they YOLO on. \n\nSo, to summarize. $SNOW was originally going to be $75. Now it\u2019s going to be probably $110-130. That\u2019s a huge premium you\u2019re paying for just to be a part of a company that Berkshire and salesforce are backing. Make sure it\u2019s worth it.",

Whether it be tech, post secondary degree people or service workers we are seeing layoffs across the board right now.\n\nWith evictions being postponed until December and nothing getting passed for stimulus, (I can\u2019t speculate on cases up or down because I don\u2019t have the DD on it) it looks like Friday has the possibility to be red. \n\nI can speculate now that if jobs are down and we do have a poor report, Trump will spin it as we are containing the virus which is why we have less people working, but to retroact that we have extended evictions until the end of the year. \n\nWith all of this being said I can say that the trucking and transportation industry is booming with freight being shipped all over and shipping rates are high from so much activity.

        "selftext": "Palantir hits the public markets via a direct listing on September 23. The big data analytics and visualization company is best known for its work with the US Government, and prior to this week, there had been speculation that it could be the largest tech company to go public this year. However according to its recently amended S-1, the company could now be valued at just over $10bn \u2013 down from a private market valuation of $20.4bn after a December 2015 funding round.\n\nThis comes after Reuters reported last week that Palantir was pursuing a valuation between $26bn to $30bn during a recent private equity raise. While the private market transaction prices have varied, if the average share price is accurate, the number of present shares outstanding points to a significant depreciation in the valuation of the company.\n\nInsiders sold Palantir shares even though revenues rose from $595mn in 2018 to around $742mn in 2019. And on the back of accelerated top line growth, the company expects to surpass $1bn in sales this year for the first time \u2013 though there was probably a temporary demand boost related to requirements to analyze COVID data. So why has private equity soured on the company and [how might that affect the opportunity for retail investors once shares become publicly available in two weeks](https://blackjacketco.com/f/market-snapshot-looking-at-palantir-ahead-of-public-listing)?\n\n**Losses**\n\n* Palantir has been around for 17 years and has yet to display any meaningful progress towards profitability despite a comparatively more favorable competitive landscape in years past. Last year, the company lost $580mn on sales of $742mn \u2013 or a net loss percentage of 78%. While that figure is high, this marks an improvement over the prior year when losses exceeded revenues. \n* The company only spent 5% of 2019 revenues on sales and marketing. With the need to invest heavily in its salesforce in coming quarters as the company more aggressively pursues corporate customers, that figure is likely to rise significantly \u2013 further weighing on profitability. \n\n**Business Mix**\n\n* In 2019, 46.4% of Palantir revenues came from government contracts and 95% of revenue came from existing customers. The exposure to various US government agencies provides a certain amount of near-term revenue stability. However, the public sector segment of the business is also more subject to growth ceilings as increased spend on Palantir services is directly tied to defense funding. \n* And in the current fiscal and political environment, significant continued increases to the defense budget as seen recently is far from certain. Therefore, Palantir will likely need to greatly expand its commercial customer base to sustain the type of growth experienced over the past 3 years.\n\n**Competition**\n\n* Palantir has been around about the same time as other peer data analytics and visualization companies such as Splunk and Tableau yet generates significantly lesser revenue ($2.36bn for Splunk for FY20 and $1.16bn for Tableau in 2018) and weaker margins. For FY20 Q2, Palantir gross margins hit 73%. Prior to its acquisition by Salesforce, Tableau gross margins were 87%. And Splunk gross margins hover around 80%. \n* Technology and financial media reported as far back as 2014 that Palantir was projected to cross the $1bn revenue mark, but the company is only going to reach that milestone this year. As Palantir pushes more into the territory of traditional commercial-oriented big data players, the company may see short-term revenue pressures in adopting a subscription-based sales approach that is more popular with customers in the enterprise end market. \n\n**Governance**\n\n* Investors buying into Palantir shares should be aware that the company is not going to deliver independent governance for up to a year, including both its board and audit committee. On top of this, Palantir chairman Peter Thiel and co-founders Stephen Cohen and Alex Karp will control 49.99% of voting shares for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d according to the updated S-1. \n* In some circumstances, the company notes that total voting power may exceed 49.99%. The threshold under NYSE regulations for a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d is 50%, so in effect Palantir is likely to become a controlled company at some point leaving individual investors with no say in how the company is run. \n\n**Takeaway**\n\n* Palantir is one of the original and most well-known unicorns and has garnered significant attention heading into its direct listing. Although the company has achieved impressive revenue growth over the past several years, the combination of increased insider selling ahead of the listing, sustained net losses above 50% of revenues, and growing competition for large commercial customers leaves shares subject to a range of near-term headwinds. \n* With a price-to-sales multiple (estimated near 10X) far lower than other high-growth software stocks, Palantir is better evaluated for present value versus future growth. Because of these factors, patient investors interested in the stock will likely get a lower entry point to initiate a long-term position. \n\n*You can also find me on Twitter* [*@BlackjacketCo*](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about stock ideas, emerging technologies, and long-term market trends.

Haven\u2019t really paid close attention to it before, but it does seem like a somewhat healthy mid-growth (I guess you could say) company. wondering if anyone thinks this is it, or if there is still ample room for it to run. I\u2019d like to hear mostly some really bearish views on it, and of course some bullish views/ rebuttals to the bearish ones. If anyone has the time to break down their opinion it would be greatly appreciated. To my understanding, they are leaders in the SFA space. I was wondering, do they continue to be? Or do they keep making acquisitions, digging into new territories, and take on a heavier load. Is a heavier load (in their case) a bad thing or a good thing? I think it started off as a good thing, but they definitely need to push the breaks a bit here, if they want to keep that nice revenue growth. If anyone wants to chime in and correct me, or offer some of their bull/bear points, would be great. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone. I wrote a follow-up piece to Snowflake's IPO yesterday. I hope this helps, and if you have any insight or feedback to add please drop a comment on the post. TIA!   \n\n\nOriginal Article: [https://stockmarket.com/featured/snowflake-ipo-heres-what-you-need-to-know-before-buying-snow-stock-2020-09-17](https://stockmarket.com/featured/snowflake-ipo-heres-what-you-need-to-know-before-buying-snow-stock-2020-09-17)\n\n## Is SNOW Stock A Ten Bagger Stock In The Making?\n\nCatching snowflakes is an enjoyable experience, but it can also make good money this week. By now we can conclude that 2020 has been a bumper year for [cloud stocks](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing/tech-stocks). Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK.A Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=BRK.A)) and Salesforce ([CRM Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=CRM)) backed Snowflake Inc. ([SNOW Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SNOW)) surged 112% to $253.93 after hitting a high of $319 during the first day of debut.\n\nThis came after many investors went scrambling for a slice of the hottest tech stock this year. The maker of the database program doubled its valuation during its first day of trading from about $33 billion to just under $71 billion, making it the biggest IPO ever for a software firm.\n\nWith Snowflake\u2019s impressive growth track record and interest from Warren Buffett, investors might want to include SNOW stock in their list of [top tech stocks to buy](https://stockmarket.com/featured/top-3-tech-stocks-in-focus-after-tiktok-reaches-new-deal-2020-09-14) moving forward. Judging from its stellar performance during its first day of the public debut, there are good reasons for all the enthusiasm. But the big question here is, should investors chase SNOW stock at such a high valuation? Read on.\n\n## Should Investors Buy Into Snowflake Stock When It\u2019s Piping Hot?\n\nBefore deciding whether to invest in SNOW stock, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers to see where the company stands. If you have read Snowflake\u2019s S-1 filing, the first thing which probably caught your attention would be its ridiculous growth rates. Snowflake\u2019s 133% growth over the six months of 2020 and 158% net retention rate are terrific, to say the least. After yesterday\u2019s surge, Snowflake is trading at a whopping 175 times trailing-12-month sales, putting other [enterprise software stocks](https://stockmarket.com/featured/should-we-buy-these-enterprise-software-stocks-ahead-of-their-earnings-2020-08-24) to shame. However, with existing clients ramping up their spending on Snowflake\u2019s service, the company may just grow into its valuation. What looks expensive right now might not look so bad in just a couple of years.\n\nIf you have been actively searching for the [best stocks to buy](https://stockmarket.com/featured/are-these-the-best-stocks-to-buy-as-the-streaming-market-grows-2020-09-12), you would know that cloud stocks have soared to all-time high valuations. So, you could say that Snowflake has come to the market right when it is the hottest. But guess what, it didn\u2019t melt in the face of the heat. If anything, it has gotten investors all the more excited. But if you are looking for a quick flip, tread carefully. On the other hand, if you\u2019re planning to buy and hold it for the long term, then, by all means, feel free to take a chance at this red hot company.\n\n## What Does Snowflake Actually Do?\n\nWell, I\u2019ll admit I am not an IT expert here. Snowflake is a cloud-native data warehouse provider. That sets it apart from the likes of Oracle Corp. ([ORCL Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=ORCL)). Snowflake offers database solutions for storing data and running queries on those data. Unlike the competition, users do not have to pay upfront, and services can be scaled up or down in a flexible manner.\n\nThis flexibility extends to its pricing as well. The firm boasts 3,100 customers, 56 of which were each responsible for generating around $1 million in revenues within a 12-month period. While big cloud providers like Amazon.com Inc.([AMZN Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AMZN)), Microsoft Corp ([MSFT Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=MSFT)), and Alphabet Inc. ([GOOGL Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=GOOGL)) have similar offerings, Snowflake prides itself as being the standalone company which can run on all of these cloud platforms.\n\n## Cloud Stocks Could Still Move Higher Despite The Recent Pullback\n\nIn the cloud space, the pandemic has acted more as a tailwind than a headwind. There\u2019s a long list of cloud stocks that have been dominating the market of late. No doubt, unless there\u2019s a safe and effective vaccine, chances are today\u2019s new normal will stay for some time. For this reason, the recent pullback could provide opportunities for a quick flip. If you, like many other industry experts, believe that the cloud space will continue to thrive even after the pandemic, you should pay close attention to this space over the next decade.\n\nNow, Snowflake\u2019s IPO might have overshadowed JFrog\u2019s IPO ([FROG Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=FROG)). JFrog makes software for developers. It\u2019s worth noting that FROG stock has leaped 47% to $64.79 after hitting a high of $77 per share during its intraday.\n\nJFrog stock raised $504 million. Both SNOW stock and FROG stock priced above their expected ranges. Meanwhile, Tencent-backed online real estate platform KE Holdings ([BEKE Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=BEKE)) which debuted last month, also broke out yesterday. The rising tide in the tech space seems to lift all boats.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nIt\u2019s not always the case that IPOs open for trading much higher than the offering price. Of course, Snowflake\u2019s credibility is further boosted with Warren Buffett and Salesforce as their shareholders. But investors shouldn\u2019t be buying SNOW stock merely because they are. So when the stock eventually takes a breather, you won\u2019t be panic selling which would result in losses. Instead, take some time to study the company\u2019s product, the potential, and scalability of the business to make a more informed decision.\u00a0",
