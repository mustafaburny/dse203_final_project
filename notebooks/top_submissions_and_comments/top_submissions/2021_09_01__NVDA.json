        "selftext": "Ok look ive been seeing a lot of fking clov posts and i just want everyone to stop the confirmation biases real quick and rmr this.\n\nOut of the last 20 ish stocks wsb mentioned only 3 have been great , ( im excluding tesla and apple as they arent really meme stocks anymore )\n\nhere look at this sndl,bb,wish,gme,amc,wen,crsr,uwmc,rkt,rklb,sofi,sava,sklz,pltr,gld,root,em,mvis just to name a few out of all of the memes stocks discussed. out of those stocks really 3 of them are still going strong which are amc,gme,pltr the rest of these stocks just fell out, when i say fell out i mean they are back to around the price they orginally were granted maybe a buck or 2 higher due to so many bag holders but you see the point im bringing out.\n\n**PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO YOUR OWN DD AND COMPARE IT TO WHATEVER ANYONE SAYS ON THIS SUB.**\n\nAlso just needed to say this , investing and trading are different ... aver\n\nInvesting= I Dont give a fuck if pltr drops to 20 bucks or if it is range for a week or 2 , im buying in this company and expecting it to be worth 5x 5-10 years from now . These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.\n\nAnother example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.\n\nInvesting is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** \n\ntrading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.\n\nHere let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. \n\nShit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .\n\nShit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?\n\n**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**\n\nTHis isnt financial advice. This is just a bunch of my opinions i want to share with yall",

In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Bannon, management is on point\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CHIIIIIPPPPPPSSSSS - NOM NOM**\n\nGood morning ladies and gents. Lets talk about chips - semiconductors to be exact. If you have tried to purchase a car or refrigerator in the past few months you've noticed that either the price has increased or they are on backorder.\n\nUnfortunately, everything from your car's dashboard to your dragon shaped dildo now requires a computer chip. Because of this all this, the semiconductor/chip stocks have been shooting straight up (**AMD, TSM, NVDA**). Their valuations are high, but this is rightfully so since the semiconductor shortage is theoretically going to last until 2023 according to analysts (1). This is where **HIMX** enters the building.\n\n**HIMX** is a fabless semiconductor provider. They create a multitude of design solutions for visual displays (TV's, Laptops, mobile phones, car navigation, VR devices) as well as a whole host of additional products such as silicon IP's and LCOS micro displays for automotive HUD. The company is based in Taiwan, and has been chugging along during the pandemic, increasing their quarterly revenue growth by an impressive 95.5% yoy. It's quarterly earnings have beaten expectations during the last two quarters, but due to the China FUD and being located in Taiwan it's become risky for investors.\n\n**BEARISH POINTS**\n\nSo let me lay out the bear case before I start pumping the bull argument. There is a legitimate fear that China will eventually completely control Taiwan and impose the same tariffs that already exist for mainland China. This would drastically hurt business with the West, from which HIMX draws a large portion of it's customer base. Taiwan's position is that as long as they keep making semiconductors, they are important to the West, and we will protect them. At the moment, that's still the case, and looks like that will continue to be the case for the next few years.\n\nFrom a technical aspect this company is being shorted heavily. The put/call ratio is 1.34, the short interest on Aug 13th was 10.35%, and the short ratio everyday since Aug 13th has increased dramatically.\n\nSo if you think China doesn't plan to start WWIII, please keep reading.\n\n**BULLISH POINTS**\n\nThe bullish argument is that you have a company creating a product that is in high demand, and will continue to be in high demand in the near future. **TSM** has raised the prices of their semiconductors by 10% within the past month, it's likely that **HIMX** will follow suit. There are two opportunities for them to make this announcement within this week: Sept 6-7th dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021 and Sept 6-10th 22nd Credit Suisse Asian Technology Conference (2).\n\nWhen **HIMX** P/E is compared to other semiconductor stocks, it's much lower (Trailing P/E 9.94 vs. 32.55 for **TSM**). Within the past month the price action has pushed **HIMX** back down to the 200SMA, which it has been grinding along for the past week. The price action appears to be consolidating against the 200SMA which suggests a big move in either direction. According to FinTel the short borrow fee rate jumped from 0.7% to 1.86% on Sep 3rd. The number of shares available to borrow has been steadily decreasing within the past two weeks while the price has begun to stagnate. It appears HIMX is going to make a decent sized move soon, and with analysts suggesting a low PT of 19 and high 23.50, it's only a matter of time until this puppy pops (3).\n\nPositions:\n\n40x $13 10/15\n\nI had references to the little numbers in parenthesis, but WSB hates links, so I'm going to see if this gets through then I'll post them in the comments.

        "selftext": "**TL:DR** This post progresses in a way that outlines my logic and leads up to my theory that IONQ may not shit the bed post-merger and rather, could do quite well. However, I am just an \ud83e\udd8d and none of this is financial advice. All feedback is much appreciated.\n\n===============================================================================\n\nAs most on this sub know, PIPE investors are usually not bound by lockup provisions. There are exceptions (e.g. LCID) but they are the exception rather than the norm. In this post I\u2019d like to go through some observations relating to the DMYI/IonQ deal, which also involves a (partially) locked-up PIPE.\n\nTo be clear, I know zilch about quantum computing. You can read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/odncga/ionq_dmyi_the_leader_in_quantum_computing_15/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/odnfyt/ionq_dmyi_the_leader_in_quantum_computing_15/) brilliant DD if you\u2019d like to get into the technical details. This post is less about IonQ's business specifically than it is about its unique setup due to the existence of its PIPE lockups.\n\nThe implications of such PIPE lockups include:\n\n**1. They signal some commitment, or at least some long-term orientation, towards the de-SPAC target.**\n\n* This could reduce the chances of large PIPE dumps / huge selling pressure when PIPE is able to sell.\n* Furthermore, some of the subscription agreements contain very interesting clauses that reduce or altogether cancel the lockup periods if certain share price targets are met, in some cases if the shares exceed $40 and $65. This is very odd - are they expecting IONQ to actually pump to that price? Hmm..\n\n**2. A delayed PIPE unlock implies that the post-merger float is not ambushed by millions of shares hitting the market, at least for some time.**\n\n* If redemptions to DMYI are aplenty, this could make for some spicy stuff.\n\nI am much more interested in implication 1), because this could mean that despite being a very speculative play, IONQ might not get destroyed post merger due to the presence of the strategic long term PIPE investors, many of whom are bound by lockups.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# The Overview\n\nSo let\u2019s begin with some excerpts from DMYI\u2019s [latest S-4/A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521242312/d70340ds4a.htm). From P.102:\n\n&gt;From January 14, 2021 through March 5, 2021, dMY\u2019s advisors engaged in calls and correspondence with potential strategic investors in the PIPE Investment and their respective counsel. During this period, dMY and IonQ discussed the terms of such strategic investors\u2019 investment in the PIPE Investment and negotiated the terms of the subscription agreements of such investors. The terms of such strategic investors\u2019 subscription agreements were finalized on March 5, 2021. **A principal issue for the subscription agreements for strategic investors was the inclusion of lock-up provisions**.\n\nOdd, because PIPE usually has no lockup. Then from P.135:\n\n&gt;On March 7, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, dMY entered into the Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors, pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for 35,000,000 shares of Class A Stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $350.0 million.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Strategic Investors have agreed to be bound by lock-up provisions with respect to their subscribed shares. The lock-up periods for Strategic Investors vary between 6 and 18 months,** subject to certain conditions, depending on the number of shares of Class A Stock subscribed for by each Strategic Investor and a number of other factors\\*\\*. **Venture capital and other investors have agreed to be bound by lock-up provisions with respect to their subscribed shares for a period of six months**,\\*\\* subject to the terms of their subscription agreements or, in the case of certain investors that were previously investors in dMY, the Lock-Up Agreement.\n\nSo there's a **$350M PIPE with lockups**, but the reality is actually more nuanced. There are seven separate subscription agreements in the exhibits to the S-4/A (exhibits 10.9-10.15). Six of them have a section entitled \u201cTransfer Restrictions\u201d which specify lockup provisions, while one does not. Let\u2019s go through the subscription agreements to iron out the important details.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# Review of Subscription Agreements\n\nI\u2019ll start with the easiest ones:\n\n1. **Exhibit 10.12,** [**MSD Subscription Agreement**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex104.htm)\n\n* **Who are they?** MSD Capital is \u201ca private investment firm that manages the capital of Michael Saul Dell (yes, that Michael Dell) and his family\u201d\n* **No. of Shares:** 4M (implied from below)\n\n&gt;Section 3l) states:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement, the Company is entering into the Other Subscription Agreements providing for the sale of 31,000,000 Other Subscribed Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $310,000,000\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The PIPE size is 35M shares, implying MSD is buying 4M shares.\n\n* **Lockup Provisions (from Section 9)**\n   * **Lockup period is 6 months post closing** unless:\n      * If, between the closing date and 3 months post closing, IONQ\u2019s share price is \u2265 $40 for any 20 trading days within any 30 day trading period (hereafter abbreviated to \u201c20/30\u201d), **the lockup period is reduced to 3 months.**\n      * If, between the closing date and 3 months post closing, IONQ\u2019s share price is \u2265 $65 for any 20/30 days, **the lockup period is immediately terminated.**\n      * If, between 3 months post closing and 6 months post closing, IONQ\u2019s share price is  \u2265 $40 for any 20/30 days, **the lockup period is immediately terminated.**\n   * Hmm, this is odd, isn\u2019t it? Why go through the trouble to include these clauses with astronomical share prices? Does that mean the sponsor/subscriber thinks IONQ stock can actually achieve those targets? You decide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Exhibit 10.14,** [**BEV Subscription Agreement**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex106.htm)**.**\n\n* This is very similar to MSD\u2019s subscription agreement. Relevant details are:\n* **Who are they?** \u201cBreakthrough Energy Ventures is the clean-tech venture capital fund led by Bill Gates\u201d\n* **No. of shares (implied from section 3l):** 2.5M shares\n* **Lockup Provisions:** Same as MSD. The $40 and $65 clauses are there as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Exhibit 10.13,** [**Silver Lake**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex105.htm)**:**\n\n* **Who are they?** A \u201cglobal private equity firm focused on investments in technology, technology-enabled and related industries.\u201d\n* **No. of shares (implied from section 3m):** 6M shares.\n* **Lockup Provisions:**\n   * 1/3 of shares: NO lockup;\n   * 1/3 of shares: Lockup period is 18 months;\n   * 1/3 of shares: Lockup period ends on the earlier of (1) 12 months and (2) the date at which IONQ\u2019s share price is \u2265 $12 for any 20/30 days commencing 150 days post closing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Hyundai and Kia:\n\n**4. Exhibit 10.10,** [**Hyundai:**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex102.htm)\n\n* **No. of shares:** Couldn\u2019t find this info.\n* **Lockup Provisions:** 6 months post closing.\n\n**5. Exhibit 10.11,** [**Kia**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex103.htm)**:**\n\n* **No. of shares:** Couldn\u2019t find this info.\n* **Lockup Provisions:** 6 months post closing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe remaining two subscription agreements are more general in nature, tailored towards a more differentiated group of investors:\n\n**6. Exhibit 10.15,** [**VC Investors/Other Investors:**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex107.htm)\n\n* **Who are they?** Not specifically listed, but according to the IONQ investor deck and Google news on past fundraising rounds, some of these backers include Google Ventures, HP, Airbus, Samsung, Acme\u2026\n* **No. of shares:** Not listed.\n* **Lockup Provisions:** 6 months post closing.\n\n**7. Exhibit 10.9,** [**\u201cFinancial Investors\":**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex101.htm)\n\n* This is the most general and yet the most obscure. What are financial investors?\n* **No. of shares:** Not listed.\n* **Lockup Provisions:** This agreement lacks a section on Transfer Restrictions, unlike all of the other agreements listed above. **THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO LOCKUPS FOR THIS GROUP OF PIPE INVESTORS.** This would also make sense if \u201cfinancial investors\u201d represents your \u201cfast money hedge funds.\u201d\n* Furthermore, in the [March 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521072373/d142872d8k.htm) it is mentioned that:\n\n&gt;Subscription Agreements entered into by and among the Company and each of Hyundai Motor Company (\u201cHyundai\u201d), KIA Motors Corporation (\u201cKia\u201d), MSD Partners, L.P. (\u201cMSD\u201d), Silver Lake Partners VI DE (AIV), L.P. (\u201cSilver Lake\u201d) and Breakthrough Energy Ventures II, L.P. (**\u201cBEV,\u201d and together with Hyundai, Kia, MSD and Silver Lake, the \u201cStrategic Investors\u201d**), are filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6, respectively...\n\nThey also then say \"The **Strategic Investors** have agreed to be bound by lock-up provisions with respect to their subscribed shares\", referring to the aforementioned group. However, the \"financial investors\" are not specifically included as part of the \"strategic investors,' suggesting that they are NOT bound by these lock-ups.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# So What?\n\n**Conclusions:** From the above, assuming IONQ does not pump beyond $12 (or $40, or $65 lol), it follows that:\n\n* 4M+2.5M (MSD+BEV) = 6.5M shares are locked up for 6 months\n* A bunch more shares (Kia+Hyundai+VC\u2019s+Other Investors) are locked up for 6 months\n   * Unfortunately I am unable to estimate how many shares this group owns\n* 2M (\u2153 Silver Lake) shares are locked up for at least 12 months\n* 2M (\u2153 Silver Lake) shares are locked up for 18 months\n* At the very minimum, **that's 10.5M of the 35M PIPE shares locked up for at least 6 months**\n\n**Theory:** **Due to significant lockups and the presence of strategic/long-term investors, it is possible that IONQ does not dump bigly post merger and instead ends up doing quite well. But don\u2019t take it from me; take it from the sponsor:**\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# Sponsor Commentary (aka Sponsor Pumping)\n\nDMYI\u2019s CEO, a dude by the name of Niccolo De Masi, was recently interviewed on several outlets and made some comments on the SPAC deal, the PIPE, etc. To be fair, I think the guy has a pumper\u2019s aura and his comments should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, here is some of what he said, so you can evaluate his comments yourself:\n\nFrom [IPO Edge Fireside Event](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521273799/d214884d425.htm) (September 14 2021):\n\n&gt;\u201cExciting days ahead as the world\u2019s first listed quantum computing pure play with obviously plenty of capital behind them now. **The pipe is $350 million.** T**hey only need half of that, I think, to be a profitable operating business**, so there\u2019s plenty of room for acquisitions and organic consolidation. I think this is going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the corner community space permanently.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe only thing I\u2019d point out that I think some of you have asked in the chat that I\u2019ve seen is lockups. A**nd yeah, look, most pipes in the market have no lockup, but because Peter and Niccolo** *(P.S. from yours truly: did this guy just refer to himself in 3rd person?)* **thought about this in advance and shareholders that are also useful strategic partners and customers, the lockups actually are quite extensive.** **So some of them can go out to 18 months, but there\u2019s a minimum of sort of six months from pipe investors.** **So the stock\u2019s going to trade exceptionally well, I think, and** **there\u2019s not going to be a pressure from pipe shareholders trying to recycle capital**\\*\\*.\\*\\* And that\u2019s a reason for everybody in this call to be excited, who\u2019s an investor.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is actually kind of one of the most world strangest SPACS. And then let me explain that. We went out and got anchor investors into the pipe and actually had all the money raised before we actually started the pipe investors from strategic investors. People like Breakthrough Energy and Bill Gates and Michael Dell and those kinds of people. **So we\u2019re an unusual SPAC in that we\u2019re not filled, on our pipe side, with a bunch of hedge funds. We did not fit. Those are not who are invested in this company**\\*\\*. We really wanted to go for people who had this long term vision for the company. And that\u2019s largely who are our investors are in both the dMY side and also on the IonQ pipe side.\\*\\*\n\nFrom [ICR Event Series](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521217476/d196587d425.htm) (July 15, 2021)\n\n&gt;Yeah. So, I mean, look, we\u2019ve raised the largest pipe, actually, that dMY has on any of our four transactions, **and it was the most heavily oversubscribed,** believe it or not. I think the reason for that is there\u2019s **huge strategic interest in the company**. I mean, you saw us announce a $350 million PIPE with people like Dell and Mubadala, and Sovereign wealth funds are interested. Companies are interested. Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures interested, obviously. Silver Lake\u2019s in there. Everything Peter has been talking about, I think is well diligenced and well understood not just by the Google, Amazon, Microsoft trio, who are cloud partners, but everybody that\u2019s the strategic part of the pipe. You can assume that there are many other conversations, people who wanted to be in the pipe. SoftBank came in afterwards, obviously, and there was a partnership there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I think it\u2019s safe to say that our **pipe investors are very bullish that this is a business that hopefully will look something like an Nvidia 10 years from today** and maybe an RM along the way. It will have tremendous value to every area of applied science.\n\nAnd this is where he turned me off because he sounds like a Stocktwits Paid Pumper:\n\n&gt;And the reality is, our goal here with the $650 million of capital they\u2019ll have post-transaction close is obviously to **be the next Nvidia, to be the next Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, etc.** And I do think that if you look at the tech landscape, what engineering advantage do you have to be the next $100 billion, maybe even trillion dollar market cap company in the coming decades. It\u2019s something as big as quantum computing. A lot of other people get picked off along the way, and I\u2019m sure it will get offers along the way because we\u2019re still very, very affordable every step of the way. B**ut I really do think that this has the makings of not just being a 100 bagger from the $10 pipe investment position, but this is hopefully a 1,000 bagger, 10,000 bagger in the coming decade or two.**\n\nAs you can see, although Niccolo makes grandiose statements in the spirit of your average Stocktwits citizen, he has also presented some cases suggesting that this stock will be just fine after the merger.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# BONUS 1: This sub ain't the only one buying warrants\n\nFrom the S-4/A, [Exhibit 10.33](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521217582/d70340dex1033.htm) shows that Amazon has warrants to purchase IONQ equity. I tried reading this agreement but my \ud83e\udd8d brain didn\u2019t get very far before quitting. Someone smarter, like apan-man will be in a much better position to explain this. I\u2019m just bringing to light the fact that this exists, and it seems like it\u2019s under the radar.\n\n# BONUS 2: Follow the warrants?\n\nFor DMYI, DMY (the sponsor) bought 4M warrants in a private placement worth $8M. Thus they paid $2 per warrant.\n\n* For DMYQ (Planet), the sponsor bought private warrants at only $1.50 apiece\n* For GENI, the sponsor also paid only $1.50 per private warrant\n* For RSI, the sponsor paid only $1 per private warrant\n* So why did they pay $2 this time around and use DMYI to acquire IONQ?Is it a coincidence? Is it a show of confidence on their part?\n* If you look at the DMYI warrants chart, you will notice that they have held up fairly well, hovering above $2 most of the time\n* They are (at the time of this writing) \\~$3, which is possibly indicative of strong performance of the shares post de-SPAC\n\n# BONUS 3: Let's go get a bigger PIPE\n\nAnother interesting thing I found is that the PIPE was apparently upsized twice. From the [December 2020 IONQ](https://www.dmytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IonQDeck-6.44-print.pdf) deck which is somehow on DMY's website (although not posted directly \ud83d\ude09), the deal was structured as follows:\n\nThen in the [February 2021 deck](https://www.dmytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IonQ-Management-Presentation.pdf), the PIPE was increased by $100M:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5kc5rhzh2p71.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13f02eafced051cdfb8d3b5b82828b12ed22c90a\n\nAnd in the [final investor deck](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e33152a051d2e7588f7571c/t/60459578b8c075444a656357/1615173012167/IonQ+Investor+Presentation+030721+vFF.pdf), the PIPE was increased by another $100M:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1083izk0i2p71.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54b180230c17de4e894df12a6ae5ac937e1d3a0d\n\nThis seems to corroborate Niccolo's comments that this company was in high demand.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8pcuen1i2p71.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87658e471a8f23efb62d8c914497f85894b8086e\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# Disclosures:\n\n* I am long 5000 DMYI shares and 1 DMYI/W\n* ***This is NOT financial advice.

production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Wait, Wait, before you downvote me into the depths of hells, let me explain. First, I have been contemplating buying puts on NVDA for about a month now, and it's kept on going up and the only reason I haven't pulled the trigger yet is because I feel like I'm missing something so let me explain my case, then you explain why I'm wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, first, NVDA is a 550 billion dollar company with 20 billion in revenue and a P/E of nearly 80, and a forward P/E of 60. This is literally SENILE, in 2000, when Intel was all the shit, as a 300 billion dollar company it had a P/E of 40, and now 20 years later it's still down while it's doubles it's revenue and 4x it's profit. So, with NVDA trading at a multiple of 80, even if let's say they 3x their eps in the next 5 years which is an extremely absurd assumption as they've already had a ton of growth fueled from cover, they would have 9 dollars of EPS and looking at today's stock price, if it stayed the same they would still be trading at a multiple of 24 which is ridiculous if they somehow just 4x their revenue in a matter of 5 years. Looking at all the growth catalysts I would find it only somewhat reasonable if they 2x their profit which would give them 6 dollars of EPS and keep them at a P/E of 40. That is once again Intels multiple at the peak of 2000 when it was also half the market cap. \n\nLastly, NVDA has gone up nearly 100% from it's lows in February for two reasons, slightly better than expected earnings and a stock split, none of which would justify that movement. \n\nSo, that's what I'm thinking, I HAVE TO BE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT?, why does this seem so overvalued as such a large company, can someone please explain because if not those 2024 140 strike price puts are looking real sexy.",

        "selftext": "tock: Nvidia\n\nTicker: $NVDA\n\n**#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** \n\nTo begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, let\u2019s use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the company\u2019s average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So let\u2019s break it down\n\nEV stands for \u201cEnterprise Value\u201d. Enterprise value is made up of the company\u2019s equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the company\u2019s value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the company\u2019s shares.\n\nSo we have nvidia\u2019s equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billions) so we have the EV: 549.69B (information gathered by Merrill Lynch) \n\nNow that we have the EV, what is EBITDA? EBITDA or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization is simply putted as the measure of profitability. Like EV, its just a way of understanding a business\u2019s profitability better than net income can. Debt to Equity ratio, Free Cash Flow Yield, P/E Ratio are also helpful, but we aren\u2019t going there. \n\nFormula: So we\u2019ll take the Net Income of Nvidia which is Earnings before Interest, then we\u2019ll add interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Based off of a 10-k provided by the SEC, the Net Income: 4,332, Interest: 184, Taxes: 77, D and A: 1,098 \n\nEBITDA: 5.69B (in billions) \n\nSo we have the EV/EBITDA of 96.2 \n\nWhat do we do with this information? We can now compare it to the industry average. You\u2019re looking for them to trade underneath the average. The Software and AI EV/EBITDA average is 106, so Nvidia is trading underneath the industry average. \n\n**Historical Price Target(s) + Business Fundamentals (Fundamental Analysis)**\n\nBefore Nvidia\u2019s stock split (4:1) Nvidia was trading at a high of $750+. While considering we are in an eight year exponential tech bull run, I still think Nvidia was room to run back to close or even as high as its prior high. \n\nTesla stock was trading at around $2,213 before their split of 5:1. Then Tesla ran from $80 to almost $900 in a single year. Of course that was attributed to the bull run/short squeeze, but for Nvidia that could mean something. For Tesla to 10x in a year, isn\u2019t hard for nvidia to 2x or even 3x from its current trading price based on their prior movements. Tesla\u2019s 5 year gain in percentages is 1,838% while Nvidias 5 year gain is 1.401%. Their historical price movement is very similar so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising is nvidia followed Tesla on a smaller, slower scale. \n\nBesides that, Nvidias business is huge for the retail consumption. Bitcoin miners and Gamers have been on a ramped uptrend for the past years and is ever growing. The main graphics card usage is for gamers and miners. So the disruption of graphics card and the demand will be huge for the foreseeable future. \n\n**#2: Technical Analysis** \n\nMany people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn\u2019t as black and white, but that\u2019s the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\nDaily Chart: \n\nSorry, chart is supposed to be here, but stocks doesn't allow.\n\nI can see Nvidia moving in two different ways within the next few weeks.\n\nOption A: We see nvidia break the flag and break above the all time high of $230 and make a new high\n\nOr Option B: We get rejected off the all time high or fail the break out and head down to the $206-207 support.\n\nBut Nvidia isn\u2019t a short term play, Tesla took a year to 10x so this is definitely a 1-3 year play at least. \n\n**How I\u2019m playing Nvidia**\n\nYes, I\u2019m in nvidia. I wanted to make this so I can get criticism on my first Due Diligence and what I can fix or what I can add. I know this is super choppy and all over the place and I\u2019m sure I missed more important things, but this is where I\u2019m starting.\n\nI have 20% of my portfolio allocated to Nvidia. 12% in shares and 8% in long ATM calls dating in 2023. \n\nPrice Target: $300-$500+ depending on how fast the stock grows. \n\nPlease critique this as I only want to grow as an investor, but please keep the roasting to a minimum :D",

With the negative outlook, S&amp;P believed there is a likelihood of at least one-in-three of a downward rating adjustment within two years.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;August 5, 2011: Standard &amp; Poor's lowered the credit rating of the United States from AAA to AA+, citing Congressional resistance to new revenue measures and uncontrolled growth of entitlement programs. The agency rated the long-term outlook as negative, citing uncertainty in debt growth dynamics\n\nMarkets were given plenty of time but they did nothing and because if this we had Black Monday.\n\n&gt;By market close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 634.76 points (-5.55%) to close at 10,809.85, making it the 6th largest drop of the index in history.\\[5\\] Black Monday 2011 followed just one trading day behind the 10th largest drop of the Dow Jones Index, a 512.76 (-4.31%) drop on August 4, 2011\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SPY 2011 Chart leading to Black Monday.](https://preview.redd.it/j5n4suolqem71.png?width=1460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f2b7737a80cff9cc92c6f89e6c460d13eda6300)\n\n**Why am I bringing this up today ?**\n\nToday aunt Yellen, wrote a big, bold and beautiful letter again to Pelosi warning her to close here long NVDA and big tech plays and buy some Puts.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 28, 2021**\n\nStocks sank today, as technology stocks plummeted, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) having its worst day since March as investors nervously eye a swift rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, a disappointing consumer confidence report, and power shortages in China that threaten the global supply chain as the busy Christmas season approaches, along with the evolving Evergrande situation. \n\nMarket participants continue to diest development coming out of Washington.  Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-government-funding-e7bfe8a6ffdb40a8d33e17ef11ded7a7\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.54% at the time of writing, the highest level since June. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.\n\nChris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG Group, said \u201cthe prospect of higher energy prices, fueling inflation, and rises in bond yields appear to be pre-empting tighter monetary policy by central banks, have prompted widespread selling across global stock markets. Like yesterday, it is the highly-valued growth stocks that have taken the brunt of the selling, as investors fret that a lower growth, tighter policy environment will hurt these previous star performers.\u201d \n\nAccording to a report by the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, US consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low amid the surge in coronavirus Delta variant cases (which are finally starting to fall again), supply chain issues, and a slowdown in growth rates moving forward. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 109.3 this month from 115.2 in August, the third straight monthly decline. Lynne Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board said, \u201cThese back-to-back declines suggest consumers have grown more cautious and are likely to curtail spending going forward\u201d.\n\n[https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm](https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm)\n\nIn other news,  a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country\u2019s electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n[https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904)\n\nThere are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Tuesday the Chinese government is blocking its domestic airlines from buying \"tens of billions of dollars\" in airplanes. Raimondo said in remarks after a speech in Washington that China is not abiding by commitments to buy U.S. goods it made in 2020 as part of a trade deal. \"I don't know if Boeing is here... There are tens of billions of dollars of planes that Chinese airlines want to buy but the Chinese government is standing in the way.\"\n* Disney (DIS) and Amazon (AMZN) announced they were partnering together to launch an Alexa-powered voice assistant called \u201cHey Disney\u201d which will be available at home Echo\u2019s as well as the ones located in Disney resorts and hotels\n* Netflix (NFLX) released five new mobile gaming titles to subscribers in select European markets, as the company attempts to diversify revenue sources. The company has introduced \"Stranger Things: 1984\", \"Stranger Things 3: The Game\", \"Card Blast\", \"Teeter Up\", and \"Shooting Hoops\" titles on Android to Netflix members in Spain and Italy.\n* Following a ruling by the CCP, Alibaba (BABA) and other internet companies can no longer omit competitors\u2019 products from their own platforms in an effort to increase competition. As a result, Alibaba has now added rival Tencent (TCEHY) WeChat payment system in some of its platforms. \n* According to a joint report by consulting firms JD Power and LMC Automotive, new vehicle sales in the US are expected to fall a staggering 25% compared to last year, just the latest example of the effect the global shortage in semiconductors is having in the automotive industry. New-vehicle retail sales in the United States are seen dropping to 888,900 units in September, from 1,182,788 a year ago.\n* Ford Motor Co and its Korean battery partner SK Innovation will invest $11.4 billion to build an electric F-150 assembly plant and three battery plants in the United States, accelerating the U.S. automaker's push into electric vehicles.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Costco (COST) target raised by Citigroup from $460 to $495 at Neutral. Stock currently around $448\n* Etsy (ETSY) target raised by Loop Capital from $220 to $245 at Buy. Stock currently around $211\n* Generac (GNRC) target raised by Roth Capital from $480 to $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $425\n* Fortinet (FTNT) target raised by Cowen from $335 to $385 at Outperform. Stock currently around $288\n* NVIDIA (NVDA) target raised by Susquehanna from $220 to $250 at Positive. Stock currently around $206\n* Progyny (PGNY) target raiosed by Barclays from $72 to $80 at Overweight. Stock currently around $56\n\n\u201cNever think that lack of variability is stability. Don't confuse lack of volatility with stability.\u201d - Nassim Nicholas Taleb",

I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months\u2026\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs\u2026however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid\u2026.\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be\u2026however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially\u2026.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.",

Even though that stock did not age well, I thought the DD post format was great. \n\nHere's my take on Cepton, with the conclusion that they are flying under the radar at the moment and this is quite an opportunity to invest.\n\n  \n\nTopics to be Discussed:\n  \n\n-   Overview\n-   Leadership\n-   Board of Directors\n-   Products, Services, and Technology\n-   Partnerships and Customers\n-   Competition\n-   SPAC Transaction Overview\n-   Financials and Fundamentals\n-   Forward-Looking Statements and Speculation\n-   Bear Case\n-   Notes and resources for further DD \n-   Conclusion \n\n  \n  \n\n# Overview\n\nCepton provides state-of-the-art, intelligent, lidar-based solutions for a range of markets such as automotive (ADAS/AV), smart cities, smart spaces, and smart industrial applications. Cepton\u2019s patented MMT\u00ae-based lidar technology enables reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solutions that deliver long range, high resolution 3D perception for smart applications.\n\n  \n\nFrom the very start, Cepton has focused on the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) market. As disclosed in the S-4 filing, Cepton has the largest known lidar production award - GM selected Cepton as their lidar supplier for upcoming 2023-2027 cars featuring UltraCruise functionality.  Cepton has designed a suite of lidars exceptionally attractive to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like GM, Ford, and all other top 10 OEMs by being:\n\n - automotive grade\n - small form factor &amp; best-in-class performance\n - ultra competitive price (tech advantage)\n - partnership with tier 1 supplier (mass production)\n\n  \n\nFounded in April 2016 and led by industry veterans with over two decades of collective experience across a wide range of advanced lidar and imaging technologies, Cepton is focused on the mass market commercialization of high performance, high quality lidar solutions. Cepton is headquartered in San Jose, California, USA, with a presence in Germany, Canada, Japan and India, to serve a fast-growing global customer base.\n\n  \n\nCepton is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **GCAC.** A [press statement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html) released on August 5th, 2021 suggests that the merger is \"expected to close in the Q4 2021\". The S-4 was filed September 8th, 2021, and is available [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29). \n\n  \n\n**Investors:**\n\n  \n\nKoito Manufacturing, LDV Partners, GRC SinoGreen, Plug and Play Tech Center \n\n  \n  \n\n# Leadership\n\n  \n\n-   Jun Pei, CEO, from Velodyne, Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford\n-   Mark McCord, CTO, from KLA-Tencor, Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford\n-   Winston Fu, CFO, from LDV Partners, Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Stanford, MBA from Kellogg\n-   T.R.

According to both Cepton's investor presentation and S-4 filing, these things take considerable time (2+ years) &amp; have incredible competition (at least 30 lidars considered for GM production award). No other lidar company expects deployment on a significant number of vehicle models (especially non-luxury) anytime in the near future.\n\n  \n\nMicrovision (MVIS) has completed their **prototype** lidar in April 2021. Cepton finished their prototype in 2017, and is currently fine tuning the mass production process. Futhermore, Microvision recently claimed that they would win the markets by being cheap and selling their lidars for an AVERAGE of less than $1000. Cepton lidars are &lt; $500 with the Nova lidar being &lt; $100. Needless to say, Cepton is not concerned with competition from Microvision at the moment.\n\n  \n\nAnother interesting fact I noticed: many Velodyne and Innoviz leaders have left and decided to join Cepton.\n\n  \n\n# SPAC Transaction Overview\n\n  \n\n-   Transaction reflects a ~$1.5Bn value for Cepton\n-   Ownership: 85% Cepton shareholders, 12% SPAC IPO &amp; founder shares, 3% PIPE investors \n-   $58.5mm PIPE raised\n-   $1.774 bn pro forma equity value\n-   $1.549 bn pro forma enterprise value\n -   1.8x  2025E revenue of $861mm\n -   4.6x 2025E Adj. EBITDA of $339mm\n-   $225mm pro forma cash (includes Cepton's $34mm cash position)\n-   The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Cepton and Growth Capital Acquisition Corp.\n-   Expected to close \"Q4 2021\"\n-   [Form 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-100487/)\n\n  \n\n# Financials\n\n  \n\n**All data derived from SEC forms and the** [investor presentation.](https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf)\n\n  \n\n-   **2025E EBITDA:** 39%\n-   **2026E Free Cash Flow:** $389MM\n-   **'21E-'26E CAGR:** 207% (Peer median 153%)\n-   **'25E-'26E Adj. Gross Margin:** 51-53% (Peer median 56%)\n-   **'25E-'26E EBITDA Margin:** 39%-44% (Peer mediuan 31%)\n-   **'25E Valuation:** 1.8x (Peer median 2.1x)\n-   **'26E Valuation:** 1.3x (Peer median 2.1x)\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAs of writing this, GCAC is trading at $9.89, below the theoretical floor of $10 for SPACs.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n# Bear Cases \n\n  \n\nThe merger falls apart. This seems quite unlikely as both Cepton and GCAC have experienced leadership &amp; backgrounds. \n\n  \n\nCepton's deal with GM falls through. While again this is theoretically possible, the chances seem very small based on the investor presentation &amp; S-4 filing. Cepton had been in talks with GM for years before the announcement, and GM went through an extensive selection process of over 40 other lidar companies. Furthermore, Cepton is already partnered and supported by Koito, a Tier 1 supplier already approved and supplying parts for GM vehicles. \n\n  \n\nThe AV market is a bust. Cepton is currently focused on mass-market Lidar serving ADAS, which is a very real &amp; growing market. While it is true that currently the lidar market is pretty saturated, there is definitely an addressable market for ADAS in vehicles in the next 5 years. Cepton's ability to actually land the largest known Lidar production deal is nothing to scoff at. \n\n  \n\n# Notes and resources\n\nI urge everyone to do their own research &amp; DD. \n\nHere's a list of resources to start with: \n\n- [Investor presentation](https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf](https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf)) \n- [S-4 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29) \n- [Press release for Cepton + GCAC merger](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html)\n- [Forbes - GM selects Cepton to supply Lidar](https://www.dailyadvent.com/news/9283e8963297dea4b9b25a78e41113f6-General-Motors-Selects-Cepton-To-Supply-Lidar-For-2023-Production) \n- [Cepton patents](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Cepton&amp;oq=assignee:(Cepton)](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Cepton&amp;oq=assignee:(Cepton))) \n- [Cepton products](https://www.cepton.com/products/overview](https://www.cepton.com/products/overview)) \n- [Q&amp;A interview with Cepton CEO](https://www.just-auto.com/interview/lidar-of-the-pack-qa-with-cepton/](https://www.just-auto.com/interview/lidar-of-the-pack-qa-with-cepton/)) \n\n  \n\n# Conclusion\n\n  \n\nCepton has strong fundamentals, landed impressive deals and partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout leader in the lidar market. ADAS (safety &amp; assist) is not as sexy as AV (self driving), but there is a clear market for it TODAY, and Cepton has already taken the first step with the landmark deal to supply lidar for multiple GM cars.\n\n  \n\nAs of writing this post, GCAC is trading at $9.89, and is a relatively low-risk investment as SPAC's typically have a $10 floor due to the ability to redeem the stock at closing of the merger for $10.\n\nWhile the lidar &amp; SPAC markets are not so hot at the moment, I still see Cepton as undervalued at the moment, and the situation as a great low-downside investment opportunity. If Cepton succeeds with its engagements with all top 10 OEM's, then this current price would be one hell of a steal. \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n**Game plan**  \n\nI bought &amp; plan to hold shares for several years. \n\nYou can also just play the merger - buy now, then hold until the merger date &amp; decide then whether to keep or sell.\n  \n- Buy shares, GCAC will change to CPTN after the merger. Shares will be 1:1\n- Warrants, GCACW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50\n- Options trading - buying calls &amp; selling puts\n\n  \n  \n\n**TL;DR:** \n\nCepton quietly landed massive deals &amp; partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout lidar company. Currently GCAC is trading at &lt;$10, which is usually the floor for SPACs. This seems like a fairly low-risk low-downside investment, with great upsides at the moment since awareness of Cepton is so low.\n\nYou could also check out [their investor presentation.](https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf)\n\n  \n\n_Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nothing I ever say or do is a financial recommendation.

        "selftext": "I have a taxable trade account that I put my extra savings into, I have it margin enabled to take advantage of short term buy opportunities.  For example, 2 days ago I bought NVDA on margin and have a 7.5% gain.  I should sell it now to keep from over extending margin (haven't sold yet).  That is how I intended to use margin (buy, hold for a few days, sell).\n\nIn the spring, I took a big position in AAPL when as it was dipped under $130.  It kept going down so I kept buying.  That position is up quite nicely. (I'd like to learn how to spot the bottom and buy on the way up, but that's for later). \n\nAround the same time, I took positions in (and am still holding) MSFT, NVDA, V &amp; WMT, which are all up.  I also have some taxable GME gains from earlier this year too. \n\nI also took positions in (and am still holding) ARKW &amp; CRSR.  The losses on these positions almost wash with the AAPL gains.  CRSR is especially frustrating as I really do think it should be in the mid $30's.\n\nSince the AAPL gains and ARKW &amp; CRSR losses pretty much wash, when the market dipped earlier this week the entire account was showing a loss.  It's back up but still lower than where it was a few weeks ago.\n\nSo, here's the problem: as it sits, a bit less than half my positions are currently held in margin and I don't have any more funds to send in to reduce it.  I'm pretty certain I want to eliminate my margin holdings, I just don't know when and how many of which shares I should trim.\n\nI can't tell if we're going to be going into more or less volatility in the coming weeks so I don't exactly know what to do.\n\nIf I cut the losers and CRSR finally bounces, I'll be very frustrated but those losses will reduce my taxable GME gains.  If I trim all holdings equally it just seems unfocused.\n\nSuggestions on what and when to trim?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 3, 2021**\n\nStocks finished the day mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) falling while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pushed higher, closing 0.31% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.46%. Market participants are digesting the release of the August Jobs Report, which showed a sharp deceleration in employment amid the latest surge by the coronavirus Delta variant. \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nThis is a little confusing but follow me here. In a weird quirk of the market, the low employment numbers actually benefit equities by staving off the need for tapering, which is why we saw tech stocks in particular popping today. Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d Regardless, as I have said before, I remain unconcerned by taper talks, I think the real test for equities will come when discussion about potential interest rate hikes begins.\n\nSteve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said of the report \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the market really trying to wrestle with the idea of what matters to it more: Is it about the economy, or is it about monetary policy? Now, we\u2019ve been in a monetary-driven market for so long it\u2019s hard to say that monetary factors aren\u2019t at the forefront of the market\u2019s mindset right now. But what I think we may be seeing here \u2026 we can\u2019t really figure out whether this delays tapering in a meaningful way. But there\u2019s stuff in here that is not necessarily bad other than the headline number. Wages are good, the unemployment rate is good.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Moderna (MRNA), Workday (WDAY), Nvidia (NVDA) were among the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq today, driving it higher.\n* US auto safety regulators disclosed they are investigating a July 26 fatal crash involving a Tesla that may or may not have been using the advanced driver assistance system. This is the latest regulatory headache for Tesla and their autonomous driving technology given there is already another investigation currently underway.\n* Dish\u2019s (DISH) Sling TV, which reportedly has 2.7 million subs as of December 2020, has partnered with Penn National Gaming (PENN) to launch a Barstools Sports Channel on its streaming service. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which owns popular dating app Tinder, filed a letter with Dutch competition regulators to public state their decision regarding a complaint filed against Apple for anti-competitive practices for forcing Match to use Apple\u2019s in-app payment system. Ever since Fortnite-maker Epic Games\u2019 original lawsuit against Apple regarding this seems more and more companies are hopping on. A new South Korean law that was recently passed forces Apple and Google to accept third-party payment systems.\n* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s drive to \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d. \n* Beyond Meats (BYND) COO Sanjay Shah steps down from his role with no public explanation given. He originally joined the company from Tesla in 2019\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Adobe (ADBE) target raised by Argus from $650 to $764 at Buy. Stock currently around $665\n* Broadcom (AVGO) with a host of target raises. Average price target $550 at Buy. Stock currently around $498\n* DocuSign (DOCU) with a host of target raises. Average price target $345 at Buy. Stock currently around $310\n* Lululemon (LULU) target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $440 to $460 at Outperform. Stock currently around $388\n* Quanta Services (PWR) with three target raises.

Stock currently around $27\n* Kirkland (KIRK) target raised by Craig Hallum from $37 to $40 at Buy.

strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone. Happy Saturday and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months\u2026\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs\u2026however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid\u2026.\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be\u2026however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially\u2026.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.",

It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production.\n\nThe global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued.

        "selftext": "Okay , so basically I started trading in April I started with 700 dollars and turned that into 6,000 with AMC which was pretty much pure luck on my part. But then I decided I wanted to trade options...that's when things went downhill. My account is again now worth 700 dollars. And I've added another 1500 this last month. Still account is worth 700. Point is I'm clearly doing something wrong here. How should I manage my risk? Should I just buy and hold EFT'S or growth stocks like nvda ? I like trading options because of the rewards involved but clearly I'm not reaping those . Every single time I buy a call or put it goes the other way. Then my premium just melts away to nothing and even when it goes back up the option is negative. I really like investing and don't want to stop putting my money into it because I know the potential growth that can be achieved. I really need some good advice/help. I'm willing to pay for it weather that's a 1 on 1 coach or something with stock alerts.  Idk something to improve my skills  and my returns",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 16, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed in a volatile session after getting a boost following the release of new economic data that showed retail sales for the month of August coming in stronger-than-expected, suggesting that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, held up despite rising coronavirus Delta variant concerns. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day with a gain of 0.07% and 0.08% respectively. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 0.17% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.17% and 0.19% down respectively. Jobless claims also came in near a pandemic-era low. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China\u2019s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nIn a new weekly report by Factset, consensus analysts are still looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of nearly 28% for the third quarter. While a deceleration from the more than 80% growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year, that would still mark the third-highest year-over-year increase in earnings for the index since 2010. Third-quarter earnings reporting season is set to pick up next month. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* A host of news coming out of Facebook (FB) after journalists reviewed internal documents from the company. Not going to get into it here, but I recommend you check out was is going on surrounding Facebook.\n* Ford Motors (F) said it plans to boost capacity from the F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 80,000 per year thanks to strong demand, adding that the vehicle would be for sale next spring.\n* Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who has built the company into the US\u2019 most valuable chip maker, was named as one of Time Magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People. I have said this publicly multiple times, but NVDA is my single favorite stock in the entire market.\n* Lucid\u2019s (LCID) luxury sedan has received a government certification for a range of 520 miles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it\u2019s the longest range EV rated so far. For comparisons, Tesla\u2019s Model S was rated for a range of 405 miles, though it is a lot cheaper. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which operates popular dating app Tinder, said it was working on its own payment system to circumvent Apple and Google following the recent decision by US authorities to allow companies to offer third-party payment solutions within the Google and Apple app stores. \n* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) said it aims for net-zero emissions within the next 30 years. \n* Popular chatting platform Discord raised $500 million in a new founding round, bringing the value of the company to an estimated $15 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) originally tried to buy Discord many months ago, but it seems like the company is aiming to go public at some point. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $310 to $395 at Buy. Stock currently around $342\n* Adobe (ADBE) with two target raises. Stock currently around $665\n   * Barclays from $660 to $740 at Overweight\n   * BMO Capital Markets from $630 to $730 at Outperform\n* Biogen (BIIB) target raised by UBS Group from $442 to $475 at Buy. Stock currently around $300\n* Discover Financial Services (DFS) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $137 to $139 at Equal Weight\n* Fortinet (FTNT) target raised by BMO Capital Markets from $300 to $335 at Overweight. Stock currently around $305\n* Teck Resources (TECK) target raised by Deutshce Bank from $30 to $32 at Buy. Stock currently around $26\n\n\u201cA gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.\u201d - Seneca",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 17, 2021**\n\nStocks declined today, reversing from yesterday\u2019s gain given today was a quadruple witching event and market participants continue to digest a slew of new economic data and the potential implications for monetary policy. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.97% down, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.19% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.53% down. As of today\u2019s close, September is headed for its first negative month all year.\n\nToday was the quarterly quadruple witching, an event wherein individual stock options and futures, and index options and futures, all expire the same day. Typically, this event has elevated volume and volatility on the day and days leading up to it. Definitely one of the reasons for today\u2019s decline. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data.

Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nAll the recent data will factor into the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest assessment of the economy, which is set to be released next week via the meeting minutes. Market participants are anxiously waiting to see if the incoming meeting minutes have a signal regarding the timing to announce plans to begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. \n\nMark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said \u201cI think it\u2019s really a tug of war at the moment that is underway, which is to say, there\u2019s still good news on the economy. In fact, in the last two days, we've gotten some good regional Fed survey reports and today's retail sales number. But at the same time, it's in the context of this overall deceleration of growth we've seen so far in the third quarter \\[and\\] worries about the Delta variant.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment survey, sentiment improved only slightly in September after reaching its lowest level since 2011 in August. The headline index in the institution's Surveys of Consumers ticked up to 71.0 in the preliminary reading, compared to the 70.3 posted in August. Consensus economists were looking for the index to improve to 72.0 in September.\n* Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc will give a one-time bonus of $1,250 to its full-time pharmacists and a $1,000 payment to part-time pharmacists, the drugstore chain said on Friday, as major retailers try to retain people amid intense labor shortages. This is a similar effort other retailers have employed.\n* Irish regulators raised privacy concerns regarding Facebook\u2019s (FB) new smart glasses. The concern comes that people have a difficult timing  telling whether the glasses are filming or not\n* Tencent (TCEHY) opens WeChat, the super app with more than $1 billion users, to allows rivals to display their links.

        "selftext": "Stocks once again traded, mixed, this time with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly underperforming relative to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both of switch had a last minute rally to close barely on the green. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the three major indexes, rising 0.68%. Following the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole Symposium last week, market participants are anxiously waiting for the August Jobs Report, which will further illuminate the state of the labor market, a key factor in the Fed\u2019s decision-making regarding a potential taper timeline. \n\nADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the official August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.\n\nMike Loewengart, managing director of investing strategy at E-Trade Financial, wrote in a note to clients, \u201cThe private payroll numbers have been all over the map during the pandemic. But with so much pressure on improvement on the labor market front coming from the Fed, this could send a signal that jobs growth is stagnating. That\u2019s likely a good thing for the markets, though, as it means easy money policy continues.\u201d \n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d As I have said multiple times in the past, personally, I remain bullish even during tapering talk, I think the real test for equities will come when interest rate hikes start being discussed.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s drive to \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d. \n* Walmart (WMT) bumped hourly wages by $1 to an average of $16.40 an hour as the holiday season, the most important time of the year for retailers, is set to kick off.\n* Yesterday, I talked about Ford Motors (F) cutting back production due to chip shortages. Today, General Motors (GM) followed suit and announced it would be cutting production goals due to the global shortage in critical semiconductor components.\n* A Federal Judge ruled the Apple (AAPL) must face a class-action lawsuit alleging the Siri recorded private conversations due to \u201caccidental activation\u201d. \n* Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Broadcast app, a popular tool for online live-streamers is updating the app to improve noise removal, support more cameras, and reduce the amount of VRAM used by the app. A spokesperson for Nvidia said, \u201cThe new update addresses this with dedicated training sound profiles to retain that speech while removing the unwanted background noise.\u201d\n* According to Bloomberg news, Tesla (TSLA) was forced to temporarily halt operations at its Shanghai factory last months due to the global shortage of semiconductors. This is affecting car manufacturers the world over.\n* Toyota, the world\u2019s largest car manufacturer said it would slash global production for September by roughly 40%, again due to the chip shortage.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Bill.com (BILL) target raiosed by BTIG Research from $290 to $310 at Outperform.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 16, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed in a volatile session after getting a boost following the release of new economic data that showed retail sales for the month of August coming in stronger-than-expected, suggesting that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, held up despite rising coronavirus Delta variant concerns. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day with a gain of 0.07% and 0.08% respectively. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 0.17% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.17% and 0.19% down respectively. Jobless claims also came in near a pandemic-era low. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China\u2019s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nIn a new weekly report by Factset, consensus analysts are still looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of nearly 28% for the third quarter. While a deceleration from the more than 80% growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year, that would still mark the third-highest year-over-year increase in earnings for the index since 2010. Third-quarter earnings reporting season is set to pick up next month. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* A host of news coming out of Facebook (FB) after journalists reviewed internal documents from the company. Not going to get into it here, but I recommend you check out was is going on surrounding Facebook.\n* Ford Motors (F) said it plans to boost capacity from the F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 80,000 per year thanks to strong demand, adding that the vehicle would be for sale next spring.\n* Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who has built the company into the US\u2019 most valuable chip maker, was named as one of Time Magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People. I have said this publicly multiple times, but NVDA is my single favorite stock in the entire market.\n* Lucid\u2019s (LCID) luxury sedan has received a government certification for a range of 520 miles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it\u2019s the longest range EV rated so far. For comparisons, Tesla\u2019s Model S was rated for a range of 405 miles, though it is a lot cheaper. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which operates popular dating app Tinder, said it was working on its own payment system to circumvent Apple and Google following the recent decision by US authorities to allow companies to offer third-party payment solutions within the Google and Apple app stores. \n* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) said it aims for net-zero emissions within the next 30 years. \n* Popular chatting platform Discord raised $500 million in a new founding round, bringing the value of the company to an estimated $15 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) originally tried to buy Discord many months ago, but it seems like the company is aiming to go public at some point. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $310 to $395 at Buy.

Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lymm2dhxxno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92228b5de309258f52e667bf370e4ed1b6d8322e\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Hey guys, who of you do never watch porn or never go on YouTube? Well, I guess, none of you. However, 3.7 billion people do not have any access to the Internet; poor dudes no porn, and no YouTube. Well, guess what, one company will make money anyway when these guys get access to the internet, and **I am not talking about PornHub, it is Nvidia!**\n\nNvidia is developing very quickly its chips for data centers and eats Intel's market share every day. Here is why, if you are not a retarded living in a cave, you should buy Nvidia (NVDA). \n\n# Crazy quarterly results: \n\nLast quarter's results were monstrous, **bears go back in your cave!**\n\n* Revenues: $6.51 billion versus $6.33 billion expected (dumb-ass analysts were not even close). \n* Revenue growth:  68% annually after a growth of 84% last quarter (get the rocket ready). \n* Adjusted earnings: $1.04, versus $1.01 expected (analysts cannot grasp how much money it makes).\n\n**Dude, have you ever seen a company with such growth?** In comparison, Facebook with its 39% % growth year-over-year looks like a boomer company.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is why Nvidia is a cash cow for the coming years:**\n\n# Why you will make money in 1 year:\n\n\u00b7 Graphic cards (current biggest segment): **growth of 87%** to $3.91 billion. This is crazy growth, and the current valuation seems not to fully consider such growth, especially considering that it is the biggest segment of Nvidia. Nvidia has a PE of 79, it may look big, but Amazon (AMZN) has a PE of 59 and growth is tiny in comparison. Square (SQ) has a PE of more than 200.\n\n# Why you will make money in 3 years: \n\n\u00b7 Compute and network segment (chips for data centers): growth of 46% to $2.6 billion. This is crazy growth for a normal company, but it is not sufficient for Nvidia. However, the future looks sexy.\n\n\u00b7 Data are the future and companies are building data centers all the time. If Amazon invests so heavily in AWS, it is because the cloud is the future! Well, the more Amazon spends on the cloud, the more money Nvidia makes. **Demand for Nvidia chips is exploding**, especially when considering that they are way better than the one from Intel (boomers go home). The cake and the slice of the cake are growing for Nvidia and I will eat the cake as I am a shareholder!\n\n# Why you will make money in 5 years:\n\n\u00b7 Professional use: Industry will progressively get more automated and therefore needs more chips. Annually graphics cards for high-end professional workstations **went up 156% annually** to $519 million. This growth is tremendous and proves that demand is enormous. \n\n\u00b7 Secondly, its automotive business unit. Sales were up 37% from last year's respective quarter. This is poor growth (LOL) for Nvidia but the future looks awesome. If you think two seconds, you will realize that the future is not about EVs, the true revolution will be autonomous cars! And who will be the true winner? Tesla? No! Nio? No! Nvidia? Yeah boy, you got it! Considering the potential of this sector and how crazy people get \u201cjust\u201d with EVs, **Nvidia will not go to the moon but through the whole universe**, once people understand the potential of this division! \n\n# TLDR:\n\nBears have been repeating that Nvidia has been too expensive for a while. They have been repeating that it is not rational for the stock to double in 12 months and blablabla. Well, if they were not retarded, they would see that they are still **tons of catalysts** and the more time passes, the more we will use Nvidia products. So bears are gay and bulls are strong! \n\nPosition: because I do not live in a cave, I bought 50 shares, worth approximately 11,350 USD.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone. Happy Saturday and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic\u2026. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period\u2026 so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months\u2026\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs\u2026however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid\u2026.\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be\u2026however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially\u2026.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "Stock: Nvidia\n\nTicker: $NVDA\n\n**#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** \n\nTo begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, let\u2019s use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the company\u2019s average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So let\u2019s break it down\n\nEV stands for \u201cEnterprise Value\u201d. Enterprise value is made up of the company\u2019s equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the company\u2019s value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the company\u2019s shares.\n\nSo we have nvidia\u2019s equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billions) so we have the EV: 549.69B (information gathered by Merrill Lynch) \n\nNow that we have the EV, what is EBITDA? EBITDA or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization is simply putted as the measure of profitability. Like EV, its just a way of understanding a business\u2019s profitability better than net income can. Debt to Equity ratio, Free Cash Flow Yield, P/E Ratio are also helpful, but we aren\u2019t going there. \n\nFormula: So we\u2019ll take the Net Income of Nvidia which is Earnings before Interest, then we\u2019ll add interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Based off of a 10-k provided by the SEC, the Net Income: 4,332, Interest: 184, Taxes: 77, D and A: 1,098 \n\nEBITDA: 5.69B (in billions) \n\nSo we have the EV/EBITDA of 96.2 \n\nWhat do we do with this information? We can now compare it to the industry average. You\u2019re looking for them to trade underneath the average. The Software and AI EV/EBITDA average is 106, so Nvidia is trading underneath the industry average. \n\n**Historical Price Target(s) + Business Fundamentals (Fundamental Analysis)**\n\nBefore Nvidia\u2019s stock split (4:1) Nvidia was trading at a high of $750+. While considering we are in an eight year exponential tech bull run, I still think Nvidia was room to run back to close or even as high as its prior high. \n\nTesla stock was trading at around $2,213 before their split of 5:1. Then Tesla ran from $80 to almost $900 in a single year. Of course that was attributed to the bull run/short squeeze, but for Nvidia that could mean something. For Tesla to 10x in a year, isn\u2019t hard for nvidia to 2x or even 3x from its current trading price based on their prior movements. Tesla\u2019s 5 year gain in percentages is 1,838% while Nvidias 5 year gain is 1.401%. Their historical price movement is very similar so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising is nvidia followed Tesla on a smaller, slower scale. \n\nBesides that, Nvidias business is huge for the retail consumption. Bitcoin miners and Gamers have been on a ramped uptrend for the past years and is ever growing. The main graphics card usage is for gamers and miners. So the disruption of graphics card and the demand will be huge for the foreseeable future. \n\n**#2: Technical Analysis** \n\nMany people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn\u2019t as black and white, but that\u2019s the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\nDaily Chart: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vr59jzomlem71.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae2c94fb51a51e4509d8496371b90d9783f8ef30\n\nI can see Nvidia moving in two different ways within the next few weeks.\n\nOption A: We see nvidia break the flag and break above the all time high of $230 and make a new high\n\nOr Option B: We get rejected off the all time high or fail the break out and head down to the $206-207 support.\n\nBut Nvidia isn\u2019t a short term play, Tesla took a year to 10x so this is definitely a 1-3 year play at least. \n\n**How I\u2019m playing Nvidia**\n\nYes, I\u2019m in nvidia. I wanted to make this so I can get criticism on my first Due Diligence and what I can fix or what I can add. I know this is super choppy and all over the place and I\u2019m sure I missed more important things, but this is where I\u2019m starting.\n\nI have 20% of my portfolio allocated to Nvidia. 12% in shares and 8% in long ATM calls dating in 2023. \n\nPrice Target: $300-$500+ depending on how fast the stock grows. \n\nPlease critique this as I only want to grow as an investor, but please keep the roasting to a minimum :D",

        "selftext": "NVDA and GOOG/GOOGL are both amongst the top 10 market capped stocks in the American sp500. They also are both more or less are tech sector. They\u2019re similar in these regards. NVDA did a stock split when their base 1 share price got around 850ish 7 for 1 split. NVDA has outperformed GOOGL on a harder rally YTD, in part due to second leg up shortly after a share split. It\u2019s no secret the modern stock market is going through records options activity as well as record amounts of retail buying in. More liquid stock as well as cheaper stock price via split can alleviate the cost of writing 1 options contract since options are inherently a contract regarding 100 shares of the underlying security. I honestly think the split has helped NVDA rally since retail investors who liked NVDA now had access to cheaper option contracts through stock corporate action.

AEye\u2019s iDAR\u2122 (Intelligent Detection and Ranging) system leverages biomimicry and principles from automated targeting applications used by the military to scan the environment, intelligently focusing on what matters most, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception. iDAR is the **ONLY software configurable LiDAR** (YOU READ THAT RIGHT) with integrated deterministic artificial intelligence, delivering industry-leading performance in range, resolution, and speed. The company was founded in 2013 and is based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*The company has recently announced technology and/or manufacturing partnerships with **NVIDIA, Sanmina, Continental, Benchmark, and TuSimple**, as well as its expansion into the **Japanese and Korean markets as it prepares for volume production.**\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Luminar $LAZR, LIDR\u2019s current competitor. Luminar has a market cap of 5.86 billion as of today. That is almost 4x what LIDR is at right now.\n\n**Ape's instinct kicked in:**\n\nOkay I know this is retarded. You know what Luminar does? THEY MANUFACTURE LIDAR. What does this have to do with LIDR? LIDR manufactures LIDAR too.

While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, **AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture**. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its [industry-leading range](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aeye.ai%2Fpress%2Fvsi-issues-independent-report-verifying-aeye-lidar-performance%2F&amp;esheet=52494954&amp;newsitemid=20210921005466&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=industry-leading+range&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f27492b3807e03e72c27093bbea60d99), resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence.\u201d\n\nAEye\u2019s patent portfolio can generally be organized into four groups:\n\n**1. Intelligent Modular Architecture**\n\nThis group of patents relate to AEye\u2019s intelligent modular bistatic architecture, system design, and its solid-state performing MEMs-based agile LiDAR. While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its industry-leading range, resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence. Equally important, AEye\u2019s design allows for flexibility in hardware packaging and vehicle placement options, unlike some LiDAR sensors that are limited to roof placement. These patents include protection of the overall architecture, of feedback techniques to keep the scanning where desired during vehicle vibration and temperature variation, as well as the ability to control detection pulse width and receiver bandwidth.\n\n**2. Open System and Extended Data Capabilities**\n\nA second group of patents focus on AEye\u2019s software definable AI technology and iDAR\u2019s ability to integrate other existing sensors, such as radar, cameras, and IMUs. These patents address AEye\u2019s unique co-boresighted design, wherein an HD camera and LiDAR receiver share the same optical axis, creating true color point clouds which enhance classification capabilities and eliminate the need for post-processing parallax correction. By co-boresighting the camera with the LiDAR receiver, AEye moves intelligence into the sensor. This enables the sensor to detect and immediately request additional data about objects and anomalies, then issue \"fast path\" priority message alerts to inform the motion planning system. By pushing detected threats to the top of the data stack under consideration by the motion planning system, AEye reduces central processing burdens, and speeds time to reaction.\n\n**3. Enhanced Data Quality**\n\nThe third group encompasses innovative features such as scan agility, which enables the sensor to \"acquire\" pre-classification attributes useful in accelerating perception systems. For example, AEye is able to pinpoint intra frame velocity by capturing both radial and lateral velocity, where most threats occur while driving. These patents build a software-defined layer upon the bistatic platform, and include the ability to optimize shot lists as a function of scenes and environment, novel tracking schemes, and tracking the horizon during car motion. The latter is an important aspect of agility and intelligence, as it reduces the required vertical scan field of view, and therefore reduces frame to frame time. iDAR\u2019s ability to enable software-defined frames and dynamic scan patterns and the platform\u2019s ability to deploy adaptive energy control on a pulse-by-pulse basis enables both the dynamic adjustment of scan patterns and the ability to adapt the laser energy for each pulse for complete interference mitigation.\n\n**4. Optical Data Networking**\n\nThe fourth group enables AEye to expand the capabilities of the AEye sensor to enable the laser to communicate information. This groundbreaking feature is uniquely enabled by AEye\u2019s adaptive LiDAR, in which the laser can be directed with precision. Pulsed message packets enable data to be transferred via line-of-sight. By using optical communications via the LiDAR system, AEye sensors can leverage a readily available, secure and reliable communications channel, which does not compete with the congested bandwidth of WiFi, cellular, and/or satellite communications, to transmit, receive, and/or transceive data.\n\n\"We set out to build a flexible architecture that could be expanded and adapted over time, adding new innovations. Our IP strategy, we believe, places us years ahead of others building single use hardware,\" said Dr. Allan Steinhardt, chief scientist at AEye. \"We will continue to push forward aggressively with developing and protecting competitive intellectual property to advance AEye\u2019s technological leadership. We are creating a thorough and rigorously defensible patent portfolio covering the architecture and software that underlie our solution.\"",

        "selftext": " \n\nFirst things first, Consumer price  index data finally came slightly lower then expected 5.3 vs the 5.4 , honestly the nail on the coffin for the inflation scare will be with Octobers consumer price index data , if it shows a staling in inflation or even some deflation in some items , the transitory theory that jpow has been talking about for the past few months will be proven true. Furthermore , a lot of the inflation is due to supply chains issues aka transitory aka this shit isnt forever . Honestly by 2023 i think supply chains should be solved ... hopefully maybe not all but a good portion.\n\nThe delta strain , caused a little bit of a fuck up which the market priced in relatively quick, if Im being honest , idk what to say about covid one day we are like 250K+ the next we are up 70k+ . I hope we hit a peak already and are now going back down but who knows with the holidays and flu season around the corner .\n\nSo this is just my view and what ill be planning on doing ,\n\nFirst off, spys been selling off since last week , honestly its been a slow bleed all the way down to the 50ma, Im really expecting a bounce around there any time now . Im bearish on spy for the rest of this week because well, the ex dividend date is this Friday 9/17/2021. So chance on spy hitting any new highs this week are out of the equation. Also im just expecting a sell off for the rest of week maybe either tomo or Thursday a little pump but really not expecting much as it heads off to its ex dividend date.\n\nIll probably scalp puts, not sure which strike yet because idk what spys price will be these next 2 days.\n\nA lot of people are talking about a market having a crash or something coming and to them , all ill say is , put your money where your mouth is, right now is just a buying opportunity in my eyes ( for me im waiting for a little bit more of a dip , before buying some calls , but i am starting to sell dec puts for fb, and nvidia )\n\nI think what the market is doing right now is well... listening to jpow and understanding that he was right... \" economy open inflation go big, spending go big then stop , slow growth realization, market back to normal.\"\n\nEconomy opened and sure enough consumer price index came in hot which was expected , low supply , high demand, then it was followed by stellar earnings because well stimulus people stimulus. People still had that federal boost and all of that other stuff now that stimulus is gone , the market is figuring out that \"oh shit, everythings not going to grow as much because people arent spending as much and stimulus ended.\" Thats what i think is getting priced in now and why stocks are dropping right now .\n\nIf anything , this pain will start ending this friday ( ex dividend for spy so that itself is the last negative catalyst and it will probably finally hit the 50 ma 441 maybe a little lower but should start some kind of rebound. Then next week we have the fomc meeting where jpow will grab all the bears by the balls and say we will not taper until later which will cause the start of the next rally which will go into q3 earnings which will probably destroy expectations since we still had stimi cash , and if congress passes this new bill aka the 3 trilli bill then ladies and gentlemen q4 will be sexy asf . Which is followed by a wtf we doing in 2022 but hey , enjoy the moment guys !\n\nGo ahead and share your thoughts im all ears !",

        "selftext": "NOTE: I know this is a long question and i really appreciate anyone taking the time to read it and offer their advice. \n\nSo, to my question:\n\nHaving recently put my military career behind me, and starting to look to the future, i began learning about investing about a year ago. Starting slow, i leaned heavily on the advise of The Motley Fool, Cathie Woods &amp; Warren Buffett. I figured mimicking successful investors was a good way to minimize losses. \n\nBut thanks to a healthy dose of FOMO, in January I got swept up in the GME/AMC fever and lost about $3K. I know that's not much to most of you, but it was enough for me to become much more reserved in my investing choices. \n\nSo now i hold a variety of stocks, spread across roughly 25 different stocks from Palantir, Plug Power and Tesla, all the way to Nvidia, Bank of America, Master Card and Coke A Cola. Each in varying amounts from $50 to $500. \n\nWith X Dividend dates quickly approaching, i was looking into investing in dividend stocks to start building an independent source of revenue (yes, i know I'll need to invest much more in order to achieve this), and it was suggested to me that i consolidate my investments into a single stock with a strong history of consistent dividend payments and consistent annual increases in dividend percentages paid out, such as Abbott, Brookfield Renewable and Johnson &amp; Johnson. \n\nSo here's my question.....\n\nWhat would you advise an investor like me to do? Should i continue to keep my investments spread out, increasing the value with regular incremental contributions? Or should I sell them and consolidate the roughly $2500 that isn't currently in the red in crypto investing, and putting it into a high yield dividend stock, to maximize dividend payments that i can use to reinvest and increase my investing value? And if so, which dividend stock would you suggest? \n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this and offer your advice, it's greatly appreciate.",

AI at its finest.\n\nThe stock had earlier mishaps due to a disgruntled partner. He is now completely out of the company. For approximately a year now he was driving the stock price down. He had 43,000,000 shares and. Sold them off for whatever market price was driving the stock into the ground. During that year someone was privately purchasing 1,000,000 shares at various intervals but most were sold at market price.\n\nIts time we take another look at this company. They have been awarded a couple patents in the last couple months and have more pending. \n\nLG is integrating their product into their phones. Pristine surgical a startup company is utilizing NexOptic technology in single use camera systems.\n\nNexOptic has some real potential for a breakout.\n\nI am holding 5000 shares.\n\nJust reported new - their ALIIS is 100x faster at vehicle identification.

In today\u2019s issue we will be putting retail grocery giant Kroger ($KR) under the gun, to see if the company\u2019s turbulent news conversation of the past month can provide any insight into their upcoming Q2 earnings release, scheduled for Friday, September 10th. As always, please like or comment if you enjoyed the report or have any questions, and be sure to subscribe to stay up-to-date on all our stock market news sentiment discoveries:*\n\n**1. Introduction to Kroger Co. ($KR) \ud83d\uded2**\n\nOver the past few years, the retail grocery landscape has evolved dramatically \u2014 brick and mortar giants like Walmart, Target, and Costco have stepped up their game and begun providing more online, delivery, and pick-up options, while online retailers Amazon, Instacart, and the like have swooped in from the other side of the spectrum with gig delivery drivers and employee-less brick and mortar locations of their own.\n\n  \nWith all of this excitement and novelty blossoming in the industry, one might be surprised to hear that a traditional supermarket chain like Kroger has been one of the hottest stocks of the bunch over the past year, shooting up 50% in recent months to a new all-time high stock price heading into earnings tomorrow (see below). The stock has benefited handsomely from the work from home COVID-economy of the past year and change, and with food inflation and emerging technology disrupting the industry currently, has managed to compete with the bigger fish in the pool for the time being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dm1caa2o55n71.png?width=2222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90e4cb311a810b838edfa7fc5114663ee29be764\n\nFollowing along with its upward trend in price, Kroger has quickly become one of the most talked-about tickers in stock market news coverage, and a polarizing one at that.\u00a0**Over the month of August, $KR received more headlines than 89% of all stock tickers**, ranking third in its peer group (behind Amazon $AMZN and Walmart $WMT) \u2014 of these headlines, approximately 43% have leaned optimistically and 48% have leaned pessimistically in terms of sentiment expressed about Kroger as a company, with the remaining 9% being considered \u201cneutral\u201d sentiment; this is one of the lowest neutrality rates on the market.\n\n  \nWhile some analysts and investors say its flowing consistency in profitability make it a great value stock to buy and hold (and potentially even a good hedge against food inflation compared to others), some say the all-time high price is a blinding sign of $KR being overbought and oversold \u2014\u00a0*no one*\u00a0seems to agree on which of the two is actually the case. The two articles below (published on the same day this week) argue both sides of the coin, and it\u2019s almost funny how opposite the two are in their theses of what to expect from the stock:\n\nThis leaves one big question:\u00a0**is Kroger overhyped in news conversation, or ripe to be sniped before its earnings are released tomorrow?**\u00a0We\u2019ll spend the remaining two sections diving into what we think the answer is, and what you should do after tomorrow\u2019s earnings.  \n\n\n**2. $KR News Events and Headlines**\n\nOver the past 90 days, Kroger has appeared in just over 300 unique finance article headlines, well above average for a company of its size and reputation.\u00a0**Much of the conversation has centered around the company\u2019s managerial operations of late, including some controversial ones**, like its decision to cut expenses by closing stores in Long Beach and Seattle when both cities started enforcing mandated pandemic pay increases for employees during the early months of 2021, or its election of Former US Labor Secretary (and wife of Mitch McConnell) Elaine Chao to its board of directors \u2014 both of which sparked outrage on Twitter and literal boycotts of their stores.\n\nSome sparse but more optimistic headlines as of late include the company\u2019s previous earnings report, in which it increased its full-year guidance and announced a $1 billion stock buy-back program (despite missing on consensus EPS and revenue forecasts). Following earnings, a 13F report revealed that Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK) CEO Warren Buffett bought nearly 11-million shares of Kroger last quarter. The summarized timeline of crucial $KR news events so far this year:\n\n1. **February 2nd:**\u00a0[Kroger closes 2 Long Beach stores following city-mandated pandemic pay increase](http://kroger%20to%20close%202%20long%20beach%20stores%20following%20city-mandated%20pandemic%20pay%20increase/?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\n2. **June 17th:**\u00a0[Q1 Earnings Report \u2014 $KR raises full year guidance and announces $1 billion share buyback program](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kroger-raises-full-year-guidance-announces-1-billion-share-buyback-program-2021-06-17?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\n3. **August 2nd:**\u00a0[Kroger elects Elaine Chao to its Board of Directors](https://ir.kroger.com/CorporateProfile/press-releases/press-release/2021/Kroger-Elects-Elaine-Chao-to-Board-of-Directors/default.aspx?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\n4. **August 16th:** [Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway adds a significant stake in Kroger stock.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-buys-kroger-cuts-stakes-in-drug-makers-01629155643?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\n5. **September 5th:**\u00a0[$KR stock reaches a new all-time high price of $47.31 ahead of earnings](https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2021/09/07/kroger-stock-jumps-to-all-time-high.html?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\n\n**Top $KR Headlines by Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0**\n\nOf the articles published about Kroger in recent months, many have been either highly optimistic, pessimistic, speculative (ie. future-tense), and reactive (ie. past-tense) in their sentiment expression of $KR. Here are the top articles scored across each of these metrics from the past two months:\n\n**Most Optimistic Article:**  \n[**Warren Buffett Bucks Wall Street by Adding More Kroger Stock to His Portfolio**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffett-bucks-wall-street-with-kroger-stock-pick-11629222060?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\u00a0**| Market Watch 8/17/21 (optimism score: 87%)**  \n**Most Pessimistic Article:**  \n[**Why Customers Are Furious With Kroger And Boycotting Its Stores: \u2018This Is The Last Straw\u2019**](https://www.ibtimes.com/why-customers-are-furious-kroger-boycotting-its-stores-last-straw-3267450?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\u00a0**| Benzinga 8/5/21 (pessimism score: 95%)**  \n**Most SpeculativeArticle:**  \n[**What\u2019s Next for Kroger Stock\u2019\u2018s Recent Rally?**](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/analysis/2021/08/02/after-reaching-recent-highs-whats-next-for-kroger-stock?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\u00a0**| Schaefer Research 8/2/21 (speculation score: 72%)**  \n**Most Reactive Article:**  \n[**Kroger Named Winsight Grocery Business of the Year**](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/kroger-earns-winsight-grocery-business-year-honors?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#:~:text=The%20global%20coronavirus%20pandemic%20tested,workers%20and%20customers%20in%20danger.)\u00a0**| Windsight Grocery Business 8/11/21 (reaction score: 67%)**  \n**2. $KR News Sentiment vs. Price**\n\n**Over the past month, $KR stock price and news sentiment have shown a -0.42 correlation (which is notably negative).**\u00a0As mentioned, Kroger has been one of the most profitable stocks in the retail grocery business of the past year, and the stock market has reflected this EPS almost perfectly, rising 43.57% so far in 2021, and 7.83% in the past month alone. However, over the same period,\u00a0**while stock price has gone up and up, the stock\u2019s conversation in news coverage has taken a dramatic shift towards highly negative conversation overall.**\u00a0Since the start of August, the vast majority of articles written about $KR have been written with pessimistic expression. Many of these articles have highlighted the pessimistic events mentioned above, while some yet focus on the stock\u2019s all-time high price saying that a post-earnings \u201csell the news\u201d dip is inevitable. Kroger\u2019s stock price vs. average daily news sentiment is shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nuilidm565n71.png?width=924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=800bd25e47f695b4760950d1593e91f69ce87b2a\n\nOften times it is the case that a stock\u2019s news coverage trails its price performance by days or even weeks. However on other occasions \u2014 especially when enough highly impactful news events are stringed together in succession \u2014 the news actually has the potential to influence the price performance in return. Kroger\u2019s recently pessimistic news sentiment may prove to be enough to swing the price pendulum the other direction, especially if its Q2 Earnings Report is as lackluster as could be expected from articles such as\u00a0[this](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/08/kroger-earnings-what-to-watch-on-friday/?utm_campaign=Market%20Mood%2C%20from%20Babbl%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).\n\n**3. Kroger Hype-or-Snipe Rating**\n\n**Given the current all-time high price of $KR heading into tomorrow\u2019s earnings, along with the recent string of significant pessimism expressed in $KR news coverage, our algorithms give $KR a Hype-or-Snipe rating of -0.68.**\u00a0On a scale from -1.00 (being extremely overhyped price) and +1.00 (being extremely underhyped price), this means that $KR stock is currently highly overhyped and poorly reflected in the news, signaling the considerable potential for a correction in stock price following tomorrow morning\u2019s earnings (read our first $NVDA sentiment spotlight for a full description of our Hype-or-Snipe Rating).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6kpxbwqa65n71.png?width=2167&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df8b006777bb81375fbcb52aa1f7e36abd0d30df\n\nThough it feels a bit weird to be betting the flip side of the coin as the great Warren Buffett, keep in mind that he makes his bets on the long term time horizon (despite the fact that he literally just turned 91) \u2014 whereas this rating indicates adverse news coverage vs. stock price correlation into the short-term (ie. &lt;3 months). While the momentum as of late has definitely swung under the line of healthy criticism, the caveat is that it only takes a few highly positive news events to swing the pendulum in the optimistic direction. While Kroger\u2019s earnings tomorrow will likely be an improvement from the underperforming numbers released last quarter, I don\u2019t expect them to be enough to move the ball in the opposite direction. That\u2019s it for today\u2019s spotlight report, let us know what you think below, thanks for reading! \ud83d\ude4f",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 17, 2021**\n\nStocks declined today, reversing from yesterday\u2019s gain given today was a quadruple witching event and market participants continue to digest a slew of new economic data and the potential implications for monetary policy. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.97% down, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.19% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.53% down. As of today\u2019s close, September is headed for its first negative month all year.\n\nToday was the quarterly quadruple witching, an event wherein individual stock options and futures, and index options and futures, all expire the same day. Typically, this event has elevated volume and volatility on the day and days leading up to it. Definitely one of the reasons for today\u2019s decline. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China\u2019s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nAll the recent data will factor into the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest assessment of the economy, which is set to be released next week via the meeting minutes. Market participants are anxiously waiting to see if the incoming meeting minutes have a signal regarding the timing to announce plans to begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. \n\nMark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said \u201cI think it\u2019s really a tug of war at the moment that is underway, which is to say, there\u2019s still good news on the economy. In fact, in the last two days, we've gotten some good regional Fed survey reports and today's retail sales number. But at the same time, it's in the context of this overall deceleration of growth we've seen so far in the third quarter \\[and\\] worries about the Delta variant.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment survey, sentiment improved only slightly in September after reaching its lowest level since 2011 in August. The headline index in the institution's Surveys of Consumers ticked up to 71.0 in the preliminary reading, compared to the 70.3 posted in August. Consensus economists were looking for the index to improve to 72.0 in September.\n* Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc will give a one-time bonus of $1,250 to its full-time pharmacists and a $1,000 payment to part-time pharmacists, the drugstore chain said on Friday, as major retailers try to retain people amid intense labor shortages. This is a similar effort other retailers have employed.\n* Irish regulators raised privacy concerns regarding Facebook\u2019s (FB) new smart glasses. The concern comes that people have a difficult timing  telling whether the glasses are filming or not\n* Tencent (TCEHY) opens WeChat, the super app with more than $1 billion users, to allows rivals to display their links. This comes after Chinese regulators banned the practice of Chinese tech companies banning links to rivals within their platforms\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) target raised by Cowen from $!65 to $200 at Outperform. Stock currently around $174\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Barclays from $320 to $330 at Overweight. Stock currently around $260\n* Datadog (DDOG) target raised by Barclays from $156 to $180 at Overweight. Stock currently around $143\n* Facebook (FB) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $425 to $450 at Buy. Stock currently around $364\n* Alphabet (GOOGL) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $3150 to $3325 at Buy. Stock currently around $2815\n* Lululemon (LULU) target raised by Oppenheimer from $405 to $520 at Outperform. Stock currently around $427\n* Microsoft (MSFT) target raised by Barclays from $$330 to $345 at Overweight. Stock currently around $300\n* ServiceNow (NOW) target raised by Barclays from $667 to $784 at Overweight. Stock currently around $650\n* Nvidia (NVDA) target raised by Bank of America from $260 to $275 at Buy. Stock currently around $218\n* On Semiconductors (ON) target raised by Bank of America from $55 to $60 at Buy. Stock currently around $49\n\n\u201cTo bear trials with a calm mind robs misfortune of its strength and burden.\u201d - Seneca",

        "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\n* Affirm is a major player in the booming \u201cpoint of sale financing\u201d or \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d niche.\n* Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout.\n* The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast.\n* Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target.\n\n**What they do:**\n\nAffirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan.  \n \n\nAffirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer\u2019s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders.  \n \n\nAffirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service.  \n \n\nThere were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion.  \n \n\nAffirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants.  \n \n\nShopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries.  \n \n\nAffirm\u2019s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base.\n\n**Why they\u2019re spiking in interest:**  \n \n\nReddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period.  \n \n\nThe surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada.  \n \n\nThat announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news.  \n \n\nThe Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.  \n \n\nThere has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system.  \n \n\nShopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm.  \n \n\nNotable comments from Reddit:  \n \n\n\"I\u2019m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you\u2019ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it\u2019s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or \u201cGreen Sky\u201d to open up to home and auto loans.\"\n\n\\- PinBot1138  \n \n\n\u201cPeople should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.\u201d  \n \\- Lukebreit  \n \n\nSignal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares.\n\n \n\n**Why $AFRM could be valuable:**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMcKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he\u2019s one of the founders of PayPal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm\u2019s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSix of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it \u201cBuy\u201d, with the other 4 placing it at \u201cHold\u201d. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPost-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What the risks are:**\n\nAffirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern.  \n \n\nAffirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector\u2019s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm.  \n \n\nAffirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company\u2019s results.  \n \n\nAffirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Company\u2019s gross merchandise volume and increase default rates.  \n \n\nThe buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price.  \n \n\n***Bottom line:***\u00a0*Affirm\u2019s lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth. Watch for the release of Q4 and full FY 2021 results, scheduled for Sept. 9.*",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed for 4 months BUT \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[COIN Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x6qvq5tiuvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eec4721d35b1315ec0be5e51129e93926fc00f)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not currently in a position but considering loading the $300 calls exp dec 21",

        "selftext": "Just wondering what people's thoughts are on Affirm earning's on Sep 9th? \n\nSome things I've been considering...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. There is a possibility that earnings could miss estimates... even though they estimated low, around 225 M for this quarter. This would be due to Peloton shitting the bed. Before the Amazon deal... Peloton was Affirm's largest customer. The Peloton collapse will affect Affirm.\n2. According to a Simply Wall Street article anything below $270 M will not be seen by the street as a surprise. So if Affirm beats... it has to be substantial.\n3. So much depends on the guidance they will offer and more info about the Amazon deal. I'd like to see what they predict. I believe the guidance regarding this will determine whether or not the SP rises or sinks. Amazon is a monster... and this deal was huge for Affirm.\n4. It will be really interesting to see Apple's performance in Canada with PayBright. A company that Affirm acquired. I called my local Apple store (in Canada) and spoke with sales supervisor. They told me approximately 2/10 purchases are funded via Paybright! Anecdotal yes... small sample size.. yes... but you can extrapolate this... something to think about.\n5. There is a lot of momentum in this space. We saw this with SQ's all stock offering worth 29 B for After pay.\n6. Affirm has been in business since 2012. Think about all that data and analysis they have collected on borrowers! That's a gold mine and in this day and age data analytics is everything. \n7. Which leads me to potential suitors for Affirm... Apple, Shopify, Amazon, WallMArt... hell I bet even JPM is interested. Considering traditional banking will be taken to the cleaners if they don't do anything... soon. My money is on Shop to take them out as they own 8% already.\n8. Max Levchin the CEO is switched on. He's been here before and can execute. Just look at PayPal.\n\nSo your turn... what do you think?\n\nFull disclosure... 23 calls. Nov $70's and Jan $85's.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 8, 2021**\n\n*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "Living in today\u2019s word is quite different than growing up in the 80s. For example you can find a job by picking up your phone and possibly be at work within the same day or even hours. If you want to know where a friend or loved one is you do not have to go looking for them or wait until you know they are going to be home you can simply look at their location, and if you need to talk to them you don\u2019t have to go through an operator you can simply just call or text them. Today the amount of work abundance and money making opportunities is honestly quite incredible. But what about money, there was no e-currency or tokens back then, heck the only thing there was were stocks, gold and money. As time went on we started seeing the internet come out and with that is when the e-currencies started being developed like PayPal and such. Now we are developing into a time where your cash is starting to become annoying and the governance of a currency is becoming more widespread known as fraud money. My point is that over a period of only 40 years or so, we have evolved passed using certain pieces of technologies and other every day items that at the time we thought we would never be able to live without, but as time went on these objects became obsolete and other newer, more efficient objects are now the new normal. I believe this is the way the new currency is moving into our world, just in an even expedited manner. Only time will tell though.",

It is now trading at year to date lows and offers significant value upside to patient investors. Following are the highlights from Opera\u2019s Q2 \u201921 results.\n\n* 87% QoQ Revenue Growth to $60.2M \u2014 A beat by $4.1M(7% beat to midpoint)\n* 17% sequential increase in revenue \u2014 Largest increase since going public\n* Breakeven adjusted EBITDA\n* 95% gross margin\n* 49% sequential increase in Opera News revenue\n* Increased FY \u201921 revenue guidance 2nd time this year to $242-247M ( 48% YoY growth at midpoint)\n* Adjusted EBITDA FY \u201921 guidance of $10-$20M\n* Cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities of \\~$200M\n* After Seeing good results, reiterated plans to continue investing AEBITDA growth into growth objectives of growing Opera News in Western markets, scaling Dify in additional geographies and new products, and investing in the Opera Gaming division.\n\n**Opera By the Numbers**\n\nI am using data from 2020 Annual filing(20-F) and the most recent monetization of Opera's 29% preferred shares to make the case on how undervalued Opera is and how market is not giving any valuation to Opera's core business which is generating $245M of annual revenue(FY' 21 estimated) and aggressively investing for future growth by plowing all adjusted EBITDA growth from FY' 20 to expand into new verticals and geographies.\n\n* Market Cap: \\~$1B\n   * Cash, cash equivalent &amp; marketable securities : \\~$200M\n   * Book value of starmaker(35% discount/DLOM) : $55M\n   * Book value of Nanobank : $266M\n   * Book value of Opay(15% discount/DLOM) : $49M\n* Opera Core= 1$B - $200M - $370M = $430M\n   * Opera GM = 95%\n   * Opera's AEBITDA Goal = 25%-30% of revenue\n      * Proved from Q4'20 results that they can operate at 28% AEBITDA margin\n      * Opera's FY'21 Investments - All adjusted EBITDA growth in FY '21 is invested back in business to expand in Europe and N. America\n* Opera FY' 21 Forecast(high end) - $247M revenue, $20M AEBITDA\n   * **Trading at \\~1.7 x FY'21 Est. Revenue**\n\n**The recent $400M Opay funding round from Softbank at $2B valuation and subsequent monetization of 29% of Opera's preferred share in OPay at $50M shows how undervalued Opera minority investments are on the books**.\n\n* Opay is valued at \\~$2B post money, and although Opera has not officially disclosed its latest stake, as per my calculations, Opera\u2019 stake of 13.1%(10.24% Preferred shares + 2.86% Ordinary shares) got diluted to \\~10.5% after the latest $400M funding round from Softbank. Since then, Opera sold 29% of its preferred shares, its latest stake dropped to \\~8% which is now worth \\~$160M compared to $49M which they have on the books.\n* Starmaker\u2019s 19.6% stake is valued on the books at $55M valuing starmaker at \\~$280M. Similar to Opay, Starmaker,  which is profitable and has Q1 FY '21 revenue run rate of \\~$180M -- 41% sequential increase from $127M run rate at end of 2020 -- , is valued on Opera\u2019s book at massive discount.\n* Nanobank, where Opera has 42% stake and valued on books at $266M,  has been sequentially growing at 10-15% since its covid bottom and should reach pre-covid run rate of $120M during Q1 2022.\n\nWhichever multiple one is comfortable with for Opera Core business, which has gross margins of 95% with 25-30% AEBITDA margin profile, growing at 48% YoY in FY'21 and should continue to grow between 20-25% for next several years due to investments into growing new legs in fintech/cashback and gaming and also expanding in Europe and America where advertising impression are 10x better monetized compared to Africa and Asia, where majority of its 400M users are currently located, it is hard not to see how undervalued Opera is.\n\n* If you use 4x revenue multiple with the book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~1.6B ( \\~$15 per ADS) -- 66% appreciation potential based on $9 SP.\n* If you use 6x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~2.1B ( \\~20 per ADS) --122% Appreciation potential\n* If you use 8x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~2.6B ( \\~25 per ADS) -- 177% Appreciation potential\n* If you start applying growth multiples to Opera with the assumption that Opera can grow faster than 20-25% with modest success in Gaming and Fintech initiatives and get to 20-30% AEBITDA margin profile by FY\u201923, you can assign a 10x-12x revenue multiple to Opera and valuation would be much higher.\n\n**Opera History**\n\nOpera Ltd, the Opera browser company, was established in Norway in 1996  and is one of the few survivors from the Internet Explorer era of early 2000 . It was bought by a consortium led by Yahui Zhou in 2016 for $600M. In 2018, It was listed on Nasdaq as OPRA.\n\nNow, Opera is no longer just a browser company. In fact, its core browser business only contributes about half of its revenue through search and ad monetization. The other half of revenue is contributed by advertising, mostly via its Opera news app which is now a top 10 news app on both android and iOS in all of Africa, Germany, France, UK and now in the US. What Opera has done successfully is to take its browser user base of 300 million MAUs and then get them to other services like News, Fintech and Gaming. Opera calls it Browser+ strategy.\n\nIt also used its browser user base to spin off 2 very successful businesses:\n\n* OPay, a leading mobile wallet and mobile money operator in Nigeria where it had 13.1% stake(as of FY\u2019 20) which most recently raised $400M at $2B valuation.\n* Nanobank, a micro credit provider in emerging markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America where it has 42% stake. Nanobank was doing $117M quarterly revenue at 30% AEBITDA margin pre-covid, but it is still recovering from covid impact in its biggest market - India and had Q2' 21 revenue of $57M at \\~3% AEBITDA margin. Opera merged its fintech business in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank with 42% stake in August 2020.\n\nIt also opportunistically invested $30M for 19.35% stake in starmaker -- a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists -- and is growing like a wildfire, 250% YoY growth to $180M run rate in Q1' 21 with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M revenue run rate in Q4'20.\n\n**Opera Products**\n\n**Opera browser :** Amongst the giants, Apple Safari and Google Chrome, Opera has built a niche and cult following of users who like Opera browser for many of its differentiated features - Integrated Messaging apps, Integrated music players, built in VPN, ad blocker and many more. Opera browser for desktop is available on  MacOS, Windows and Linux and has seen install base growing from 42 million MAUs in 2016 to 80 million MAUs in 2020, a CAGR of 17%. Opera Mobile browser and its data saving browser Opera Mini, have grown from 164 million to 190 million MAUs, a CAGR of 4%.\n\n**Opera GX :** Opera GX, the gaming browser which Opera launched for Gamers with differentiated features like CPU and RAM limiter, Gaming aesthetics, discord integration and Gaming corner which surfaces deals and news related to Games. Since its launch in June 2019, It has grown to over 10 million MAUs in just over 2 years.\n\n**Opera News App :** Opera News is AI based News aggregator which personalizes the news based on their browsing history. It is #1 news app in all of the major African economies  - Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana. Since its launch in Germany, France, UK and US in Q4'20, It has become #1 or #2 news apps in Germany, France and the UK and in the top 10 in the US. It has grown at 42% CAGR -- from 72 million MAUs in Q4'17 to 211 million MAU in Q4'20 and is growing revenue at 160% YoY as of Q4'20.\n\n**Opera Ad Network :** Opera is one of the top 10 publishers of media impression given its scale in browser and its news app. Instead of relying on 3rd party ad networks, Opera has launched its own ad network, primarily to serve its own ad inventory and since its launch 2 years ago, it has grown at 130% YoY. It is tracking to $80 million in FY'21 revenue, 50% growth in daily revenue run rate year to date.\n\n**Dify :** Opera acquired 2 small companies in 2020 - Pocosys and Fjord bank and used Pocosys to build a new fintech product called Dify which was launched in Spain in Feb '21. Initially Dify will provide an integrated mobile wallet, Debit Card and Cashback for its users with plans to launch additional services like BNPL/Credit and fractionalized share investing to its 50M active users in Europe.\n\n**Opera Gaming :** Early 2021, Opera acquired leading 2D gaming engine company, YoYo Games and launched a Gaming division combining it with its gaming focused browser Opera GX, which has grown quite rapidly to 10M active users since its launch in June 2019. Opera plans to build a gaming community around these 10M+ users and its thousands of GameMaker developers and has plans to launch a steam like service --Gamebox-- to offer gaming publishers a platform to monetize their games.\n\n**Business Model**\n\n* **Search revenue :** Opera primarily makes money from its 80 million desktop MAUs when they conduct searches from its search bar.  Opera has revenue sharing contracts with Google and Yandex.\n* **Advertising revenue :**  Opera makes advertising revenue 2 ways:\n   * Revenue shares from book marked link, speed dials and other forms of affiliate advertising on its browser. Each million Opera GX users bring $2.8M in yearly revenue and Opera is in early innings of monetizing this gaming user base.\n   * Native advertising in its Opera News App, growing at 160% YoY.\n* **Other revenue :** This low margin revenue comes from providing professional services to Opay. This is being phased out completely by FY'21 as Opay has scaled its operation with its own staff.\n\n**Financials**\n\nOpera Search and Advertising revenue have grown at \\~22% CAGR, from $33.5M in Q2' 18 to $60.2M in Q2' 21. This revenue comes at \\~95% gross margin and has AEBITDA margin profile of 20-30%. Opera has been investing for growth so it's AEBITDA margin have fluctuated from 0% to 41% since its IPO.\n\nOpera has forecasted FY' 21 revenue of $242-247M , 48% growth over FY \u201820. It has forecasted FY \u201821 AEBITDA of $10-20M, despite its stated objective of investing up to $100M into scaling its fintech initiative, Dify in FY' 21 and investing for growth in Opera News, Dify and Opera Gaming.\n\nWith covid recovery, momentum in its advertising business, over 10% browser growth in EU, and ramp up of Opera News App in US and Europe, Opera has projected to grow its search and advertising revenue at 25% YoY for next several years.\n\nOpera has always taken a very conservative approach with its forecast and has not assumed any significant contributions from its Fintech(Dify) and Gaming(YoYo Games) initiatives in its FY '21 guidance. Assuming moderate success from these initiatives where Opera is investing over $100M, Opera should easily grow at upwards of 30% YoY for the next several years and reach around $500M revenue in FY \u201823 at 25%+ AEBITDA margins.\n\n**Opera's Minority Stake**\n\n* **Opay -** Opay is leading mobile money wallet in Nigeria and has expanded to Egypt in early '21. In 2019, Opay raised $170M at a valuation of $500M in external funding from Softbank, Meituan and was doing $300M in transaction processing volume(TPV) per month. Since then it has grown to over 10 million MAUs. In 2020, Opay TPV/month grew 4.5 times -- from $450M in Jan to $2B in December. Most recently in June'21, Opay raised $400M at a $2B valuation. Opera also monetized 29% of its preferred share stake for $50M and has left around 8% of stake to participate in future growth of Opay.\n* **Starmaker -** Starmaker app, which has an installed base of over 100 million users,  is a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists and is top 5 grossing music app in google play store in South East Asia, Middle East, South Asia and Europe.  When Opera invested $30M for a19.35% stake in Nov'18, it had a $17M run rate.  Since then it has been growing like a wildfire -- a CAGR of 157% in 2.5 years --  with YoY growth accelerating recently to 250% to  $180M Q1 '21 run rate and with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M Q4'20 run rate.\n* **Nanobank -** Nanobank offers Micro lending and other financial services to the underbanked and underserved population in India, Indonesia, Kenya and Mexico via its mobile apps. Last year, Opera merged its micro lending operations in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank for a 42% stake. Nanobank collectively has over 50 million users of its mobile app and has recently expanded into Mexico with credit card features for its underbanked population. Nanobank was growing revenue at a CAGR of 295% pre covid - scaling from $22M Q1 '19 revenue at 24% AEBITDA margin to $92M  Q4 '19 revenue at 41% AEBITDA margin. It has not yet completely recovered from covid in its largest market India and had $57M Q1 \u201821 revenue at 3% AEBITDA margin. Opera has stated that, with the expansion of Nanobank in Mexico and other Latin American countries, they expect Nanobank to come to pre covid quarterly revenue run rate of $120M at 30%+ AEBITDA margin next year.\n\n**Opera SUM-OF-PART valuation**\n\n1. **Conservative/Bear Case**\n\nStarmaker announced 3x growth in 2020 and $127m run rate at the end of Q4 \u201820. In Q1 \u201821, it has revenue run rate of $180M. I am using $45M as Q1 revenue and applying sequential growth of 25%, 15% and 5% to get to Q4 revenue of $68M.  Using arithmetic series sum over $45M Q1 \u201821 revenue and $68M Q4 \u201821 revenue gives 2021 revenue of $226m \\[ 4\\*(45+68)/2 \\]\n\nOpay does not report revenue run rate but TPV. Since Opay reported 4.5x TPV growth in 2020, TPV grew from $445M in January 2020 to $2B in December 2020. I am taking arithmetic series sum to get the total TPV of $14.7B for 2020 \\[12 \\* (445 + 2000)/2 \\] . Although Opera did not reveal the TPV for March 2021, they stated that the TPV is growing nicely. Along with additional product launches in additional countries, I am projecting 2x growth in TPV in 2021(a deceleration from 4.5x growth in 2020), with a TPV of $2B for Jan 2021 and $4B for Dec 2021. Taking the arithmetic series sum gives an expected 2021 TPV of $36B. I have looked at airtel Mobile Money and M-pesa revenue to TPV ratio ( 0.008 for airtel and 0.006 for M-pesa). Applying the average of 0.007 revenue to TPV ratio, gives Opay 2020 revenue of $103M and 2021 revenue of $252M. Currently Opay services are heavily discounted so their take rate is much lower than more established players like airtel and M-Pesa. Opay reported 2020 revenue of $69M and I am forecasting $21M as Q1 \u201821 revenue and applying 20% sequential growth rate through FY \u201821 gives Q4 \u201821 revenue of $37M. Using Arithmetic series sum, gives forecasted FY \u201821 revenue of $116M.\n\nBefore we do the sum of the part valuation of Opera, let's look at comparable companies :\n\n* Upstart holding(UPST), which is growing 200% YoY in FY \u201821,  is trading at 20x revenue multiple. It has a lower margin profile than Nanobank though . However, I am using only 6x multiple for Nanobank since it is projected to grow revenue at 29% compared to 100% for UPST. Nanobank is expected to achieve pre covid revenue run rate of $120M in Q1 \u201822 and as per my estimate, it should grow more than 100% YoY in FY\u201922.\n* Pinterest and Snap commanded a 50-70x revenue multiple during their 150% growth phase. I am using 8x multiple for starmaker.\n* Klarna, AfterPay, Square commanded 30-40x revenue multiple during 200+% revenue growth, I am using 8x revenue multiple for Opay\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nThe above sum of part analysis is done using a super conservative valuation just to highlight the massive disconnect in market valuation of Opera\u2019s stock price. Opera and all its minority stakes are in hyper growth mode, and if one were to apply growth multiples, it can easily more than double this conservative sum-of-part valuation.\n\n1. **Base Case**\n\nThe base case assumes the market will give Opera\u2019s high gross margin(\\~95%) and 25-30% AEBITDA business, a higher multiple with a revenue forecasted to grow at 25% for next several years and valuing Opay and Starmaker which are growing upwards of 150% YoY a 30 to 40 multiple which similar companies have commanded during their hyper growth phase.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n1. **Bull Case**\n\nAs if Opera is not undervalued enough, Opera also has 2 new growth initiatives which could offer \\*significant\\* additional upside to base case.\n\n* Opera has ambitious growth plans with a new fintech initiative, called Dify, in Europe. What I like is the tight coupling of Cashback/Coupons/Payment/CryptoWallet in the browser. Imagine 10% of 50M users of opera browser in Europe use dify, and spend an average of $500/year, Opera could get $2.5B/year of transactions/payment through them. If average cashback is 5% of transaction amount and Opera\u2019s take rate is 30%, dify\u2019s revenue will be $38M/year. Although too soon, if Opera\u2019s is successful in getting 10% of its browser users in Europe to use Dify or gain additional browser users due to popularity of Dify and launch additional product like BNPL, one could argue that Dify, in itself, can grow into $1-2B business in next couple of years. You can see how Klarna, Afterpay are valued in private/public valuations today. For comparison, think Honey, which Paypal bought in 2018 for $4B dollars, for 14 million users generating $100M of revenue and the Cashback aspect of Dify is just one part of the overall Dify value proposition.\n* Opera also recently bought YoYo Games, makers of the popular indie 2D game engine, game maker. Time will tell if they can compete against powerhouses like Unity or Roblox, but you have to give the benefit of doubt to Yahui Zhou, the 60% owner of Opera. He has a knack for identifying boring assets and turning them into growth engines. Who would have thought that the Opera Browser business, which he bought for $600M, can launch many new and exciting businesses and also grow its core with differentiated offerings. We just need to wait and see what the future brings for this.\n* Opera also bought a bank in Europe, Fjord Bank. They have not shared their plans on what they are going to do here, but if they have ambition to be neobank like N26 or revolut, Opera can quickly scale this neobank given its large user base. They can offer investment services once they reach critical mass as part of this fintech offering.\n\nAssuming Dify and Gaming takes off, I do expect significant revenue expansion of Opera Core from $250M-260M in FY \u201821(55% YoY growth), to $360-380M in FY \u201822( 45% YoY growth), and to $480-520M in 2023(26% YoY). This growth would be at 20-30% AEBITDA margin. This type of growth commands a revenue multiple of 20+.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Catalyst**\n\n* Continued momentum in Opera Ads, improved monetization of Opera News in US and Europe can provide upside to conservative FY '21 guidance of $245M by $10-$15M\n* Scale out of its fintech initiative Dify to Germany and France to its 50 million MAUs in Europe at low CAC will yield additional revenue upside. Paypal bought Honey for $4B for its 14 million users generating $100M in annual revenue in 2018. If Opera can convert 10-15% of its 50 million users to its Dify/Cashback product, It can contribute $50M+ of incremental revenue in FY '22.\n* Continued growth in its minority stakes - Nanobank, Starmaker and OPay will provide additional upside to already low valuation.\n* A funding event/IPO of Nanobank and Starmaker can further unlock value of its minority stakes.\n* Continued momentum in Opera GX along with launch of Gamebox service will bring a viral effect and can help Opera double its Opera GX MAUs from 10 million to 20 million by early next year, bringing in additional $30M of FY'22 revenue.\n* A potential partnership with Oprah, and marketing Opera as Oprah's browser could bring in visibility and brand awareness in the US and can help Opera gain additional 10+ million users of its product in the US)\n* Continued scrutiny and regulation of big tech in the US and Europe is positive for smaller players like Opera.\n* Once Opera gets institution visibility, I think it can easily trade into $50+ after getting growth multiple.\n\n**Short Report**\n\nOpera was the target of [Hindenburg short report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/) back in Jan 2020. more than 18 months have passed since then time has proven that short thesis wrong. With the benefit of time on my side, following is the rebuttal to that short report.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F\\_3HbFJ2\\_vQeKWl\\_JEzgbH7fJXZzniAtMSm80pqBows/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F_3HbFJ2_vQeKWl_JEzgbH7fJXZzniAtMSm80pqBows/edit)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOverall, I think risk-reward weigh heavily on Opera long side and offer significant upside opportunity to patient investors.\n\n*Disclosure/Disclaimer : \\*\\*\\*This is not investment advice or recommendation.

Yes, they cheated, faked financial, got delisted, filed ch 15 bankruptancy. \nHowever they are nearly back to their IPO price of 17$, from a low of 1,38$ of last year. \nFrom the JPL reports it looks company is profitable overall and I see the stock could reach a Mkcap of 50B within 10Y (now are 3.8B).\nHere what could go wrong however is they are still litigating class actions. They are chinese so hard to trust. Company could be taken private and nobody knows if they will be relisted. So its a very high risk position. \n\nPAYO is a payment system provider like stripe, paypal and many. I think is overlooked as it only ipoed few months ago. Market cap of 2B \n\nZIM here the train is already gone with a 400% YTD performance. However they have a strong balance sheet and based in Israele is a big plus as to shipping containers is a very great location.

Today, I felt like giving back by shining some light on 2 companies that have seemingly been forgotten by our community (retards typically have poor working memory, so you are forgiven). I can't write for shit, so here are some facts in bullet points detailing each play (fundamentals and catalysts/reason to bag hold).\n\n# Proterra\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 4.88\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 23.10\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 34.1%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 15.50 (46,78% upside, backed by BofA and Citigroup)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Infrastructure bill baby. $39 billion USD for public transit, with around $7.5 going directly towards replacing buses. Biggest competitor of PTRA on the EV bus market is a chinese company. Thankfully, a NDAA that was passed in a bipartisan fashion a year ago provides a restriction on funding to be used from a federal transit agency to a Chinese owned or operated company.\n* What specific aspects of the infrastructure bill might advantage PTRA (according to John Allen in the 08-11-2021 press release) :\n   * $800 million a year for 5 years guaranteed\n   * $2.5 billion, up to $5 billion for electric school buses\n   * $2.25 billion to electrify the ports\n   * $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Only american EV bus company that also sells charging infrastructure, batteries, and powertrain\n   * Partnership with Thomas (school buses), LG (battery components), Vanhool (coaches), Frieghtliner (delivery trucks), Optimal EV (airport and hospital transit), Komatsu (construction equipment), Lightning motors (sprinter vans)\n* 2 decades of experience in a very young market with plenty of space to grow\n   * Bus with the biggest battery capacity and milage (300-ish miles compared to european buses with 100-200 miles)\n* Politically indifferent\n   * Conservative = protectionism = good for American PTRA\n   * Liberals = weird taxes on carbon emitting businesses = good for PTRA\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price and price targets when the infrastructure deal passes.\n* Hold that shit till 2035\n\n# Paya Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 5.05\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 18.22\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 61.7%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 14.50 (44.71% upside, backed by Morgan Stanley, Truist, BTIG)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Voting to cut warrant-sponsored dilution from 17.7 mil shares to 4.6 mil shares happening on september 10.\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Very good multiples for a double digit growth company compared to peers (Paypal, Square, etc.).\n* Profitable as fuck @ 25.7% EBITDA margins\n* Institutions buying up like crazy with zero institution holding a net short position.\n* IV low as hell.\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price on September 10.\n* Hold or sell that shit after it pops to 15$. You do you.\n\nProof of positions : [https://imgur.com/gallery/Ch54jd6](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ch54jd6)\n\n**8000 shares of PAYA @ 10.42 + 100 Sep17'21 10C @ 1.05**\n\n**6000 shares of PTRA @ 11.08**",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed 4 and a half months and counting but \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CB Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/aqjaxo37nvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478a56b2d64a8f5278121224d85d13646b93ade2)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!",

        "selftext": "Matterport will create a digital clone of our world for the metaverse.\n\nBefore I explain how, check out my previous DD posts for some context.  \n[MTTR Bringing 3D Photogrammetry Experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/)  \n[MTTR Explosive Potential](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3469k/mttr_update_explosive_avenues_of_potential/)\n\nNow, you\u2019re probably wondering \u201cWhat is the metaverse u/cru3211?\u201d\n\nLet me tell you.\n\n# The Metaverse\n\nThe **metaverse** is a paradigm shift in the way we organize ourselves as a society. It\u2019s an evolutionary embodiment of technology &amp; the internet. It\u2019s commonly envisioned as a \u201csecond layer\u201d to our world. Sort of like\u2026 a virtual clone of it\u2026 that\u2019s digitized. See where this is going?\n\nThis is the **spatial web**. It represents an emerging three-dimensional web experience. It\u2019ll blow the old internet out of the water.\n\nresearch: metaverse, web 3.0, and spatial web for more insights.\n\nMSG me and I\u2019ll ramble more about the metaverse. For now, just understand that it\u2019s an inevitable innovation that will see widespread growth within the next decade. Matterport is likely (but not guaranteed) to be a part of this evolution.\n\n# Government Contract\n\nMatterport has entered the public sector to digitize the valuable assets of the US government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cThrough the use of Matterport\u2019s technology, federal agencies will be  \nable to *digitize and index* government facilities, infrastructure and  \nother assets such ***as airplanes, ships and submarines.\u201d***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cFor example, in the event of an emergency, digital twins of  \n**buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, water supplies or electrical grids** can be instantly viewed and analyzed by authorized users to  \nrespond more efficiently\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cAccess to 3D digital twins and the spatial data behind them can fuel  \na multitude of use cases such as **emergency response, military**  \n**training and historical preservation**.\u201d - George Hoyem at In-Q-Tel\n\nHow could you not be bullish? They\u2019re creating a private searchable 3D database. This is immensely powerful. Imagine being able to visualize the entire underground infrastructure of NYC without having to dig everything up? \n\n# Collaboration Tool\n\nYou know how on Google docs you can live collaborate with other users on a doc? I use it all the time. Matterport just added that for digital twins. That leads me to my next point.\n\n# Prediction:\n\nI\u2019ve come to believe that Google will want Matterport. I have no evidence of this, it\u2019s just a feeling. This is because the two companies align in a variety of ways. (I guess Google could just develop their own tech, but I just feel like they might take the easy route and acquire.)\n\n* Google Earth has exteriors of 3D buildings, but not interiors. Imagine how Matterport\u2019s 3D dataset could be utilized for that tool?\n* Matterport and Google are both platform companies with a focus on big data and indexing that data.\n* Google Real-estate searching was removed about a decade ago, but what if this was the catalyst for them to bring it back. I predict that Google will bring back real estate searching but integrate it with 3D interactive experiences.\n* Google\u2019s AI research could be fueled by Matterport\u2019s datasets.\n* Matterport could be integrated with Google\u2019s suite of apps.\n\n**My positions:**  \n100 shares at $14. Some calls expiring from Sept \u2013 December ranging from $17.5 - $25.",

        "selftext": "I have been researching and investing in CASI Pharmaceuticals since June 2021. I wanted to share with you my DD and encourage you to view my 'Master File' on Google Sheets that I have linked below. \n\n$CASI is a US-based Oncology/Hematology pharmaceutical company founded in 1990 (formerly Entremed). The company has shifted in recent years to place their focus on developing and commercializing their drugs in China. This is primarily due to China's rising cancer population, facilitated approval process, less competition, and to ride the wave as more $ is flowing into R&amp;D and STEM in China than another country as China transitions from a manufacturing/industrial powerhouse. \n\nUnlike the majority of clinical-stage biotech/pharma companies, CASI already has a commercially available drug (EVOMELA) on the market, bringing in over $15 in 2020, with over 80% in sales this year alone. The CEO, Wei-Wu He, has said the drug is nearly bringing in enough revenue to cover all of CASI sales and marketing expenses. However, CASI primary and game changing drugs are CNCT-19 (phase 2 registration trial), BI-1206 (phase 1/2 &amp; 1/2a), CID-103 (phase 1), CB-5339 (phase 1) and various other assets already approved that they are submitting NMPA registrations studies for i.e. Thiotepa and Octreotide. \n\nCASI is focused on building its business through partnerships, co-commercialization agreements, and equity stakes in other therapeutic and pharmaceutical companies. For example, CNCT-19 is being developed by Juventas, BI-1206 by BioInvent, CB-5339 by Cleave Therapeutics, etc. These deals have allowed CASI to secure promising lead drug candidates, that, if approved, CASI has exclusive licensing and commercialization for the Greater China market.\n\nIn this post I would like to focus on their t-cell therapy CNCT-19 as it is the nearest to trial completion, shows very promising results, is an innovative cancer treatment for ALL and NHL, and has competitors that I can use for potential revenue modeling. If approved, CNCT-19 will be the only domestically manufactured t-cell therapy in China. Because of this CASI expects their drug to be much more affordable compared to current treats that average $300,000. BTIG release a report in May 2021, explaining that if CASI can offer their drug for under $80,000 their price target would increase from $4 to $21.  Their current CAR-T competitors include Novartis' Kymriah ($298m in revenue first half of 2021) and Gilead's Yescarta ($338 million in the first half of 2021). CASI's market cap currently sits at around $232 million, with no debt, enough cash ($73m in C&amp;CE Q2 2021) runway to fund operations through 2023, with a current burn rate of only $6m (Oppenheimer). \n\nI would encourage you to do more research on CASI and check out the master file that I have created which contains more information about their assets with all clincial trial data, financials, insider ownership, rating reports, competitors, and information on the 100,000 sq meter manufacturing facility they are building (CASI WUXI). Thank you for your time!",
