        "selftext": "Market cap around $5B-50B currently, could be worth $1T by 2030.  My vote would have gone to $SQ but no longer under $50B. $PLTR will be interesting to watch next week. \n\nEVs/clean tech doesn\u2019t count as current multiples are already anticipating sky-high growth. \n\nMade mistake of posting similar thread to wsb. Some enthusiasm for $NVTA, \u201c$SPY\u201d (maybe meant $CRWD), and $BIGC. \n\nSkeptical of $BIGC as $SPOT much more heavily entrenched AND growing faster. \n\n$NVTA is interesting and don\u2019t write it off. But some problems I see (1) ask any clinician and you\u2019ll learn genomic medicine hasn\u2019t lived up to hype, yes we know SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), linkage etc but everything \u201cpolyfactoral,\u201d even \u201cepigenetic\u201d and known risk factors (diet, exercise, family history, SES, etc) tend to be much more helpful; (2) insofar as genomics can be monetized would see a as to yet unknown startup with flashier marketing and better tech interface taking spoils; (3) don\u2019t really see enough brand loyalty (compared with cult like followings of $AAPL $TSLA even $LULU) to any genomics company but particularly not to $NVTA which has marketed itself mostly to clinicians\u2014will be important in a crowded space with several viable competitors. \n\nSo only one real candidate worth discussing so far. Any other ideas?",
