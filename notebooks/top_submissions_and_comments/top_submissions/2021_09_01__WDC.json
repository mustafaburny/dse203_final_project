        "selftext": "Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. \n\nMy question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: \n\n$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. \n\n$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. \n\nSemiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. \n\nWhat are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",

        "selftext": " \n\nThis is why I believe Seagate's earning will suffer on going forward basis and it is because of collapse of \"investment product that shall not be named\" price.\n\nIn May 2021, \"investment product that shall not be named\" was launched with little fanfare, but not in tech community where it led to shortage of both SSD and HDD in the market, resulting in both increase of demand and increase of pricing.\n\nWell... After few months of excitements, there has been gradual deflation of price of \"investment product that shall not be named\" where now price is range bound around $200 and netspace of \"investment product that shall not be named\" is stabilizing. This implies artificial spike in demand of both SSD and HDD have disappeared, which will eventually impact Seagate's earnings.\n\nIf I was part of Seagate management, I would start purchasing \"investment product that shall not be named\" to inflate the price to keep this gravy train longer, but I digress.\n\nI have excluded Western Digital from this posting because their ongoing merger with Kioxia.",
