        "selftext": "TLDR:  I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a  selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.\n\n# Observations/Assumptions\n\nBefore  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.\n\n* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.\n* For most people it is impossible to time the market\n* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.\n* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.\n* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)\n* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)\n* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).\n* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)\n* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.\n* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.\n* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:\n   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.\n   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don\u2019t want to support.\n   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nUsing  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.\n\n# Experiment 2020\n\n750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies\u2019 average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:\n\n* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1\n* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2\n* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3\n\nFor  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.\n\nThis was done for all of the metrics below:\n\n* ROE\n* Revenue Growth %\n* EBITDA %\n* FCF %\n\nThe  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.\n\nAny stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.\n\n[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)\n\nROE Example\n\nThat left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.\n\nThis  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?\n\nThat left 26 across 7 sectors.\n\n[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)\n\n**2020 Industry Breakdown**\n\nThese  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.\n\n2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\nCan we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.\n\n# Experiment 2021\n\n2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:\n\n* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company\n* Profit Margin \u2013 shows how effective the business is at making money\n* Operating Margin \u2013 shows how much money the company earns on its revenue\n* FCF Margin \u2013 shows how efficient a company is with their cash\n* EBITDA Margin \u2013 shows a companies\u2019 operating profitability\n* ROE \u2013 shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money\n* ROA \u2013 shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits\n* ROIC \u2013 shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns\n* Debt/Equity Ratio \u2013 shows the financial stability of a company\n\nMore  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:\n\n\u00b7  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.\n\nEach  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%,  Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.\n\nI  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn\u2019t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.\n\nHere is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:\n\n[Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)\n\nHere is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company\u2019s most recent year):\n\n[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)\n\nHere is an example of the visualizations for the data:\n\n[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)\n\nI  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.\n\nNext,  I read the description of \\~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn\u2019t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it\u2019s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \\~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I\u2019d  need to build a separate model.\n\nI  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \\~75.\n\nWe were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:\n\n[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)\n\nI then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.\n\n2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Industry Classification\n\n* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.\n   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.\n   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren\u2019t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.\n* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.\n   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.\n   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).\n   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.\n\n# 2020 Stocks\n\nABMD\n\nADBE\n\nANET\n\nBWXT\n\nCRL\n\nDG\n\nENR\n\nETSY\n\nEXEL\n\nICLR\n\nISRG\n\nKLAC\n\nLKQ\n\nLRCX\n\nMNST\n\nMPWR\n\nMTCH\n\nOLED\n\nPAYC\n\nPHM\n\nTER\n\nTTD\n\nUI\n\nVEEV\n\nVMW\n\nVRTX\n\n# 2021 Stocks\n\nAAON\n\nAAPL\n\nACN\n\nADBE\n\nAEIS\n\nALGN\n\nAMAT\n\nANET\n\nAPH\n\nATR\n\nATVI\n\nAX\n\nBLD\n\nCDNS\n\nCGNX\n\nCHD\n\nCHE\n\nCORT\n\nCPRT\n\nDLB\n\nDORM\n\nEPAM\n\nESNT\n\nETSY\n\nEW\n\nEXPD\n\nEXPO\n\nFAST\n\nFB\n\nFIX\n\nFOXF\n\nFTNT\n\nGGG\n\nGOOG\n\nGRMN\n\nHEI.A\n\nHELE\n\nIDA\n\nINS\n\nINTC\n\nINTU\n\nIRBT\n\nISRG\n\nCCSI\n\nZD\n\nKLAC\n\nLRCX\n\nLULU\n\nMASI\n\nMED\n\nMKSI\n\nMKTX\n\nMNST\n\nMORN\n\nMPWR\n\nMSFT\n\nNMIH\n\nNRC\n\nNVDA\n\nODFL\n\nOLED\n\nOLLI\n\nPAYC\n\nPAYX\n\nPRLB\n\nQLYS\n\nREGN\n\nRMR\n\nROAD\n\nSCCO\n\nSFBS\n\nSLP\n\nSTMP\n\nTDY\n\nTER\n\nTREX\n\nTROW\n\nTTD\n\nTYL\n\nUI\n\nV\n\nVEEV\n\nVRTX\n\nWAL\n\nYETI\n\n# Notes\n\nI  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments.

        "selftext": "TLDR: I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below. My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.\n\n# Observations/Assumptions\n\nBefore you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions, not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can jump down my throat.\n\n* Companies with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies missing one or more of those attributes.\n* For most people it is impossible to time the market\n* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.\n* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.\n* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)\n* [Index fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)\n* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).\n* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)\n* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.\n* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.\n* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:\n   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp) even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in that same set of stocks in the same proportions.\n   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don\u2019t want to support.\n   * Due to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020, forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price, which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nUsing industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.\n\n# Experiment 2020\n\n750 largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index. For example, each companies\u2019 average ROE of the last 4 years was compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:\n\n* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1\n* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2\n* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3\n\nFor example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was 10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%, they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a great rating.\n\nThis was done for all of the metrics below:\n\n* ROE\n* Revenue Growth %\n* EBITDA %\n* FCF %\n\nThe relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be decreased to 125% for a better distribution.\n\nAny stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.\n\nExample below on ROE:\n\n[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/unapdml3m6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d615130616fb32c179674306cb461d3c0dcb2d)\n\nThat left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.\n\nThis left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude them?\n\nThat left 26 across 7 sectors. \n\n**2020 Industries**\n\n[2020 Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/o9llcazgm6081.png?width=386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64e5c541e836a173e373113b5d13cc5b7648f57a)\n\nThese 26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.\n\n2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\nCan we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.\n\n# Experiment 2021\n\n2,850 tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list. The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:\n\n* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company\n* Profit Margin \u2013 shows how effective the business is at making money\n* Operating Margin \u2013 shows how much money the company earns on its revenue\n* FCF Margin \u2013 shows how efficient a company is with their cash\n* EBITDA Margin \u2013 shows a companies\u2019 operating profitability\n* ROE \u2013 shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money\n* ROA \u2013 shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits\n* ROIC \u2013 shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns\n* Debt/Equity Ratio \u2013 shows the financial stability of a company\n\nMore metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:\n\n\u00b7 3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.\n\nEach stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%, Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the particular metric to find a useful distribution.\n\nI also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a score of 23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119. Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn\u2019t match the original input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet again.\n\nHere is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:\n\n[Aerospace and Defense Example Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/s80995tpo6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fbc4aa6a06985cbedd1d4bf26d678b94bcc977)\n\nHere is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company\u2019s most recent year):\n\n[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/12pnpz90p6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d32a3469e261be37cba38f28c9ca39ef0552e0)\n\nHere is an example of the visualizations for the data:\n\n[Data Visualizations](https://preview.redd.it/112baw12p6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c55275971eba7f3f0d316f84a275da53572fcf8)\n\nI applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.\n\nNext, I read the description of \\~300 stocks and looked through their financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn\u2019t interested in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it\u2019s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated \\~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I\u2019d need to build a separate model.\n\nI then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \\~75.\n\nWe were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83 companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:\n\n**Industry**\n\n[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/r9rt903pp6081.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95168c9e7c65cf548f4bd7c4be45ffaf9b1ac46b)\n\nI then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.\n\n2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Industry Classification\n\n* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.\n   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.\n   * This seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other that aren\u2019t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.\n* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.\n   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.\n   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).\n   * I ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10 stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such as biotech and pharmaceutical.\n\n# 2020 Stocks\n\nABMD\n\nADBE\n\nANET\n\nBWXT\n\nCRL\n\nDG\n\nENR\n\nETSY\n\nEXEL\n\nICLR\n\nISRG\n\nKLAC\n\nLKQ\n\nLRCX\n\nMNST\n\nMPWR\n\nMTCH\n\nOLED\n\nPAYC\n\nPHM\n\nTER\n\nTTD\n\nUI\n\nVEEV\n\nVMW\n\nVRTX\n\n# 2021 Stocks\n\nAAON\n\nAAPL\n\nACN\n\nADBE\n\nAEIS\n\nALGN\n\nAMAT\n\nANET\n\nAPH\n\nATR\n\nATVI\n\nAX\n\nBLD\n\nCDNS\n\nCGNX\n\nCHD\n\nCHE\n\nCORT\n\nCPRT\n\nDLB\n\nDORM\n\nEPAM\n\nESNT\n\nETSY\n\nEW\n\nEXPD\n\nEXPO\n\nFAST\n\nFB\n\nFIX\n\nFOXF\n\nFTNT\n\nGGG\n\nGOOG\n\nGRMN\n\nHEI.A\n\nHELE\n\nIDA\n\nINS\n\nINTC\n\nINTU\n\nIRBT\n\nISRG\n\nCCSI\n\nZD\n\nKLAC\n\nLRCX\n\nLULU\n\nMASI\n\nMED\n\nMKSI\n\nMKTX\n\nMNST\n\nMORN\n\nMPWR\n\nMSFT\n\nNMIH\n\nNRC\n\nNVDA\n\nODFL\n\nOLED\n\nOLLI\n\nPAYC\n\nPAYX\n\nPRLB\n\nQLYS\n\nREGN\n\nRMR\n\nROAD\n\nSCCO\n\nSFBS\n\nSLP\n\nSTMP\n\nTDY\n\nTER\n\nTREX\n\nTROW\n\nTTD\n\nTYL\n\nUI\n\nV\n\nVEEV\n\nVRTX\n\nWAL\n\nYETI\n\n# Notes\n\nI partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 19, 2021**\n\nThe stock market traded mixed today, with the both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) slipping whiled the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed on the day, driven higher by a strong performance in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.\n\nNotable Numbers Today\n\n* SPY: -0.19%\n* QQQ: +0.56%\n* DIA: -0.76%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%\n* Apple (AAPL): +1.70%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%\n* Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%\n* PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%\n\nMarkets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. \n\nJim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said \u201calthough all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said \u201cJust like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.\n\nAdding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. \n\nYesterday, the Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The FDA approved boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE, BNTX) and Moderna (MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines for all adults in the US.\n* Apple regained the mantle of most valuable company from Microsoft, with the company reaching a fresh all-time high today\n* After a pop in the beginning of November, weed stocks continued their steep declines as nationwide legalization efforts in the US continue to falter. The largest fund tracking the pot industry, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) tumbled to its lowest price since last year and is down 60% from its high in February.\n* As talked about yesterday, Apple (AAPL) is reportedly accelerating development on its fully autonomous Apple Car, set to debut in 2025. A Morgan Stanley analyst said the car would double revenues and market value.\n* The Pentagon announced it has issued formal solicitations to Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Oracle (ORCL) for a multibillion-dollar cloud-computing contract to replace the JEDI procurement, which became mired in litigation between Microsoft and Amazon and objections from Congress.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with a host of target raises following its earnings report. Average price target $175 at Buy. Stock currently around $150\n* ConocoPhillips (COP) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $90 to $95 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, November 17th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowe\u2019s and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowe\u2019s.\n*****\n&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.\n*****\n&gt; Home improvement giant Lowe\u2019s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.\n*****\n&gt; Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company\u2019s stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.\n*****\n&gt; Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.\n*****\n&gt; On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.\n*****\n&gt; The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.\n*****\n&gt; Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUS stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.\n*****\n&gt; Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath &amp; Body Works and Victoria\u2019s Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/jnD7DiY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/199Ptn8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3UfhdZX.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Ks8X4jM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/sphxmmg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($BABA $NVDA $WMT $TSN $TGT $HD $LCID $SE $RAIL $M $AMAT $LOW $BIDU $JD $OEG $GMBL $ZIM $OTLY $CSCO $HHR $POWW $RMBL $TJX $KSS $FL $STNE $BFLY $WMG $IDEX $JMIA $KLIC $SONO $ACM $IQ $BILI $VBLT $PTN $KALA $NTES $CSIQ $CMAX $AAP)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($TGT $BIDU $LOW $ZIM $TJX $BILI $IQ $MANU $DESP $NNOX $DSX $NTIC $MTOR $BV $SCVL $WLMS $BWAY $IMBI $EVGN $MCG $VTEX $HTOO $SRAD)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oNQL407.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Peda6db.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kPv68Vv.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7dXDEoE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IvQACNC.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/91BampG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ssUxyux.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tpVw8Yv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2sJ2bOx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* LCID\n* RIVN\n* GOEV\n* CRO.X\n* FSR\n* ROKU\n* TTCF\n* SPI\n* ZIM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-lowes-target-glaxosmithkline-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lowe\u2019s (LOW)** \u2013 Lowe\u2019s rose 2.5% in the premarket after beating estimates on the top and bottom lines and raising its annual revenue forecast.

        "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 15th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures up 100 points after market breaks a 5-week winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were slightly higher in early morning trading on Monday as investors prepared to start the week after the S&amp;P 500 broke a five-week winning streak.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures gained 137 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each up about 0.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla shares fell 2% premarket Monday following a weekend Twitter exchange between founder Elon Musk and Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period,\u201d the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats wrote.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI keep forgetting that you\u2019re still alive,\u201d Musk responded. In a follow-up tweet, he said, \u201cWant me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word \u2026\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Dow component ExxonMobil saw its shares under pressure, falling nearly 1% premarket as West Texas Intermediate oil futures slipped more than 1% to fall just under $80 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Also on the bluechip index, Boeing rose nearly 3% following news that Saudi Arabian Airlines is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a wide-body jet order. At the same time, Emirates announced an order for two Boeing 777 Freighters at the 2021 Dubai Airshow.\n*****\n&gt; Dollar Tree shares gained 7% premarket following a report Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has taken a stake worth at least $1.8 billion in the discount store chain and will push it to do more to add to shareholder value.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are coming off a losing week after last month\u2019s consumer price index made its largest annual increase in more than three decades. The major averages snapped a five-week winning streak.\n*****\n&gt; Markets digested a range of economic news last week showing that inflation was rising even more than expected and workers continued to quit their jobs in search of better opportunities.\n*****\n&gt; That data \u201cadded to concerns that inflation at a 30-year high could indeed remain a stickier problem and challenge for businesses, consumers and monetary policy makers to contend with over the next four to six months or even longer\u201d John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said in a note Monday. He said he expects inflation to dampen, however.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPositive offsets to the current waves of inflation hitting the U.S. economy at this time are likely to emerge as the effects of what may have been overstimulation of the economy at the height of the pandemic fade,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Investors this week will get a look at how much consumers are spending when retail sales data drops Tuesday, while housing numbers come Wednesday with new construction starts and building permits. This also will be a busy week for the Federal Reserve, with multiple officials scheduled to speak through the week.\n*****\n&gt; Also, the Labor Department reported that a record 4.4 million workers left their jobs in September, generally that they can get something better. Consumer confidence, though, dipped to a 10-year low in November, as consumers apparently flush with cash are growing more worried about inflation.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s CPI jumped 6.2% from a year ago, well above the 5.9% estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones. The index, which tracks a basket of consumer products, increased 0.9% on a month-over-month basis, also hotter than expected.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.6% and the S&amp;P 500 eased 0.3% last week. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was the main underperformer, dropping 0.7% as rising bond yields dented growth pockets of the market.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; Also denting sentiment was a report that workers left their jobs in record numbers in September, with 4.43 million people quitting, the Labor Department reported Friday. The exodus occurred as the U.S. had 10.44 million employment openings that month, according to the report.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are not far from their record highs.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmulEWE-T6Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TSN $OEG $OTLY $AAP $IDEX $CSPR $WMT $HD $SE $STNE $LZB $DLO $TGT $BIDU $LOW $TJX $BILI $NNOX $NVDA $CSCO $VSCO $BABA $JD $M $BJ $WOOF $AMAT $WDAY $INTU $PANW $WSM $FL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MrpShLB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 16th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are flat as investors evaluate big retail earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained after better-than-expected results from Walmart and Home Depot.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow, which contains the two big retailers, added 70 points, or 0.19%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly in the red.\n*****\n&gt; Walmart kicked off a busy week of retail earnings by saying third-quarter profit and revenue was well above estimates with U.S. same-store sales jumping 9.2%, excluding fuel. The company also raised its forecast for 2021, saying adjusted earnings per share will be around $6.40 versus its prior expectations of between $6.20 and $6.35. The shares moved slighly lower in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Home Depot gained more than 1%, however, after its third-quarter earnings beat estimates on a 9.8% sales burst.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales figures for October came in 1.7% higher than 0.7% in September, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected sales to have jumped by 1.5%.\n*****\n&gt; Industrial production numbers will also be released Tuesday, as well as the NAHB housing market index survey.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Monday, the Dow dipped about 13 points, or 0.04%, for its fourth negative session in the last five. At the high of the day the 30-stock index gained about 136 points. The S&amp;P 500 finished the day unchanged at 4,682.87. The benchmark index moved between gains and losses during the session, at one point gaining 0.3%, while also trading 0.21% lower. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.04%. The Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer, declining 0.45%.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks\u2019 move came as interest rates rose, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note topping 1.62% while the 30-bear Treasury bond rose above 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation fears are weighing on the market after last month\u2019s consumer price index posted its largest annual increase in more than three decades. Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he believes inflation will moderate in 2022, but that \u201cthe path to lower inflation [will] begin with higher inflation in the front half of the year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe stickier drivers of inflation are likely to persist, but our base case is that they will not outweigh the improvement we expect in the transitory elements,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday afternoon President Joe Biden signed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. The package includes funding for transportation, broadband and utilities.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages are coming off their first negative week in six, but stocks are still trading around all-time high levels. As Wall Street strategists look to 2022 some, including Morgan Stanley\u2019s Michael Wilson, believe the picture looks muted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith financial conditions tightening and earnings growth slowing, the 12-month risk/reward for the broad indices looks unattractive at current prices,\u201d he said Monday in a note to clients. \u201cHowever, strong nominal GDP growth should continue to provide plenty of good investment opportunities at the stock level for active managers,\u201d he added. His 12-month base target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,400, which is 6% below where the index closed on Monday.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/e1OFise.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7RKeZdA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/s5Dygpo.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PEb1Dek.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/w4BQNv2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($BABA $NVDA $WMT $TSN $TGT $HD $LCID $SE $RAIL $M $AMAT $LOW $BIDU $JD $OEG $GMBL $ZIM $OTLY $CSCO $HHR $POWW $RMBL $TJX $KSS $FL $STNE $BFLY $WMG $IDEX $JMIA $KLIC $SONO $ACM $IQ $BILI $VBLT $PTN $KALA $NTES $CSIQ $CMAX $AAP)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($WMT $HD $SE $JMIA $NTES $DAVA $ARMK $DG $FUV $AQUA $DOYU $HIVE $OCSL $GDS $ITRN $RSKD $DAO $ESEA $BNR $ECC $CWCO $GFF $MDWD $AUVI $VOD $AIH $REAX $ONON $OMQS $IPHA $LILM)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7zroWVL.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gnlJVdh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qIEmQpP.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Iy86h4x.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Fqns3OU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VGnIgIv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ZYhMgYe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/iuwJ5rI.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MtgFBmW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/pHS6FXe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uNtzOap.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* MARA\n* GGPI\n* VGX.X\n* NIO\n* TSLA\n* AMC\n* CRWD\n* POWW\n* BLNK\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-rackspace-technology-axon-enterprise-royalty-pharma-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Rackspace Technology (RXT)** \u2013 Rackspace beat estimates by a penny a share, with quarterly earnings of 25 cents per share.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 18th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stocks rise led by tech shares as Nvidia soars](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stocks rose after Nvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker, reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and gave a positive outlook.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 24 points, or 0.07%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading has been choppy this week with the major averages mostly wavering around the flat line, but the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are still on track for a positive week and are sitting less than 1% from their records. The Dow is 1.7% from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Nvidia shares popped more than 8% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results and issued a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter ending in January. The chipmaker reporter a 55% gain in data center sales from the same period a year ago and its biggest market, gaming, reported a 42% sales increase.\n*****\n&gt; Those gains helped lift other chip stocks in early morning trading. Advanced Micro Devices gained 2% while Skyworks and Micron Technology added more than 1%.\n*****\n&gt; Retail continued its big earnings week. Shares of Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s kicked the day off jumping 11% and 7%, respectively. Both companies smashed quarterly profit and revenue estimates, much like its peers who reported earlier in the week. Most have reported same-store sales gains from the previous year and investors are optimistic going into the holiday shopping season.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere, Deere saw its shares rise more than 1% after it came to a resolution with workers who had been on strike since Oct. 14.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing also saw its shares rise another almost 2% following on upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the aerospace giant has significant upside as it clears up several issues that have dogged the company.\n*****\n&gt; Going in the other direction, Cisco Systems fell 5% due to weaker revenue guidance and a revenue miss. Kraft Heinz shares also dropped more than 2% after the company announced a secondary offering of common stock.\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 211 points, dragged down by a 4.7% loss in Visa shares. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.26%. The Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.33% lower, despite most mega-cap technology companies closing in the green.\n*****\n&gt; The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer on Wednesday, dropping 1.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRecent economic reports remain strong, but today\u2019s stock market action highlights that it is already discounting another Covid cycle,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cConcerns about Covid also caused the 10-year bond yield to decline for the first time in 6 days and kept downward pressure on commodity prices including another sizable drop in crude oil prices. If inflation keeps rising while another Covid surge again stalls real economic activity, we may find out how the stock market handles a pseudo-stagflationary episode,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; Investors await more retail earnings on Thursday with Applied Materials and Palo Alto Networks reporting after the bell.\n*****\n&gt; The Labor Department will report last week\u2019s jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting initial filings for unemployment insurance fell to 260,000 for the week ending November 13, from the previous week\u2019s 267,000 claims.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/ZIQbVzs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nbs6n3M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/YPFLg0Q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/sphxmmg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Q2yy2jJ.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2l2m1qw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ihtHHa3.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gv1vdEt.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MBxyvVe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/JofUtHR.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/eKYKA2k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/Q5l4QGo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-alibaba-jdcom-cisco-nvidia-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Macy\u2019s (M)** \u2013 Macy\u2019s surged 8% in the premarket after the retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit, and raised its full-year outlook.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmulEWE-T6Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TSN $OEG $OTLY $AAP $IDEX $CSPR $WMT $HD $SE $STNE $LZB $DLO $TGT $BIDU $LOW $TJX $BILI $NNOX $NVDA $CSCO $VSCO $BABA $JD $M $BJ $WOOF $AMAT $WDAY $INTU $PANW $WSM $FL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MrpShLB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

        "selftext": "One of the things I love watching for is trades within sectors that I know somewhat, where one or two businesses report earnings, followed (over a period of one or more trading days) by other businesses in the same sector. On earnings, stocks in the same sector tend to all fall or rise together (e.g., UBER, LYFT) absent some sort of significant differentiating factor that comes in during the earnings report or in the guidance, unless there are clear signs that market share is definitely being taken away from one player to the benefit of another (e.g., AMD, INTC). \n\nTake Lyft and Uber. Lyft reports before Uber, generally, so a positive report and guidance for Lyft (which is much smaller, lacking a global footprint and certain businesses Uber has) generally results in Uber shares rising the day after Lyft reports (assuming, of course, that Lyft rises as a result of the positive report and guidance). The same generally occurs when Lyft stock drops on account of a negative report and/or guidance- Uber drops, unless people are counting heavily on different business lines shoring up Uber's balance sheet and earnings for some reason. Occasionally you might get some decoupling because, for example, a pandemic forces large international markets into lockdown while the U.S. remains open, but, for the most part, the pattern holds. (Just don't expect to hold Uber up to and past its earnings date based solely on how LYFT did!)  \n\n\nBy contrast, an earnings report and guidance that lifts AMD does not always lift Intel. AMD and Intel's offerings come about as close to direct substitutes as one can get; in the PC and server markets, we basically have a duopoly.\n\nSo let's take those out of the picture, shall we?\n\nApplied Materials reports next week. I am long AMAT (LEAPS long) because I believe there's a secular trend of increasing CapEx for semiconductor manufacturing equipment (built by the likes of AMAT) that is supported by the massive supply chain shortage plus the movement of manufacturing facilities out of countries like China, plus the metaverse, obviously. (The last factor is more psychological than anything at the moment, but it's clearly material to investors who pumped up every semiconductor manufacturer in the universe last week.) What I am not inclined to do is to gamble on AMAT earnings at this point, as the date is too close, and 90 percent of the run-up has already occurred, which leaves me to (more likely than not) be IV crushed. Plus, there are some significant negative catalysts standing between today and the earnings date. But there is a higher margin business in the same sector as AMAT that reports much later.\n\nSynopsys owns a lot of IP in the semiconductor space, and does silicon design and verification work, silicon manufacturing design, and software security assessment/validation work. In short, SNPS does all the things one would need in an environment where AMAT and all of the other semiconductor manufacturers prosper. Good guidance and earnings reports in the coming days from the likes of AMAT and NVDA should prove a boost to SNPS stock in the days following earnings reports for AMAT and NVDA; bad news should have the opposite effect. For the reasons I state above, once I complete my own DD I am likely to run with SNPS longs that I hold through earnings (SNPS reports in December). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same goes for the cybersecurity space, where Palo Alto Networks reports the week of 11/18, followed in a couple of weeks' time by Crowdstrike and ZScaler, which are all pure-play cybersecurity stocks. \n\nThe point is to own/short the later-reporting stock (or options in the underlying) next week so that you benefit from the sympathetic rise/fall that occurs when the earlier-reporting company reports its earnings and guidance next week. Don't bother acquiring them this week because retail starts reporting next week and that's liable to tank everything as the numbers and guidance will be depressing from all but the most well-prepared retailers. \n\nAdditionally, you probably don't want to own a whole lot of anything (longs) past November 9, either. Why? Inflation numbers for October get reported on 11/10 before open, and if they are anything but low AF, stocks likely will see a shock as a result. At a minimum, give it a few days before jumping back in.\n\nP.S. If the AMAT/SNPS interplay appeals to you, NVDA's earnings report and guidance are worth watching for a similar sympathetic change. NVDA reports 11/17, the day before AMAT on 11/18. Any indication that NVDA is ramping up production, getting additional contracts for metashit, or is less dependent on cryptominers than it is on gamers will all benefit NVDA and (to a lesser extent) will pump up AMAT. But again, I think the odds of the market tanking (not a correction, but enough to cost you serious money if you are highly leveraged) after the 11/10/2021 October inflation report and/or depressing reports/guidance from retail are high enough that you should wait until closer to NVDA's earnings date to try this out.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone. Have a nice Friday, and take it easy this weekend.\n\n*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.\n\n**Main Watchlist:**\n\nGapping UP:\n\n* MRNA\n* INTU\n* ZM\n* PTON\n* PLUG\n* MU\n* JD\n* BKE\n\nGapping DOWN:\n\n* AMAT\n* WSM\n* FL\n* UAL\n* RCL\n* FTCH\n\n**Momentum Watchlist:**\n\n* LGVN\u00a0(+97%)\n* GTEC (+53%)\n* UWMC (+20%)\n* TUSK (+21%)\n* GOEV (+3%)\n* DPW (+14%)\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nStocks\u00a0are\u00a0looking to open a bit lower this morning, after we saw a mixed day in the market yesterday. COVID lockdowns in Europe are spooking investors, and the reopening plays are getting hit as a result. The US has lower vaccination rates than many of the European countries, so it's a situation that is definitely worth following. Despite this, supply chain issues, and ongoing inflation concerns, the Nasdaq closed at a record high. Stay-at-home plays could be hot today, I'll be keeping an eye on ZM and PTON. We could be getting an announcement regarding President Biden's Federal Reserve chair nomination sometime today or this weekend, and while I don't think it will have an immediate effect on the market, it's worth staying in the loop. The main topic will be monetary policy and expectations going forward.\u00a0\n\nSPY is trading a bit over 468. After some choppiness in yesterday's session, I'll be watching for more of the same today. If we see weakness, I'll be watching the SMA(9) as potential support at around \\~467.28. DIA is trading just over 356. I'll be watching 356 and 354 as potential support levels, but we could see more weakness after dropping down below the SMA(9) in yesterday's trading. QQQ\u00a0is\u00a0trading a bit over 403. Tech stocks are holding up well compared to the overall market, but I still think we have some choppiness ahead. Gold\u00a0is up a bit this morning, while silver is down. Crude oil broke down below the $80 level and is seeing more weakness this morning. We could see a retrace back towards the $70 level in the near future. Bitcoin is currently trading around 57,500. After pulling back a bit over the past few days, I'll be watching the 59,000-60,000 level as potential resistance now. Relevant support down around 54,000-55,000. Crypto-related stocks\u00a0are a bit mixed at the moment after the recent weakness in crypto. Airlines and cruise stocks are down in premarket and could see continued weakness.\u00a0\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",

        "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 15th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures up 100 points after market breaks a 5-week winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were slightly higher in early morning trading on Monday as investors prepared to start the week after the S&amp;P 500 broke a five-week winning streak.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures gained 137 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each up about 0.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla shares fell 2% premarket Monday following a weekend Twitter exchange between founder Elon Musk and Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period,\u201d the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats wrote.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI keep forgetting that you\u2019re still alive,\u201d Musk responded. In a follow-up tweet, he said, \u201cWant me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word \u2026\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Dow component ExxonMobil saw its shares under pressure, falling nearly 1% premarket as West Texas Intermediate oil futures slipped more than 1% to fall just under $80 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Also on the bluechip index, Boeing rose nearly 3% following news that Saudi Arabian Airlines is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a wide-body jet order. At the same time, Emirates announced an order for two Boeing 777 Freighters at the 2021 Dubai Airshow.\n*****\n&gt; Dollar Tree shares gained 7% premarket following a report Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has taken a stake worth at least $1.8 billion in the discount store chain and will push it to do more to add to shareholder value.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are coming off a losing week after last month\u2019s consumer price index made its largest annual increase in more than three decades. The major averages snapped a five-week winning streak.\n*****\n&gt; Markets digested a range of economic news last week showing that inflation was rising even more than expected and workers continued to quit their jobs in search of better opportunities.\n*****\n&gt; That data \u201cadded to concerns that inflation at a 30-year high could indeed remain a stickier problem and challenge for businesses, consumers and monetary policy makers to contend with over the next four to six months or even longer\u201d John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said in a note Monday. He said he expects inflation to dampen, however.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPositive offsets to the current waves of inflation hitting the U.S. economy at this time are likely to emerge as the effects of what may have been overstimulation of the economy at the height of the pandemic fade,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Investors this week will get a look at how much consumers are spending when retail sales data drops Tuesday, while housing numbers come Wednesday with new construction starts and building permits. This also will be a busy week for the Federal Reserve, with multiple officials scheduled to speak through the week.\n*****\n&gt; Also, the Labor Department reported that a record 4.4 million workers left their jobs in September, generally that they can get something better. Consumer confidence, though, dipped to a 10-year low in November, as consumers apparently flush with cash are growing more worried about inflation.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s CPI jumped 6.2% from a year ago, well above the 5.9% estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones. The index, which tracks a basket of consumer products, increased 0.9% on a month-over-month basis, also hotter than expected.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.6% and the S&amp;P 500 eased 0.3% last week. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was the main underperformer, dropping 0.7% as rising bond yields dented growth pockets of the market.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; Also denting sentiment was a report that workers left their jobs in record numbers in September, with 4.43 million people quitting, the Labor Department reported Friday. The exodus occurred as the U.S. had 10.44 million employment openings that month, according to the report.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are not far from their record highs. The Dow is 1.3% off its all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq sit 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, away from their records.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will be focused on Tuesday\u2019s retail sales report and several major retailers\u2019 earnings this week. Walmart and Home Depot release results on Tuesday, and Target and Lowe\u2019s report on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, President Joe Biden will host a bipartisan bill signing ceremony for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/4K259Wf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LaHHyi6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/KC19Cyv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/yQ1JG6k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($BABA $NVDA $WMT $TSN $TGT $HD $LCID $SE $RAIL $M $AMAT $LOW $BIDU $JD $OEG $GMBL $ZIM $OTLY $CSCO $HHR $POWW $RMBL $TJX $KSS $FL $STNE $BFLY $WMG $IDEX $JMIA $KLIC $SONO $ACM $IQ $BILI $VBLT $PTN $KALA $NTES $CSIQ $CMAX $AAP)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($TSN $RAIL $OTLY $OEG $BFLY $HHR $RMBL $WMG $ACM $KALA $TRVN $VBLT $CMAX $GREE $URGN $SOHU $TLS $YOU $AVPT $PTN $PLX $ACRX $MLSS $PHGE $PRTH $BMTX $BCU $VVNT $IMPL $AREC $INFU $ATAI $ADN $CVSI $GMDA $ONDS $BDSX $CLSN $AMPY $DDL)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JxGBuZv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/JCZtUkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/iTxfRD7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/p8UZ1fQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Yrciygm.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jzKLP6G.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/tb2QzPA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* GGPI\n* MARA\n* TLRY\n* RIOT\n* AVPT\n* BFLY\n* DRUG\n* OTLY\n* GREE\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-oatly-tesla-dollar-tree-and-more-.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Oatly (OTLY)** \u2013 The oat milk producer lost 7 cents per share for its latest quarter, smaller than the 10 cents a share loss anticipated by analysts.

I was not, before today, inclined to treat today as a buying opportunity before some heavyweights I like report (NVDA, AMAT). That\u2019s because I expect retail earnings and guidance to be a drag on markets next week.\n\nBut I could be wrong on that front if disappointing tape in retail drives people back into growth stocks.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 16th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are flat as investors evaluate big retail earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained after better-than-expected results from Walmart and Home Depot.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow, which contains the two big retailers, added 70 points, or 0.19%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly in the red.\n*****\n&gt; Walmart kicked off a busy week of retail earnings by saying third-quarter profit and revenue was well above estimates with U.S. same-store sales jumping 9.2%, excluding fuel. The company also raised its forecast for 2021, saying adjusted earnings per share will be around $6.40 versus its prior expectations of between $6.20 and $6.35. The shares moved slighly lower in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Home Depot gained more than 1%, however, after its third-quarter earnings beat estimates on a 9.8% sales burst.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales figures for October came in 1.7% higher than 0.7% in September, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected sales to have jumped by 1.5%.\n*****\n&gt; Industrial production numbers will also be released Tuesday, as well as the NAHB housing market index survey.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Monday, the Dow dipped about 13 points, or 0.04%, for its fourth negative session in the last five. At the high of the day the 30-stock index gained about 136 points. The S&amp;P 500 finished the day unchanged at 4,682.87. The benchmark index moved between gains and losses during the session, at one point gaining 0.3%, while also trading 0.21% lower. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.04%. The Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer, declining 0.45%.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks\u2019 move came as interest rates rose, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note topping 1.62% while the 30-bear Treasury bond rose above 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation fears are weighing on the market after last month\u2019s consumer price index posted its largest annual increase in more than three decades. Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he believes inflation will moderate in 2022, but that \u201cthe path to lower inflation [will] begin with higher inflation in the front half of the year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe stickier drivers of inflation are likely to persist, but our base case is that they will not outweigh the improvement we expect in the transitory elements,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday afternoon President Joe Biden signed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. The package includes funding for transportation, broadband and utilities.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages are coming off their first negative week in six, but stocks are still trading around all-time high levels. As Wall Street strategists look to 2022 some, including Morgan Stanley\u2019s Michael Wilson, believe the picture looks muted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith financial conditions tightening and earnings growth slowing, the 12-month risk/reward for the broad indices looks unattractive at current prices,\u201d he said Monday in a note to clients. \u201cHowever, strong nominal GDP growth should continue to provide plenty of good investment opportunities at the stock level for active managers,\u201d he added. His 12-month base target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,400, which is 6% below where the index closed on Monday.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/e1OFise.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7RKeZdA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/s5Dygpo.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PEb1Dek.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/w4BQNv2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($BABA $NVDA $WMT $TSN $TGT $HD $LCID $SE $RAIL $M $AMAT $LOW $BIDU $JD $OEG $GMBL $ZIM $OTLY $CSCO $HHR $POWW $RMBL $TJX $KSS $FL $STNE $BFLY $WMG $IDEX $JMIA $KLIC $SONO $ACM $IQ $BILI $VBLT $PTN $KALA $NTES $CSIQ $CMAX $AAP)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($WMT $HD $SE $JMIA $NTES $DAVA $ARMK $DG $FUV $AQUA $DOYU $HIVE $OCSL $GDS $ITRN $RSKD $DAO $ESEA $BNR $ECC $CWCO $GFF $MDWD $AUVI $VOD $AIH $REAX $ONON $OMQS $IPHA $LILM)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7zroWVL.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gnlJVdh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qIEmQpP.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Iy86h4x.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Fqns3OU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VGnIgIv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ZYhMgYe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/iuwJ5rI.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MtgFBmW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/pHS6FXe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uNtzOap.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* MARA\n* GGPI\n* VGX.X\n* NIO\n* TSLA\n* AMC\n* CRWD\n* POWW\n* BLNK\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-rackspace-technology-axon-enterprise-royalty-pharma-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Rackspace Technology (RXT)** \u2013 Rackspace beat estimates by a penny a share, with quarterly earnings of 25 cents per share.

S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading has been choppy this week with the major averages mostly wavering around the flat line, but the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are still on track for a positive week and are sitting less than 1% from their records. The Dow is 1.7% from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Nvidia shares popped more than 8% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results and issued a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter ending in January. The chipmaker reporter a 55% gain in data center sales from the same period a year ago and its biggest market, gaming, reported a 42% sales increase.\n*****\n&gt; Those gains helped lift other chip stocks in early morning trading. Advanced Micro Devices gained 2% while Skyworks and Micron Technology added more than 1%.\n*****\n&gt; Retail continued its big earnings week. Shares of Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s kicked the day off jumping 11% and 7%, respectively. Both companies smashed quarterly profit and revenue estimates, much like its peers who reported earlier in the week. Most have reported same-store sales gains from the previous year and investors are optimistic going into the holiday shopping season.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere, Deere saw its shares rise more than 1% after it came to a resolution with workers who had been on strike since Oct. 14.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing also saw its shares rise another almost 2% following on upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the aerospace giant has significant upside as it clears up several issues that have dogged the company.\n*****\n&gt; Going in the other direction, Cisco Systems fell 5% due to weaker revenue guidance and a revenue miss. Kraft Heinz shares also dropped more than 2% after the company announced a secondary offering of common stock.\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 211 points, dragged down by a 4.7% loss in Visa shares. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.26%. The Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.33% lower, despite most mega-cap technology companies closing in the green.\n*****\n&gt; The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer on Wednesday, dropping 1.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRecent economic reports remain strong, but today\u2019s stock market action highlights that it is already discounting another Covid cycle,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cConcerns about Covid also caused the 10-year bond yield to decline for the first time in 6 days and kept downward pressure on commodity prices including another sizable drop in crude oil prices. If inflation keeps rising while another Covid surge again stalls real economic activity, we may find out how the stock market handles a pseudo-stagflationary episode,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; Investors await more retail earnings on Thursday with Applied Materials and Palo Alto Networks reporting after the bell.\n*****\n&gt; The Labor Department will report last week\u2019s jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting initial filings for unemployment insurance fell to 260,000 for the week ending November 13, from the previous week\u2019s 267,000 claims.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/ZIQbVzs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nbs6n3M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/YPFLg0Q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/sphxmmg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($BABA $NVDA $WMT $TSN $TGT $HD $LCID $SE $RAIL $M $AMAT $LOW $BIDU $JD $OEG $GMBL $ZIM $OTLY $CSCO $HHR $POWW $RMBL $TJX $KSS $FL $STNE $BFLY $WMG $IDEX $JMIA $KLIC $SONO $ACM $IQ $BILI $VBLT $PTN $KALA $NTES $CSIQ $CMAX $AAP)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($BABA $M $JD $KSS $CSIQ $WOOF $BJ $VIPS $WLMS $PLCE $HP $AZEK $ATHM $BPC $MMS $ONEW $GAMB $NJR $BERY $KNOP $RERE $YSG $BLRX $PAX $HMLP $MNSO $AVAL $PTLO)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Q2yy2jJ.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2l2m1qw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ihtHHa3.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gv1vdEt.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MBxyvVe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/JofUtHR.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/eKYKA2k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/Q5l4QGo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BABA\n* CLOV\n* NVDA\n* SEV\n* M\n* JD\n* RKLB\n* PTLO\n* CRDF\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-alibaba-jdcom-cisco-nvidia-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Macy\u2019s (M)** \u2013 Macy\u2019s surged 8% in the premarket after the retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit, and raised its full-year outlook.

S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.\n*****\n&gt; Home improvement giant Lowe\u2019s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.\n*****\n&gt; Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion.

The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.\n*****\n&gt; Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUS stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.\n*****\n&gt; Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath &amp; Body Works and Victoria\u2019s Secret.

S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading has been choppy this week with the major averages mostly wavering around the flat line, but the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are still on track for a positive week and are sitting less than 1% from their records. The Dow is 1.7% from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Nvidia shares popped more than 8% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results and issued a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter ending in January. The chipmaker reporter a 55% gain in data center sales from the same period a year ago and its biggest market, gaming, reported a 42% sales increase.\n*****\n&gt; Those gains helped lift other chip stocks in early morning trading. Advanced Micro Devices gained 2% while Skyworks and Micron Technology added more than 1%.\n*****\n&gt; Retail continued its big earnings week. Shares of Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s kicked the day off jumping 11% and 7%, respectively. Both companies smashed quarterly profit and revenue estimates, much like its peers who reported earlier in the week. Most have reported same-store sales gains from the previous year and investors are optimistic going into the holiday shopping season.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere, Deere saw its shares rise more than 1% after it came to a resolution with workers who had been on strike since Oct. 14.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing also saw its shares rise another almost 2% following on upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the aerospace giant has significant upside as it clears up several issues that have dogged the company.\n*****\n&gt; Going in the other direction, Cisco Systems fell 5% due to weaker revenue guidance and a revenue miss. Kraft Heinz shares also dropped more than 2% after the company announced a secondary offering of common stock.\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 211 points, dragged down by a 4.7% loss in Visa shares. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.26%. The Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.33% lower, despite most mega-cap technology companies closing in the green.\n*****\n&gt; The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer on Wednesday, dropping 1.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRecent economic reports remain strong, but today\u2019s stock market action highlights that it is already discounting another Covid cycle,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cConcerns about Covid also caused the 10-year bond yield to decline for the first time in 6 days and kept downward pressure on commodity prices including another sizable drop in crude oil prices. If inflation keeps rising while another Covid surge again stalls real economic activity, we may find out how the stock market handles a pseudo-stagflationary episode,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; Investors await more retail earnings on Thursday with Applied Materials and Palo Alto Networks reporting after the bell.\n*****\n&gt; The Labor Department will report last week\u2019s jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 19, 2021**\n\nThe stock market traded mixed today, with the both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) slipping whiled the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed on the day, driven higher by a strong performance in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.\n\nNotable Numbers Today\n\n* SPY: -0.19%\n* QQQ: +0.56%\n* DIA: -0.76%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%\n* Apple (AAPL): +1.70%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%\n* Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%\n* PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%\n\nMarkets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. \n\nJim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said \u201calthough all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said \u201cJust like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.\n\nAdding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. \n\nYesterday, the Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The FDA approved boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE, BNTX) and Moderna (MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines for all adults in the US.\n* Apple regained the mantle of most valuable company from Microsoft, with the company reaching a fresh all-time high today\n* After a pop in the beginning of November, weed stocks continued their steep declines as nationwide legalization efforts in the US continue to falter. The largest fund tracking the pot industry, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) tumbled to its lowest price since last year and is down 60% from its high in February.\n* As talked about yesterday, Apple (AAPL) is reportedly accelerating development on its fully autonomous Apple Car, set to debut in 2025. A Morgan Stanley analyst said the car would double revenues and market value.\n* The Pentagon announced it has issued formal solicitations to Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Oracle (ORCL) for a multibillion-dollar cloud-computing contract to replace the JEDI procurement, which became mired in litigation between Microsoft and Amazon and objections from Congress.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with a host of target raises following its earnings report.

No sign-ups, no middle man, instant withdrawals &amp; no wondering if your funds are safe.\n* Value Network's smart contract code is fully audited by [Certik](https://www.certik.org/projects/valuenetwork)\n\n**Main functions:**\n\nAsset price predictions: Users predict whether the price of a cryptocurrency pair will be higher or lower at a specific moment. By design, users place bets against each other; funds are placed in a pool, and on settlement, winnings are disbursed among predictors.\n\n**On-Chain Strategies:**\n\nUsers create a prediction strategy in the form of a smart contract on [app.valuenetwork.live](https://app.valuenetwork.live/) platform; then other users can decide to pool funds into the strategy and follow his strategy and try to repeat his forecast with any amount of money. If the creator's forecast strategy is correct, he gets 20% from the winnings.\n\nWe have created Value Network integrating QTUM Blockchain, Binance Smart Chain and implemented Chainlink as the price oracle.\n\nCurrently, users can place predictions on the testnet before finally making predictions using real crypto!\n\n**Head on to** [**app.valuenetwork.live**](https://app.valuenetwork.live/) **NOW!

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # 2. Social Metaverse Investing\n\nYou know, before formally introducing this writing, I have to admit that there is a particular challenge when it comes to writing this book and that is modifying for correct predictions or fundamental market shifts. This statement existed in the financial technology chapter but makes more sense to move up  here in the technology introduction where we discuss the evolution of social media. That is because the subject of conversation for the next few years will be the metaverse or the third iteration of the internet. This subject of conversation was essentially referenced in this chapter but the information is far more clear now and requires this final edit or revision. So let's begin.\n\nIt likely makes sense to discuss and break down what a social network really is since it is something that has significantly changed human behavior. I like to invest in what I frame as intent-based social media and this is likely a function of my age and relationship with the internet. An intent-based social media platform is a network where the user is likely to use the application as a tool before considering entertainment. In short, social media exists on a spectrum ranging from intention to entertainment. One could see how a platform like TikTok is geared toward entertainment, while a platform like Pinterest is designed for intention. In this spectrum, we find many others in the middle like YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.\n\nThis spectrum is critical to understand because it governs what kind of algorithms are used to drive the platform. In the case of entertainment-based media, like Instagram or TikTok, the platform seeks to understand the user so that it can fetch content that will entertain them. Entertainment is a highly subjective endeavor which forces the platforms to depend on algorithms to connect users and content. It is the open field form. On the other side, the intent-based platform serves a designed function and relationship with the content creator. For example, we visit Pinterest to create useful ideas, allowing content-creators to focus on the context of the platform. Google indexes websites so that users can portal into a library of website owners and services. Reddit curates loyal communities to drive its information and space.\n\nThe critical element of this spectrum is the complex conversations that drive privacy and security on platforms. Social media is how we interface with the internet and it is what we refer to as the second iteration of the internet. To briefly shift the tone of this conversation, the entertainment platform suffer from misinformation and propaganda driven campaigns. This is a natural consequence of relying on algorithms that depend on short and effective messaging and may ultimately affect intent-based platforms that orbit closer to entertainment, like Reddit or Youtube. They are called Influencers after all. The conversations surrounding privacy ultimately discuss these worst-case scenarios, so they're important to be mindful of historically and forward-looking.\n\nWith this issue highlighted, I would like to admit that one of my prediction about Facebook was correct. It will exist in social media forever, due to most applications using Facebook's software development ecosystems to create websites and applications on any device. This is similar to how Oracle will essentially exist forever as part of the computing world due to its widespread demand for system maintenance and improvements. This is set in stone and Facebook's drive for the metaverse ultimately points to how the leadership behind Facebook understands that social media is a forum that ebbs and flows with the population over time. So let's explore the thinking behind the leading social media platform and why it knows how to navigate and pivot its product over the years and how it lead to Roblox becoming Facebook's primary competitor for the next decade by examining Pinterest so that we can understand what social media truly is as a first generation investor.\n\nA social media platform is a forum. A forum is a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged. Each forum accomplishes this in its own unique way.  Twitter is fundamentally used to search for what someone is saying, while Pinterest is used to search for ideas. Pinterest is a particularly interesting case due to hundreds of millions of women adopting the platform and achieving what Google+ had failed to accomplish - a social media platform that harnesses the power of search. I believe this is also an interesting examination of how influential women are to the market. One can question if Apple or Google would be as successful as they are without the seismic changes that the American workforce has adapted.\n\nThis spectrum distinction continues be important when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat because an investor would not want to mistake the differences between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart. So is Pinterest a social media platform, search service, or both? With this in mind, we might begin to see why Facebook implementing a hashtag, Instagram implementation stories, or TikTok implementing streams may be irrelevant when understanding the full potential of a service like Snapchat or Twitter and the wisdoms the drive its growth in the market. Before ever investing in a company you need to discover and completely understand the incentives that drive the customers to return to the product. Without that, you are ultimately gambling in the market and driving through a fog hoping that things will turn out well.\n\nWhat drives a social networking site is a user\u2019s incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is best served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.\n\nThe forum may take on a different medium. Google is used to answer information, Facebook allows us to connect, while online gaming satisfies our needs for adventure. When you examine the nature of a forum and a user\u2019s incentive to participate in that forum, you\u2019ll come to understand why a applications like Twitter, Pinterest, or online games like Roblox are a force of nature. These forums engage and fulfill our very real needs and demands as social beings. It will also help you understand why companies like Facebook would endeavor in metaverse products like virtual reality games and other forms of social media.\n\nPinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or Reddit, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. This is what is known as \u201cpersonal media\u201d rather than typical \u201csocial media\u201d. This is a characteristic that I believe grants a media platform a longer product lifespan. It will also be quite relevant when it comes to conversations about how users interact with the metaverse. Clearly, there will be users that enjoy the extroverted elements of it, while introverted users may prefer the personal media aspects of it. What I try to imagine is that the Instagram \"mall\" may be a more social space than the Pinterest \"mall\" in the metaverse.\n\nThe network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in is word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine rather than an application to connect with friends or family. As a result, Pinterest\u2019s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.  This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption. Most American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users.  \n\nThese customers are voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest\u2019s customers are in a high willingness to engage with things that result in action. In other words, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future. Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is effectively a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they\u2019re getting top \"real estate\" advertisements. With a simple search, you\u2019re welcomed to a rich library of consumable ideas for health, gifts, beauty, travelling, home developments, and millions of other regularly marketed products that influence the home.\n\nPinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the platform as a power tool. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different from Facebook\u2019s connect-everything approach to social-networking. It is less wasteful and more effective.\n\nYou may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new. As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less \"the web\", where website links are the lifeblood to Google search. A good link is extremely valuable to Google.\n\nDue to this relationship, it is in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best, fastest, and most well-rounded results. This means that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.  This partially explains why searching for \"Lebron James\" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites.  Similarly, searching for \"Vegan food near me\" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.\n\nThere are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb; the more well-developed a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of well-developed changes. An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develop tools like in-app browsers and support integration with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader of the internet. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet\u2019s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately the access to information, which is as statistically scarce as the access to clean water and sanitation around the globe. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.\n\nI totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life and scale as one of the most valuable internet properties similar to how Roblox breeched the family household and maintained relevancy over the years. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest and things like Roblox are a reliable and effective advertising space.\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I regularly seek to delete it. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest, I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. And Facebook is pivoting itself to exist in such a way that it is impossible to delete. That, to me, is incredible.",

Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader of the internet. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet\u2019s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately the access to information, which is as statistically scarce as the access to clean water and sanitation around the globe. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.\n\nI totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life and scale as one of the most valuable internet properties similar to how Roblox breeched the family household and maintained relevancy over the years. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest and things like Roblox are a reliable and effective advertising space.\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I regularly seek to delete it. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest, I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. And Facebook is pivoting itself to exist in such a way that it is impossible to delete. That, to me, is incredible.",
