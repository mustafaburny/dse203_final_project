        "selftext": " I don't get what you guys are worried about with PLTR.\n\nHere's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.\n\nFears preventing you from buying PLTR\n\n1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven\n2. Shills spamming \"pLtR tO tHe MoOn\" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.\n3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.\n4. Financials Moving Forwards\n5. Soros who owns 21 million shares \"threatening\" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.\n6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.\n7. What does PLTR tldr.\n8. Other Information\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#1 Targeted Ads***\n\nAds and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.\n\nAds are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.\n\nTo me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**\n\nAdditionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#2 Shilling PLTR***\n\nI myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.\n\nShillery is OK, but at least give the facts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***\n\nIf you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's \"bad\" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.\n\n**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n&gt;We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nI would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.\n\n*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.\n\n* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \\~260 million.***\n* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \\~987 million.***\n\nADDITIONALLY...\n\nPLTR also had a higher R&amp;D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&amp;D, but somehow ended up paying \\~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n&gt;On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***\n\nPLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.\n\nHere's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:\n\n1. CDC\n2. Office of the Secretary\n3. Food and Drug Administration\n4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE\n5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS\n6. National Institute on Drug Abuse\n7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground\n8. Coast Guard / DHS\n9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command\n10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ\n11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS\n\nBoys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.\n\n***UPCOMING EARNINGS***\n\nI've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.\n\n***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nNow, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.\n\nI've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&amp;D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.\n\n***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nSome people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)\n\nIn my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.\n\nThere is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.\n\n***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***\n\nShort answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.\n\n*Processing img ba58nqcurob61...*\n\nPalantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.\n\nMithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.\n\nProspectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\nI suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.\n\n**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***\n\nFirst of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.\n\nIf you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.\n\nWhether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.\n\nNothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.\n\nPLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***\n\nTo my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:\n\n* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.\n* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.\n\nThere's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \\~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.\n\nWhen those shares are \"unlocked\" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.\n\n&gt;According to [Palantir\u2019s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.\n\nWhat **WILL** affect stock price:\n\n* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.\n* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.\n\n*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*\n\nWhat **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:\n\n* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.\n* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)\n* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.\n* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.\n* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***\n\nImagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone &amp; Youtube's Database of everything &amp; Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.\n\nPalantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.\n\nIt's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.\n\nLiterally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.\n\nWhile this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.\n\ntldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.\n\n**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**\n\nGovernments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.\n\nGovernments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.\n\n**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.\n\nPLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#8 Other Information***\n\n***\\*\\*Big known PLTR Holders\\*\\****\n\n*Processing img a404oalxrob61...*\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR's Price List (2019)\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186](https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Personal TA and Crayon Mania\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR stock pumping events\\*\\****\n\n* 7'th Jan - Interview\n* 26'th Jan - Demonstration\n* 11'th Feb - Earnings\n* \\~15'th Feb - DPO expiration - Havoc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Similar Companies\\*\\****\n\n* PLTR - Palantir - Stock Price \\~$25 - Market Cap 48bln\n* AYX - Alteryx - Stock Price \\~$125 - Market Cap 8bln\n* Semantic Research - Private\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Known Contract Info\\*\\****\n\n* 240 million Palantir Air Force contract expiring soon in 3 months.

I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.\n\nAlso yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.\n\nI've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.\n\nI come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.\n\nMy PT's for PLTR are:\n\n* 48-89 by March or April.\n* 75 - 125 by EOY.\n* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&amp;D cost issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0k1ujprob61.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b3a16265edafa290432e6b79f9009e3df99f495",

        "selftext": "Normally I don\u2019t do this kind of thing, but I\u2019ve had far too much wine, just enough weed, and I\u2019m feeling kinda jolly this evening, so let me spit some knowledge for my fellow Retards about everyone\u2019s favorite eye in the sky these days: Palantir. The employee lockout is coming on Jan 26th, and it will be a buying opportunity, because Palantir\u2019s is \ud83d\ude80going \ud83d\ude80to \ud83d\ude80the \ud83c\udf46fuckin\u2019 \ud83c\udf16moon, boys. Get your helmets on, and strap in. This \ud83d\ude80rocket\u2019s about to blast off.\n\nPalantir\u2019s pretty well-established in the Data Analytics community with Big Government contracts pouring money into it's R&amp;D projects. You don\u2019t need to turn a profit when the Government uses you for their skunkworks dept. Especially this early on the explosion of industry that is Surveillance.\n\nSpeaking of surveillance... let\u2019s take a little walk down memory lane, shall we. Y\u2019all remember Barack Obama, right? Tan suit? Dijon mustard? The guy who [wrote annual Presidential Executive Orders declaring a continued State of National Emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_United_States) that brought us the NSA cell phone bullshit, along with all the other erosions of our privacy we are now totally accustomed to, and largely gave us the rise of Mass Surveillance? Turns out, ol' Barry had some pretty colorful characters working for him. One of those characters was this total badass named [Avril Haines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Haines)\n\nIf you don\u2019t know about her, [you should.](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/939722113/the-winding-journey-of-avril-haines-bidens-pick-to-lead-u-s-intelligence) Again, because she\u2019s a badass. Studied Judo in Japan, apparently became bored with that at some point and casually studied theoretical physics at University of Chicago. Somehow that wasn\u2019t exciting enough for her, so in her down time, she ended up buying a used-up, junk-ass Cessna airplane, and rebuilt the avionics herself. Once that little weekend project was completed, she tried to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and crash-landed near the Newfoundland coast. No shit. I mean, who does that?! A badass judo hobbyist who dabbles in theoretical physics, that\u2019s who. Now, she did crash, yes, but: her co-pilot ended up falling in love and wife\u2019in the shit out of her. I mean, can you blame the guy? They cuddled for awhile and opened up a little bookstore in the ghetto of Baltimore, hoping the danger of a drug riddled city could hold her lust for excitement and adventure. Shocker: it couldn\u2019t.\n\nBy the early 2000\u2019s, she was bouncing around government jobs doing lawyer stuff, and that\u2019s when she met Joe Biden. Several high-profile positions followed, but the one I want to focus on happens in 2010, when she gets a seat at the table to be Deputy National Security advisor. Three years later? [She replaced Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy and former acting director.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cias-deputy-director-to-be-replaced-with-white-house-lawyer/2013/06/12/8fc2118e-d383-11e2-8cbe-1bcbee06f8f8_story.html)\n\nThat\u2019s right, you heard me. The CIA.\n\nSpeaking of Joe Biden... guess who he just nominated to be the Director of National Security?. If you said Avril Haines, you get a good star.\n\u201cDaegoba; what the fuuuuck does this have to do with Palantir?\u201d Well... do any of you degenerates know who was the first investor in Palantir? [A little company called In-Q-Tel; the venture capital firm of the CIA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel) They kicked Thiel [a cool $2 million waaaaaay back in 2003, just as he got the company off the ground.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)\n\nNow, wouldn\u2019t it stand to reason that maybe, just maybe, it would be a safe bet to assume that the company who helped kill Osama bin Laden, with all these old friends getting together to run the US Government over the next few years, will see a little bit of success? You think!?\n\nIf this isn\u2019t your next big play over the long term, I don\u2019t know if you should full send your window licking hobby and surrender your RH account to your wife's boyfriend. Palantir will be a giant in the next two years at the very least, and a Juggernaut in Data Analytics long into the foreseeable future.\n\nNow, go. Invest in Palantir, and retire early. You\u2019re welcome.\n\n#GMEgang\n\n**HOLD THE LINE**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16\ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf16",

Your a chump if you answered phones.\n\nTLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.\n\n**Software**\n\nBlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves.

Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue.

(NYSE: AMC) and other securities that are being heavily shorted by institutional investors.  \n\nRecently,  retail investors have turned the tables on Wall Street by buying up  stocks heavily shorted by hedge funds such as Melvin Capital, causing  increased volatility and short-squeeze losses to these institutional  investors.  However, on January 28th, Robinhood announced  that retail investors could no longer purchase certain stocks and raised  margin requirements for certain securities.\n\nThe inability to  trade shares has sparked outrage across social media, as users took to  Twitter to vent their frustrations, stating:\n\n\"You can no longer buy GameStop stock on Robinhood. Ditto Nokia, AMC, and all the other stocks that had been shorted.\"\n\nAnother said: \"The free market is only free until rich people lose money.\"\n\nIn  response to these actions, Dave Portnoy, the founder of the sports and  pop culture blog Barstool Sports, released a series of tweets  questioning Robinhood's integrity and agenda. He called for retail  investors not to close their positions. \n\nOn January 28, AMC was down 60% amid the Robinhood restrictions.\n\nTo learn more about this investigation and your rights if you believe you have suffered losses, **go to**: [https://www.zlk.com/pslra-1/amc-retail-brokers-class-action-information-request-form](https://www.zlk.com/pslra-1/amc-retail-brokers-class-action-information-request-form)\n\nLevi  &amp; Korsinsky is a nationally recognized firm with offices in New  York, Connecticut, California, and Washington D.C.

        "selftext": "I am not a financial Advisor, and I\u2019m not your Papa. Do your own due diligence!\n\n# Thesis\n\nWe are knee deep in this quarantine, and solid quarantine plays that aren\u2019t already coming off of huge momentum, are hard to come by. But I believe this could be an exception. Every stay-at-home dot com online ecommerce platform has been sky-rocketed and flowers.com (1800flowers.com) at first glance seems no different. Trading at about $26 with ATH at $32 in August. But, I believe the market may not have factored in just how much flowers.com is benefitting.\n\nFirst and foremost this was brought to my attention at work. I\u2019m a courier(for one of the major shippers), and I check every package that comes through there. Over the past couple months, I\u2019ve been watching as flowers.com packages have been noticeably growing in volume. The hypothesis is simple:\n\nAt a time when you are not able to see friends and loved ones flowers and gift boxes are a way to convey, I love you, I miss you, Thinking of you, Sorry for your loss, Get better soon, Congratulations, Happy Anniversary, and Condolences, while we have the inability to do so in person. What do you get grandma in the nursing home, who doesn\u2019t need anything, or the relative who\u2019s got everything? Or an office that worked through quarantine?\n\nIt\u2019s as pure as it comes too. Flowers.com has pretty much dominated and monopolized the market for online flowers and gift boxes with the acquisition of competitors. Recently expanding with another HCT Mention BBBY, acquiring personalizationmall.com, that allows pretty much any gift/wedding/keepsake to be personalized(although there is some ongoing issues with this acquisition due to pandemic).\n\nThey also purchased Sheri\u2019s Berries, [www.berries.com/](http://www.berries.com/) a chocolate dipped fruit gift company. The list goes on and on, with baskets.com, simplychocolate.com, fruitbouquets.com, cheryls.com(cookies), thepopcornfactory.com, a premium meats service\u2026 baked goods\u2026 enough said. But out of all of those, the big kicker for me is Harry and David\u2019s(\\*\\*which I would love to get web traffic for too\\*\\*), which is a gourmet gift box. I saw a noticeable amount of Harry and David packages going out to homes and business over the last four weeks of holidays, almost matching volume with flowers.com.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6k3hoblsg2b61.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1360ca9f02cd427a80e11f84b42e5774114debbd\n\nEarly on, I couldn\u2019t find the g trends to support my growing hypothesis, but now that seems to have shifted and the data has had time to mature, I believe flowers.com is seeing a huge spike in sales growth.\n\n[It may be hard to tell but searches yoy for all trends is up.  ](https://preview.redd.it/u9c9xltvg2b61.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8213167d74e443e0042f2bda38ab4e4bf4d61070)\n\n[Web traffic is up. The spikes are yearly occurrences, but are up yoy, and the overall upward momentum is positive.

Last earnings was a beat, and some of this growth has been factored into upcoming earnings, no doubt about that. But as with any social arb trade, one of the questions is: Is the market fully appreciating the trend?\n\nI don\u2019t believe it has, and I believe there is room to run up and past ATH\u2019s. With a very good outlook for an upcoming earnings beat, this seems like a pure play with solid gains potential and little downside risk.\n\nUpcoming earnings are scheduled for the end of January and Flowers.com and its subsidiaries have a clear market dominance to capitalize on a holiday season in quarantine.\n\n# Trades made\n\nIt\u2019s a cyclical play and I\u2019m in through earnings with around 3-4% of portfolio in equity, which I will build on any further dips to 8% of total portfolio.\n\nI will add in calls on any down day through earnings in the same manner.\n\nJust gut-based speculation here, but I believe it could pull back to the median range of 24-25$ before hitting an upswing, if so I will be aggressively building out my position.\n\nThere is also a solid argument to be made that this could be a solid long-term play as well with continuous growth over the next 3-5 years.\n\n# Research\n\n[https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2020/1-800-flowers-buys-bed-bath-beyond-personalization-mall/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2020/1-800-flowers-buys-bed-bath-beyond-personalization-mall/) (aquisition of BBBY division, Personalizationmall.com)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bed-bath-1800-flowers-com-lawsuit-idUSKBN21K3B8](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bed-bath-1800-flowers-com-lawsuit-idUSKBN21K3B8) (a lawsuit over personalizationmall.com just for balance)\n\n# Credit\n\nSpecial thanks to **TraderJohsaphat**,  Neppah Ti Tel, Cam10 and DanN, tillatron14, DM cmt. for dd/additional support.",

        "selftext": " Good day fellow SPAC investors. I am back with another company trading close to Nav that I think has immense potential to find the next Palantir. I am hoping to generate some discussion around this and get others thoughts on this company. As always, I am by no means an expert, so do your own due diligence.\n\n**NSH - NavSight Holdings, Inc. - 10.21**\n\n**Why I invested:** The leadership of this SPAC is dominated by multiple people who have spent their careers working in national security as well as providing differentiated expertise and technology to U.S. government customers in support of their national security, intelligence, and defense missions.They have worked at top government agencies in this area including the NSA, have grown businesses in the space and have invested in many others. In doing this, they obviously have developed an extensive network of contacts and relationships which will provide substantial sources of acquisition opportunities. They should have a lot of insight into finding an ideal SPAC that will hopefully be successful and provide a great return to investors. For me, this is a company that could invest in the next Palantir and I am hopeful that it will be something that I can hold long after the merger. My guess is that this will be in the cybersecurity space based on the leadership\u2019s past experience. I have little doubt that they won\u2019t find an ideal target as this is such a niche market that other SPACs are not targeting and the management team has so much experience in it. \n\n**IPOSize:** $230M\n\n**Target:** US government national security, intelligence and defence vendors in the tech space.\n\nCompanies that:\n\n* Are differentiated expertise and technology to U.S. government customers in support of their **national security, intelligence and defense** missions.\n* Have a defensible market position, possess a track record of maintaining and growing **long-term customer relationships, and derive a majority of their revenue from prime contracts**;\n* Hold positions on **large multi-year IDIQ (indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity) contracts and programs**, and/or **possess proprietary technology** and and/or can deliver specialized capabilities;\n* Have **sole source positions on high priority and well-funded contracts** and/or programs that can result in above average profitability margins;\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n**Robert A.

        "selftext": "Since we gained a lot of new members over the past 2 weeks I figured it is time to introduce you all to a company that is only at the beginning of its life cycle.\n\nPalantir technologies was started 17 years ago by a seed investment from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA. They absorb the troves of data that people generate and turn that data into actionable items. They are the ones who found Osama Bin Laden, they are Big Brother. \n\nCompanies are accumulating vast amounts of data knowing that one day it will be valuable. I recently read the JetBlue privacy policy while bored on a flight - would have helped if maybe they put some pictures in it. They wanted you to connect your phone to the iPad in the back of the seat to use as a remote. Once you clicked accept on those terms of service, you gave jetblue the right to collect your phones location history, your (well not technically yours, that's why all this is legal) retinal imaging data, facial recognition data, fingerprint data, web browsing history, olfactory data...whatever they want. They place cookies, pixels, web beacons, everything on your phone. FB's new privacy policy allows them to use your camera to see where your eyes go, your account activity for ANY account you log in to (banking info, cell phone records, car payments, onlyfans, brazilian fart porn, whatever youre into). These companies and many governments are building data lakes so that they can begin analyzing that data to see where the goose fits in with the gander.\n\nMany companies have the data, but few have the ability to transform it into something valuable. Peter Thiel, the Don of the PayPal mafia, is a cofounder of this company. His philosophy is that no competition is the best competition. He strives to create monopolies. This industry will be huge, the TAM is hard to estimate but it may extend to even bigger metrics, like national security. The next world war will be a war of information and technology, and the US cant afford to fall behind. \n\nYou know why google is so valuable. They are information brokers. They live and breathe off of collecting your data and selling, because it is very very valuable. Palantir is a multiplier of this value. Their plug and play solutions are an easy value add and save companies from having to create internal divisions of autists that mine this data and maybe turn it into something useful that can generate money.\n\nThis company has potential to be the next Google. They are the first mover, and being private and obscure until they perfected their systems may allow them to become the last mover as well. \n\nThey recently had DPO'ed, preventing the big boys from moving in and buying large portions. Lockup ends 3 days after their upcoming ER. One of our fearless leaders Cathie Wood (btw where can I get an application to be her pool boy) has been steadily accumulating.\n\nThey are positioned to become the standard when talking about big data and AI. I highly recommend you do some research now (maybe start by googling ex employees who are now in high levels of Bidens administration) so that when the tendies have rolled in from GME you know just where to put them and have the conviction (that must be earned, it cant be copied) to hold and fight off Shitron and others who call this one a casino. Plus it has almost 10 million shares short so it is a good opportunity to stick it to the man.\n\nObligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  and may every single one of you retards prevail in the war against Melvin Capital",

        "selftext": " I don't get what you guys are worried about with PLTR.\n\nHere's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.\n\nFears preventing you from buying PLTR\n\n1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven\n2. Shills spamming \"pLtR tO tHe MoOn\" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.\n3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.\n4. Financials Moving Forwards\n5. Soros who owns 21 million shares \"threatening\" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.\n6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.\n7. What does PLTR tldr.\n8. Other Information\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#1 Targeted Ads***\n\nAds and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.\n\nAds are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.\n\nTo me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**\n\nAdditionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#2 Shilling PLTR***\n\nI myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.\n\nShillery is OK, but at least give the facts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***\n\nIf you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's \"bad\" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.\n\n**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n&gt;We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nI would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.\n\n*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.\n\n* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \\~260 million.***\n* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \\~987 million.***\n\nADDITIONALLY...\n\nPLTR also had a higher R&amp;D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&amp;D, but somehow ended up paying \\~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n&gt;On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***\n\nPLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.\n\nHere's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:\n\n1. CDC\n2. Office of the Secretary\n3. Food and Drug Administration\n4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE\n5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS\n6. National Institute on Drug Abuse\n7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground\n8. Coast Guard / DHS\n9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command\n10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ\n11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS\n\nBoys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.\n\n***UPCOMING EARNINGS***\n\nI've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.\n\n***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nNow, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.\n\nI've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&amp;D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.\n\n***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nSome people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)\n\nIn my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.\n\nThere is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.\n\n***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***\n\nShort answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.\n\n*Processing img ba58nqcurob61...*\n\nPalantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.\n\nMithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.\n\nProspectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\nI suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.\n\n**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***\n\nFirst of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.\n\nIf you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.\n\nWhether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.\n\nNothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.\n\nPLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***\n\nTo my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:\n\n* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.\n* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.\n\nThere's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \\~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.\n\nWhen those shares are \"unlocked\" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.\n\n&gt;According to [Palantir\u2019s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.\n\nWhat **WILL** affect stock price:\n\n* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.\n* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.\n\n*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*\n\nWhat **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:\n\n* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.\n* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)\n* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.\n* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.\n* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***\n\nImagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone &amp; Youtube's Database of everything &amp; Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.\n\nPalantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.\n\nIt's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.\n\nLiterally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.\n\nWhile this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.\n\ntldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.\n\n**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**\n\nGovernments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.\n\nGovernments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.\n\n**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.\n\nPLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer.

I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.\n\nAlso yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.\n\nI've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.\n\nI come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.\n\nMy PT's for PLTR are:\n\n* 48-89 by March or April.\n* 75 - 125 by EOY.\n* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&amp;D cost issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0k1ujprob61.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b3a16265edafa290432e6b79f9009e3df99f495",

        "selftext": "Normally I don\u2019t do this kind of thing, but I\u2019ve had far too much wine, just enough weed, and I\u2019m feeling kinda jolly this evening, so let me spit some knowledge for my fellow Retards about everyone\u2019s favorite eye in the sky these days: Palantir. The employee lockout is coming on Jan 26th, and it will be a buying opportunity, because Palantir\u2019s is \ud83d\ude80going \ud83d\ude80to \ud83d\ude80the \ud83c\udf46fuckin\u2019 \ud83c\udf16moon, boys. Get your helmets on, and strap in. This \ud83d\ude80rocket\u2019s about to blast off.\n\nPalantir\u2019s pretty well-established in the Data Analytics community with Big Government contracts pouring money into it's R&amp;D projects. You don\u2019t need to turn a profit when the Government uses you for their skunkworks dept. Especially this early on the explosion of industry that is Surveillance.\n\nSpeaking of surveillance... let\u2019s take a little walk down memory lane, shall we. Y\u2019all remember Barack Obama, right? Tan suit? Dijon mustard? The guy who [wrote annual Presidential Executive Orders declaring a continued State of National Emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_United_States) that brought us the NSA cell phone bullshit, along with all the other erosions of our privacy we are now totally accustomed to, and largely gave us the rise of Mass Surveillance? Turns out, ol' Barry had some pretty colorful characters working for him. One of those characters was this total badass named [Avril Haines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Haines)\n\nIf you don\u2019t know about her, [you should.](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/939722113/the-winding-journey-of-avril-haines-bidens-pick-to-lead-u-s-intelligence) Again, because she\u2019s a badass. Studied Judo in Japan, apparently became bored with that at some point and casually studied theoretical physics at University of Chicago. Somehow that wasn\u2019t exciting enough for her, so in her down time, she ended up buying a used-up, junk-ass Cessna airplane, and rebuilt the avionics herself. Once that little weekend project was completed, she tried to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and crash-landed near the Newfoundland coast. No shit. I mean, who does that?! A badass judo hobbyist who dabbles in theoretical physics, that\u2019s who. Now, she did crash, yes, but: her co-pilot ended up falling in love and wife\u2019in the shit out of her. I mean, can you blame the guy? They cuddled for awhile and opened up a little bookstore in the ghetto of Baltimore, hoping the danger of a drug riddled city could hold her lust for excitement and adventure. Shocker: it couldn\u2019t.\n\nBy the early 2000\u2019s, she was bouncing around government jobs doing lawyer stuff, and that\u2019s when she met Joe Biden. Several high-profile positions followed, but the one I want to focus on happens in 2010, when she gets a seat at the table to be Deputy National Security advisor. Three years later? [She replaced Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy and former acting director.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cias-deputy-director-to-be-replaced-with-white-house-lawyer/2013/06/12/8fc2118e-d383-11e2-8cbe-1bcbee06f8f8_story.html)\n\nThat\u2019s right, you heard me. The CIA.\n\nSpeaking of Joe Biden... guess who he just nominated to be the Director of National Security?. If you said Avril Haines, you get a good star.\n\u201cDaegoba; what the fuuuuck does this have to do with Palantir?\u201d Well... do any of you degenerates know who was the first investor in Palantir? [A little company called In-Q-Tel; the venture capital firm of the CIA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel) They kicked Thiel [a cool $2 million waaaaaay back in 2003, just as he got the company off the ground.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)\n\nNow, wouldn\u2019t it stand to reason that maybe, just maybe, it would be a safe bet to assume that the company who helped kill Osama bin Laden, with all these old friends getting together to run the US Government over the next few years, will see a little bit of success? You think!?\n\nIf this isn\u2019t your next big play over the long term, I don\u2019t know if you should full send your window licking hobby and surrender your RH account to your wife's boyfriend. Palantir will be a giant in the next two years at the very least, and a Juggernaut in Data Analytics long into the foreseeable future.\n\nNow, go. Invest in Palantir, and retire early. You\u2019re welcome.\n\n#GMEgang\n\n**HOLD THE LINE**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16\ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf16",

        "selftext": " \n\nWhat comes to mind when you think of BlackBerry? Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.\n\nTLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.\n\n**Software**\n\nBlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and QNX is apple car play compatible already.\n\n \n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nBlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)\n\n[https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe](https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe) I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.\n\n \n\nOther big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and Tutes sold alot.\n\nThe **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.\n\n[https://gyazo.com/867fd62c67d9dfc59d832e94ca51ddbd](https://gyazo.com/867fd62c67d9dfc59d832e94ca51ddbd)  (Orange=200day)(Blue=50day)\n\n \n\nMorningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))\n\nThey also have **more cash** **than Debt**.\n\nBlackberries Future is looking good.\n\n3/19 12c\n\nFuck you retarded bot.",

        "selftext": "I am not a financial Advisor, and I\u2019m not your Papa. Do your own due diligence!\n\n# Thesis\n\nWe are knee deep in this quarantine, and solid quarantine plays that aren\u2019t already coming off of huge momentum, are hard to come by. But I believe this could be an exception. Every stay-at-home dot com online ecommerce platform has been sky-rocketed and flowers.com (1800flowers.com) at first glance seems no different. Trading at about $26 with ATH at $32 in August. But, I believe the market may not have factored in just how much flowers.com is benefitting.\n\nFirst and foremost this was brought to my attention at work. I\u2019m a courier(for one of the major shippers), and I check every package that comes through there. Over the past couple months, I\u2019ve been watching as flowers.com packages have been noticeably growing in volume. The hypothesis is simple:\n\nAt a time when you are not able to see friends and loved ones flowers and gift boxes are a way to convey, I love you, I miss you, Thinking of you, Sorry for your loss, Get better soon, Congratulations, Happy Anniversary, and Condolences, while we have the inability to do so in person. What do you get grandma in the nursing home, who doesn\u2019t need anything, or the relative who\u2019s got everything? Or an office that worked through quarantine?\n\nIt\u2019s as pure as it comes too. Flowers.com has pretty much dominated and monopolized the market for online flowers and gift boxes with the acquisition of competitors. Recently expanding with another HCT Mention BBBY, acquiring personalizationmall.com, that allows pretty much any gift/wedding/keepsake to be personalized(although there is some ongoing issues with this acquisition due to pandemic).\n\nThey also purchased Sheri\u2019s Berries, [www.berries.com/](http://www.berries.com/) a chocolate dipped fruit gift company. The list goes on and on, with baskets.com, simplychocolate.com, fruitbouquets.com, cheryls.com(cookies), thepopcornfactory.com, a premium meats service\u2026 baked goods\u2026 enough said. But out of all of those, the big kicker for me is Harry and David\u2019s(\\*\\*which I would love to get web traffic for too\\*\\*), which is a gourmet gift box. I saw a noticeable amount of Harry and David packages going out to homes and business over the last four weeks of holidays, almost matching volume with flowers.com.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6k3hoblsg2b61.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1360ca9f02cd427a80e11f84b42e5774114debbd\n\nEarly on, I couldn\u2019t find the g trends to support my growing hypothesis, but now that seems to have shifted and the data has had time to mature, I believe flowers.com is seeing a huge spike in sales growth.\n\n[It may be hard to tell but searches yoy for all trends is up.  ](https://preview.redd.it/u9c9xltvg2b61.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8213167d74e443e0042f2bda38ab4e4bf4d61070)\n\n[Web traffic is up. The spikes are yearly occurrences, but are up yoy, and the overall upward momentum is positive. Conclusion](https://preview.redd.it/nm8em0l2h2b61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3dc9a265b13619b6a77f72747e1a669b1e2f247)\n\n[A clear depiction of market dominance.

Last earnings was a beat, and some of this growth has been factored into upcoming earnings, no doubt about that. But as with any social arb trade, one of the questions is: Is the market fully appreciating the trend?\n\nI don\u2019t believe it has, and I believe there is room to run up and past ATH\u2019s. With a very good outlook for an upcoming earnings beat, this seems like a pure play with solid gains potential and little downside risk.\n\nUpcoming earnings are scheduled for the end of January and Flowers.com and its subsidiaries have a clear market dominance to capitalize on a holiday season in quarantine.\n\n# Trades made\n\nIt\u2019s a cyclical play and I\u2019m in through earnings with around 3-4% of portfolio in equity, which I will build on any further dips to 8% of total portfolio.\n\nI will add in calls on any down day through earnings in the same manner.\n\nJust gut-based speculation here, but I believe it could pull back to the median range of 24-25$ before hitting an upswing, if so I will be aggressively building out my position.\n\nThere is also a solid argument to be made that this could be a solid long-term play as well with continuous growth over the next 3-5 years.\n\n# Research\n\n[https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2020/1-800-flowers-buys-bed-bath-beyond-personalization-mall/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2020/1-800-flowers-buys-bed-bath-beyond-personalization-mall/) (aquisition of BBBY division, Personalizationmall.com)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bed-bath-1800-flowers-com-lawsuit-idUSKBN21K3B8](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bed-bath-1800-flowers-com-lawsuit-idUSKBN21K3B8) (a lawsuit over personalizationmall.com just for balance)\n\n# Credit\n\nSpecial thanks to **TraderJohsaphat**,  Neppah Ti Tel, Cam10 and DanN, tillatron14, DM cmt. for dd/additional support.",

        "selftext": " Good day fellow SPAC investors. I am back with another company trading close to Nav that I think has immense potential to find the next Palantir. I am hoping to generate some discussion around this and get others thoughts on this company. As always, I am by no means an expert, so do your own due diligence.\n\n**NSH - NavSight Holdings, Inc. - 10.21**\n\n**Why I invested:** The leadership of this SPAC is dominated by multiple people who have spent their careers working in national security as well as providing differentiated expertise and technology to U.S. government customers in support of their national security, intelligence, and defense missions.They have worked at top government agencies in this area including the NSA, have grown businesses in the space and have invested in many others. In doing this, they obviously have developed an extensive network of contacts and relationships which will provide substantial sources of acquisition opportunities. They should have a lot of insight into finding an ideal SPAC that will hopefully be successful and provide a great return to investors. For me, this is a company that could invest in the next Palantir and I am hopeful that it will be something that I can hold long after the merger.

        "selftext": " I don't get what you guys are worried about with PLTR.\n\nHere's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.\n\nFears preventing you from buying PLTR\n\n1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven\n2. Shills spamming \"pLtR tO tHe MoOn\" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.\n3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.\n4. Financials Moving Forwards\n5. Soros who owns 21 million shares \"threatening\" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.\n6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.\n7. What does PLTR tldr.\n8. Other Information\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#1 Targeted Ads***\n\nAds and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.\n\nAds are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.\n\nTo me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**\n\nAdditionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#2 Shilling PLTR***\n\nI myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.\n\nShillery is OK, but at least give the facts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***\n\nIf you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's \"bad\" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.\n\n**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n&gt;We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nI would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.\n\n*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.\n\n* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \\~260 million.***\n* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \\~987 million.***\n\nADDITIONALLY...\n\nPLTR also had a higher R&amp;D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&amp;D, but somehow ended up paying \\~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n&gt;On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***\n\nPLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.\n\nHere's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:\n\n1. CDC\n2. Office of the Secretary\n3. Food and Drug Administration\n4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE\n5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS\n6. National Institute on Drug Abuse\n7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground\n8. Coast Guard / DHS\n9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command\n10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ\n11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS\n\nBoys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.\n\n***UPCOMING EARNINGS***\n\nI've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.\n\n***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nNow, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.\n\nI've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&amp;D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.\n\n***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nSome people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)\n\nIn my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.\n\nThere is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.\n\n***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***\n\nShort answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.\n\n*Processing img ba58nqcurob61...*\n\nPalantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.\n\nMithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.\n\nProspectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\nI suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.\n\n**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***\n\nFirst of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.\n\nIf you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.\n\nWhether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.\n\nNothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.\n\nPLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***\n\nTo my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:\n\n* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.\n* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.\n\nThere's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \\~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.\n\nWhen those shares are \"unlocked\" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.\n\n&gt;According to [Palantir\u2019s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.\n\nWhat **WILL** affect stock price:\n\n* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.\n* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.\n\n*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*\n\nWhat **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:\n\n* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.\n* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)\n* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.\n* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.\n* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***\n\nImagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone &amp; Youtube's Database of everything &amp; Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.\n\nPalantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.\n\nIt's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.\n\nLiterally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.\n\nWhile this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.\n\ntldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.\n\n**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**\n\nGovernments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.\n\nGovernments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.\n\n**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.\n\nPLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#8 Other Information***\n\n***\\*\\*Big known PLTR Holders\\*\\****\n\n*Processing img a404oalxrob61...*\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR's Price List (2019)\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186](https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Personal TA and Crayon Mania\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR stock pumping events\\*\\****\n\n* 7'th Jan - Interview\n* 26'th Jan - Demonstration\n* 11'th Feb - Earnings\n* \\~15'th Feb - DPO expiration - Havoc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Similar Companies\\*\\****\n\n* PLTR - Palantir - Stock Price \\~$25 - Market Cap 48bln\n* AYX - Alteryx - Stock Price \\~$125 - Market Cap 8bln\n* Semantic Research - Private\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Known Contract Info\\*\\****\n\n* 240 million Palantir Air Force contract expiring soon in 3 months.

I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.\n\nAlso yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.\n\nI've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.\n\nI come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.\n\nMy PT's for PLTR are:\n\n* 48-89 by March or April.\n* 75 - 125 by EOY.\n* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&amp;D cost issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0k1ujprob61.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b3a16265edafa290432e6b79f9009e3df99f495",

The employee lockout is coming on Jan 26th, and it will be a buying opportunity, because Palantir\u2019s is \ud83d\ude80going \ud83d\ude80to \ud83d\ude80the \ud83c\udf46fuckin\u2019 \ud83c\udf16moon, boys. Get your helmets on, and strap in. This \ud83d\ude80rocket\u2019s about to blast off.\n\nPalantir\u2019s pretty well-established in the Data Analytics community with Big Government contracts pouring money into it's R&amp;D projects. You don\u2019t need to turn a profit when the Government uses you for their skunkworks dept. Especially this early on the explosion of industry that is Surveillance.\n\nSpeaking of surveillance... let\u2019s take a little walk down memory lane, shall we. Y\u2019all remember Barack Obama, right? Tan suit? Dijon mustard? The guy who [wrote annual Presidential Executive Orders declaring a continued State of National Emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_United_States) that brought us the NSA cell phone bullshit, along with all the other erosions of our privacy we are now totally accustomed to, and largely gave us the rise of Mass Surveillance? Turns out, ol' Barry had some pretty colorful characters working for him. One of those characters was this total badass named [Avril Haines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Haines)\n\nIf you don\u2019t know about her, [you should.](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/939722113/the-winding-journey-of-avril-haines-bidens-pick-to-lead-u-s-intelligence) Again, because she\u2019s a badass. Studied Judo in Japan, apparently became bored with that at some point and casually studied theoretical physics at University of Chicago. Somehow that wasn\u2019t exciting enough for her, so in her down time, she ended up buying a used-up, junk-ass Cessna airplane, and rebuilt the avionics herself. Once that little weekend project was completed, she tried to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and crash-landed near the Newfoundland coast. No shit. I mean, who does that?! A badass judo hobbyist who dabbles in theoretical physics, that\u2019s who. Now, she did crash, yes, but: her co-pilot ended up falling in love and wife\u2019in the shit out of her. I mean, can you blame the guy? They cuddled for awhile and opened up a little bookstore in the ghetto of Baltimore, hoping the danger of a drug riddled city could hold her lust for excitement and adventure. Shocker: it couldn\u2019t.\n\nBy the early 2000\u2019s, she was bouncing around government jobs doing lawyer stuff, and that\u2019s when she met Joe Biden. Several high-profile positions followed, but the one I want to focus on happens in 2010, when she gets a seat at the table to be Deputy National Security advisor. Three years later? [She replaced Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy and former acting director.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cias-deputy-director-to-be-replaced-with-white-house-lawyer/2013/06/12/8fc2118e-d383-11e2-8cbe-1bcbee06f8f8_story.html)\n\nThat\u2019s right, you heard me. The CIA.\n\nSpeaking of Joe Biden... guess who he just nominated to be the Director of National Security?. If you said Avril Haines, you get a good star.\n\u201cDaegoba; what the fuuuuck does this have to do with Palantir?\u201d Well... do any of you degenerates know who was the first investor in Palantir? [A little company called In-Q-Tel; the venture capital firm of the CIA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel) They kicked Thiel [a cool $2 million waaaaaay back in 2003, just as he got the company off the ground.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)\n\nNow, wouldn\u2019t it stand to reason that maybe, just maybe, it would be a safe bet to assume that the company who helped kill Osama bin Laden, with all these old friends getting together to run the US Government over the next few years, will see a little bit of success? You think!?\n\nIf this isn\u2019t your next big play over the long term, I don\u2019t know if you should full send your window licking hobby and surrender your RH account to your wife's boyfriend. Palantir will be a giant in the next two years at the very least, and a Juggernaut in Data Analytics long into the foreseeable future.\n\nNow, go. Invest in Palantir, and retire early. You\u2019re welcome.\n\n#GMEgang\n\n**HOLD THE LINE**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16\ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf16",

        "selftext": " \n\nWhat comes to mind when you think of BlackBerry? Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.\n\nTLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.\n\n**Software**\n\nBlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and QNX is apple car play compatible already.\n\n \n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nBlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)\n\n[https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe](https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe) I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.\n\n \n\nOther big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and Tutes sold alot.\n\nThe **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.\n\n[https://gyazo.com/867fd62c67d9dfc59d832e94ca51ddbd](https://gyazo.com/867fd62c67d9dfc59d832e94ca51ddbd)  (Orange=200day)(Blue=50day)\n\n \n\nMorningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))\n\nThey also have **more cash** **than Debt**.\n\nBlackberries Future is looking good.\n\n3/19 12c\n\nFuck you retarded bot.",

        "selftext": "I am not a financial Advisor, and I\u2019m not your Papa. Do your own due diligence!\n\n# Thesis\n\nWe are knee deep in this quarantine, and solid quarantine plays that aren\u2019t already coming off of huge momentum, are hard to come by. But I believe this could be an exception. Every stay-at-home dot com online ecommerce platform has been sky-rocketed and flowers.com (1800flowers.com) at first glance seems no different. Trading at about $26 with ATH at $32 in August. But, I believe the market may not have factored in just how much flowers.com is benefitting.\n\nFirst and foremost this was brought to my attention at work. I\u2019m a courier(for one of the major shippers), and I check every package that comes through there. Over the past couple months, I\u2019ve been watching as flowers.com packages have been noticeably growing in volume. The hypothesis is simple:\n\nAt a time when you are not able to see friends and loved ones flowers and gift boxes are a way to convey, I love you, I miss you, Thinking of you, Sorry for your loss, Get better soon, Congratulations, Happy Anniversary, and Condolences, while we have the inability to do so in person. What do you get grandma in the nursing home, who doesn\u2019t need anything, or the relative who\u2019s got everything? Or an office that worked through quarantine?\n\nIt\u2019s as pure as it comes too. Flowers.com has pretty much dominated and monopolized the market for online flowers and gift boxes with the acquisition of competitors. Recently expanding with another HCT Mention BBBY, acquiring personalizationmall.com, that allows pretty much any gift/wedding/keepsake to be personalized(although there is some ongoing issues with this acquisition due to pandemic).\n\nThey also purchased Sheri\u2019s Berries, [www.berries.com/](http://www.berries.com/) a chocolate dipped fruit gift company. The list goes on and on, with baskets.com, simplychocolate.com, fruitbouquets.com, cheryls.com(cookies), thepopcornfactory.com, a premium meats service\u2026 baked goods\u2026 enough said. But out of all of those, the big kicker for me is Harry and David\u2019s(\\*\\*which I would love to get web traffic for too\\*\\*), which is a gourmet gift box. I saw a noticeable amount of Harry and David packages going out to homes and business over the last four weeks of holidays, almost matching volume with flowers.com.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6k3hoblsg2b61.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1360ca9f02cd427a80e11f84b42e5774114debbd\n\nEarly on, I couldn\u2019t find the g trends to support my growing hypothesis, but now that seems to have shifted and the data has had time to mature, I believe flowers.com is seeing a huge spike in sales growth.\n\n[It may be hard to tell but searches yoy for all trends is up.  ](https://preview.redd.it/u9c9xltvg2b61.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8213167d74e443e0042f2bda38ab4e4bf4d61070)\n\n[Web traffic is up. The spikes are yearly occurrences, but are up yoy, and the overall upward momentum is positive. Conclusion](https://preview.redd.it/nm8em0l2h2b61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3dc9a265b13619b6a77f72747e1a669b1e2f247)\n\n[A clear depiction of market dominance.

Last earnings was a beat, and some of this growth has been factored into upcoming earnings, no doubt about that. But as with any social arb trade, one of the questions is: Is the market fully appreciating the trend?\n\nI don\u2019t believe it has, and I believe there is room to run up and past ATH\u2019s. With a very good outlook for an upcoming earnings beat, this seems like a pure play with solid gains potential and little downside risk.\n\nUpcoming earnings are scheduled for the end of January and Flowers.com and its subsidiaries have a clear market dominance to capitalize on a holiday season in quarantine.\n\n# Trades made\n\nIt\u2019s a cyclical play and I\u2019m in through earnings with around 3-4% of portfolio in equity, which I will build on any further dips to 8% of total portfolio.\n\nI will add in calls on any down day through earnings in the same manner.\n\nJust gut-based speculation here, but I believe it could pull back to the median range of 24-25$ before hitting an upswing, if so I will be aggressively building out my position.\n\nThere is also a solid argument to be made that this could be a solid long-term play as well with continuous growth over the next 3-5 years.\n\n# Research\n\n[https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2020/1-800-flowers-buys-bed-bath-beyond-personalization-mall/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2020/1-800-flowers-buys-bed-bath-beyond-personalization-mall/) (aquisition of BBBY division, Personalizationmall.com)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bed-bath-1800-flowers-com-lawsuit-idUSKBN21K3B8](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bed-bath-1800-flowers-com-lawsuit-idUSKBN21K3B8) (a lawsuit over personalizationmall.com just for balance)\n\n# Credit\n\nSpecial thanks to **TraderJohsaphat**,  Neppah Ti Tel, Cam10 and DanN, tillatron14, DM cmt. for dd/additional support.",

As always, I am by no means an expert, so do your own due diligence.\n\n**NSH - NavSight Holdings, Inc. - 10.21**\n\n**Why I invested:** The leadership of this SPAC is dominated by multiple people who have spent their careers working in national security as well as providing differentiated expertise and technology to U.S. government customers in support of their national security, intelligence, and defense missions.They have worked at top government agencies in this area including the NSA, have grown businesses in the space and have invested in many others. In doing this, they obviously have developed an extensive network of contacts and relationships which will provide substantial sources of acquisition opportunities. They should have a lot of insight into finding an ideal SPAC that will hopefully be successful and provide a great return to investors. For me, this is a company that could invest in the next Palantir and I am hopeful that it will be something that I can hold long after the merger. My guess is that this will be in the cybersecurity space based on the leadership\u2019s past experience.

        "selftext": "People accuse MF of pump and dump schemes, claiming that if they really were successful investors they would be keeping their information to themselves.   \n\n\n1.  If you're invested in a company for the long term, sharing your DD makes it MORE LIKELY for your company to succeed. You get more people to invest in the company you own, the company gets more money to improve their bottom line, (marketing, hiring more engineers, obtaining more money for R&amp;D etc...).  Which then encourages more people to invest in them.  \n\n2. MF has been operating for the past \\~30 years. If they really were operating a pump and dump scheme, they would've been ousted long ago.  \n\n3. One of the MF founders interviewed Jack Bogle. During a segment they discussed that the more often you trade or sell stocks, the more likely you are to underperform the market. And they also found that if Warren Buffet never sold a single stock he would've been much wealthier today. Similarly MF found that if they never sold a single stock that they purchased, they also would've performed better. So they stopped adding when to sell stocks on their news letters. \n\nThat's why long term investors like ARK and Motley Fool SHARE all of their research and purchases. When they do that, more people invest in their companies, those companies then have a better chance of getting an early advantage compared to their competitors, and so on.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not subscribed to Motley Fool, but my dad has for the past 2 years and his portfolio consists entirely of MF stocks. He bought SHOP and FSLY before they were 1/10 the value they are now.

It's not much, like 1,5\u20ac/month, but still I don't want to \"waste\" money. So I searched for alternatives and found one but I don't really know if its worth it. I invest 150\u20ac/month into this ETF so the 1,5\u20ac would be 1%.  \nMain differentes are:  \nOld (**IE00BJ0KDQ92**)--&gt; TER : 0,19% p.a.,  1%(1,5/150) + 0,2% ATC = 1,2%/order  \nNew (**LU0274208692**) --&gt; TER : 0,45% p.a., 0% + 0.11% ATC = 0.11%/order\n\nSo my question is, with all the transaction cost from moving from the old ETF to the new, is it worth?  \nThanks in advance.",
