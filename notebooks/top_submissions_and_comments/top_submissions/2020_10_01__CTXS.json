Amazon actually has better synergy between its a) streaming biz b) Amazon online biz by the way of cross-marketing between the streaming customers and buyers, on top of that the home automation market, and much more capital to play in the streaming biz vs. Netflix, and lastly  c) Netflix's production capabilities is very much replicable with enough capital.\n\n2) I believe Amazon is well positioned to dominate the streaming market with Twitch, yet it will have synergies between the Streaming biz, Gaming biz, and Online Retail biz. Amazon can potentially fight steam for the platform biz, and it is already incorporating advanced gamification into Twitch that I believe will ultimately integrate with its Online retail and Gaming Biz\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) AWS and thin clients,. desktop virtualization space.

        "selftext": " **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**\n\nStocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. \n\nThe three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities\u2019 third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&amp;P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.\n\nIt seems traders are expecting September\u2019s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.\n\nFor the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.\n\nThe labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks\u2019 report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September\u2019s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we\u2019ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The index ticked down to 55.4 in September from 56.0 in August, whereas consensus economists expected a rise to 56.5. \n* The Senate Commerce Committee voted to authorize subpoenas forcing testimony from Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (GOOG) setting up what could be a contentious hearing with the largest U.S. social-media companies in the midst of a national election.\n* As big U.S. commercial banks close their books on the third quarter, analysts expect them to report a 30% to 60% plunge in profits on the year-ago period due to the pandemic-induced recession and near-record low-interest rates.\n* The Mark Zuckerberg-led company said in a statement that the advertising restrictions would be in place between Oct. 27 and Nov. 3.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**\n\nStocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. \n\nThe three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities\u2019 third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&amp;P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.\n\nIt seems traders are expecting September\u2019s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.\n\nFor the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.\n\nThe labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks\u2019 report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September\u2019s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we\u2019ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The index ticked down to 55.4 in September from 56.0 in August, whereas consensus economists expected a rise to 56.5. \n* The Senate Commerce Committee voted to authorize subpoenas forcing testimony from Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerbeg, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (GOOG) setting up what could be a contentious hearing with the largest U.S. social-media companies in the midst of a national election.\n* As big U.S. commercial banks close their books on the third quarter, analysts expect them to report a 30% to 60% plunge in profits on the year-ago period due to the pandemic-induced recession and near record low interest rates.\n* The Mark Zuckerberg-led company said in a statement that the advertising restrictions would be in place between Oct. 27 and Nov. 3.

        "selftext": "I sold my NET stock few days ago with good profit (at around 57$, 87% up), and I have about 10K worth of WCLD. I was looking into all the holdings of WCLD, and I was surprised there is no akamai (check [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld)).\n\nI started digging and I came across this very good comparison of the major cloud companies:\n\n[https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/)\n\nas you can see, it seems akamai has like 55% of market share, while NET and FASTLY are around 1%. The blog was from July, but I don't think things have changed dramatically since then. \n\nFrom reading the blog, it seems to me for big companies, akam seems to be the first choice for the biggest websites (facebook, adobe, ibm, to mention few).\n\nThen I started looking into the valuations, and I found this article from today comparing Akamai and Fastly\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001)\n\nIt was very eye opening, specially, the following table below  (Revenue and operating income are Guidances for 2020)\n\n    Company | Revenue | Operating Income  | Mkt Cap | P/S  | P/E   |  P/E (forward)\n    ---------|----------|-----------------|---------| ---- | ------|-----------------\n    FSLY  | $295 M |$7 million| $14.5 B | 54.0 | N/A  | 1,110\n    AKAM  | $3,150 M |$961 million| $18.8 B | 6.1 | 35  | 20.3\n\nThere is another table shown the revenue growth, where FSLY obviously have better figure (62% Q2 revenue growth for FSLY vs 13% for Akam), but Akam is still doing better when you look into margins \n\nI know the cloud market is growing, and Akam will not be able to keep the 55% market share. But still, how come it is almost not discussed here?\n\nSo after this quick research, I am thinking of buying a good 4-6K worth of Akamai. Any reasons why I shouldn't do that?  \n\nPS: Fsly, even after the big drops today and yesterday, is still up around 350% YTD, on the other hand, AKAM is only 26% up (NET is around 250% up YTD)",

        "selftext": "After sneaky WSJ reported \"talks\" of AMD buying Xilinx, we saw roughly a 17% jump in XLNX and a 2% drop in AMD from pre-market to market-open on 10/9.  That jump caught every fucking investing blog and finance news website's attention and by noon:o'clock there were about 20+ articles parading around like this was the biggest news since the Trump got Covid.  Here is why this AMD acquisition will never happen:\n\n/AMD DEBT/\n\nAMD cannot afford it.  They don't have enough cash on hand to make a $30billion deal\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/amd-ceo-tries-to-banish-debt-ridden-deal-ghosts-with-xilinx-bid](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/amd-ceo-tries-to-banish-debt-ridden-deal-ghosts-with-xilinx-bid)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/Xilinx's Business Model/\n\nXilinx may simply be trying to get acquired and are leaking rumors to get the fire started. See what companies they work with and see the data for yourself here:\n\n[https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets\\_glance.php?code=XLNX](https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets_glance.php?code=XLNX) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/Xilinx Price Tag/\n\n$30billion offering is already out of AMD's reach (as you can see from the valuations from the articles above). If Xilinx is truly interested in selling their company, then will likely open their doors to other tech giants who will pay more and have a better handle on the sector.  These rumored \"talks\" drive up share value as you have already seen and, if they're smart, they won't sell to anyone... just take the overvaluation and strike up exclusive contracts with all the competing companies who try and buy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, neither company would even comment on it.  AMD has been aggressive with their business since the induction of their newest CEO.  IMO this was a leak from AMD to illicit conversations with XLNX, but XLNX is too smart to let a company like AMD to swoop them up, even if AMD is trying to play the \"Fuck IBM\" card to pander them into an ethical agreement - or - this was a strategic move by XLNX to start a bidding war over their already stable company because they hit a ceiling in their profit model.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho knows tho, it's all rumors anyways\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: IDK wtf I'm talking about, but I can say that neither does anyone else on this matter except for our beloved sneaky-ass AMD/XLNX execs \n\n//\n\nAMD $80c 10/16\n\nXLNX $120p 10/16\n\nAVT $27c 2/19",

        "selftext": "From: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-divestiture-idINKBN26T1TZ\n\n(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp is splitting itself into two public companies, capping a years-long effort by the world\u2019s first big computing firm to diversify away from its legacy businesses to focus on high-margin cloud computing.\n\nIBM will list its IT infrastructure services unit, which provides technical support for 4,600 clients in 115 countries and has a backlog of $60 billion, as a separate company with a new name by the end of 2021.\n\nThe new company will have 90,000 employees and its leadership structure will be decided in a few months, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters.\n\nIBM, which currently has more than 352,000 workers, said it expects to record nearly $5 billion in expenses related to the separation and operational changes.\n\nInvestors cheered the surprise move by Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, the key architect behind IBM\u2019s $34 billion acquisition of cloud company Red Hat last year, sending the company\u2019s shares up 7%.\n\n\u201cWe divested networking back in the \u201890s, we divested PCs back in the 2000s, we divested semiconductors about five years ago because all of them didn\u2019t necessarily play into the integrated value proposition,\u201d Krishna said on a call with analysts.\n\nBIG BLUE\u2019S NEW FOCUS\n\nIn a blog, Krishna called the move a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in the 109-year-old company\u2019s business model.\n\n\u201cIBM is essentially getting rid of a shrinking, low-margin operation given the cannibalizing impact of automation and cloud, masking stronger growth for the rest of the operation,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said.\n\nIBM, which has sought to make up for slowing software sales and seasonal demand for its mainframe servers, said it would now focus on open hybrid cloud and AI solutions that will account for more than half of its recurring revenues.\n\nKrishna, who replaced Ginni Rometty as CEO in April, said IBM\u2019s software and solutions portfolio would account for the majority of company revenue after the separation.\n\nThe company also said it expects third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion and an adjusted profit per share of $2.58, roughly in line with Street estimates.",

        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading October 9th\n   \nSolid Day\n \nIBM Soars, DPZ Crushed\n \n \nToday\u2019s market was just a good, old-fashioned day without any major moves in the indexes, no earth-shattering tweets or end of days prognostications.  I didn\u2019t have any power, cable or phone last night so besides not putting out my Daily Note or closing comment, I miss the big debate.  Judging by the reports I heard today, all I missed was the fly on Pence\u2019s head!  The DJIA was = 122.06 (.43%), NASDAQ +56.38 (.50%), S&amp;P 500 +27.38 (.80%), the Russell was the big winner again +17.51 (1.09%) and the Transports +72.54 (.62%) and a new all-time high!  The internals were good with NYSE 3:1 and NASDAQ 2:1 positive and all I can say is that it was very a very \u201cGoldilocks\u201d kind of day.\n\nLooking at adding NEM and GLD calls, and a reentry into CVS and UNG calls probably...\n                                                                                                                           \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/lXD_OB9CrYU\n \nSECTORS:  There was good news for holders of Eaton Vance (EV) being taken over by Morgan Stanley (MS) for about $7 billion in cash and stock.  MS was -2.20 premarket but right after the open it started back up and finished $49.35 +.64, and since it included stock, the rise sent EV higher to close $60.78 +19.84 (48.4%).  \nIBM also had news that sent it higher.  They gave guidance and then announced that they are going to split the company up and make the pieces \u201cpure plays\u201d in an effort to get a better valuation for the parts.  It looked great pre-market but by the open it had given up about 1/3 of the gains and finished the day up $7.42 (6%) after the early market up 12%.  Same situation with REGN, trading up to $618 or so +$26, but the stock never made it there when the real market opened\u2026and then traded back to $598 and closed $599.70 +8.00, near the lows, but still ahead 1.24%.\nOn the downside, the DISASTER DU JOUR, was a name that I wrote about last week, WWR, Westwater Resources, which went from $1.52 to $14.50 on news that Mr. Trump had signed an executive order relating to securing \u201crare earth\u201d and critical minerals last week.

There were several \u201cunusual options action\u201d looking for another 10-12% on the upside before year end.  \n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $10,955 +235. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 Thursday, and after a day of rest in between, we resumed the rally touching $12,635, but have sold off back to support. We had 750 shares of GBTC and sold off 250 last week at $13.93 and still have 500 with a cost of $8.45. GBTC closed $11.86 +.89 today.\n \n Tomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "\\#**WHY #AMD #IS #GOING #TO #THE  #MOON**  \n\n\n\\#1\n\n**Heavily Rumoured New CPUs (including 16 core gaming CPU).**\n\nThis would be revolutionary and will put investors into a complete frenzy. The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

        "selftext": "I'm analyzing AMZN stock. I feel it has a lot of upside potentital given its AWS cloud offering which is top notch IaaS provider out there. They are innovating quite a bit in this space. \n\n* Building own processors (Annapurna labs) which can eat into intel, AMD lunch \n* Big IaaS leverage if they decide to venture into enterprise software space\n\nEcommerce is growing at a record space due to covid. \n\nAds is also promising line of business. I'm planning to a share per month for atleast 4 years for dollar cost averaging reasons. \n\nAnyone see downsides to this approach or AMZN for longterm",
