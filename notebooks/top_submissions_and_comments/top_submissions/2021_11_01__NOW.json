        "selftext": "The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  \n\nWhilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).\n\nTesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq\n\nIn China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.\n\nTesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.\n\nWhilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).\n\nWith Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.\n\nTesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.\n\n(These figures all verifiable with CleanTechnica and InsideEVs)",

        "selftext": "Mind you Walmart is at 400b market cap. So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... \n\nI've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... \n\nIf Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . \n\nLook I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. \n\nThe question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? \n\nAnother note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys I wanted to share my story in hopes that some of you defend will learn from my mistakes. Also for those of you who are experiencing something similar, I want you to know you can make it. So without further ado, here is my story (proof).\n\nhttps://ibb.co/3r1pNVX\n\nFor every gains porn post someone out there is on the other end with a loss. I can still remember when the GME runup began. I was so sure it would blow over in a day, and I picked up 10k in 3 month out puts just as GME crested 40 dollars. I remember as it skyrocketed I even found myself up on my position as the I/V grew. But I wanted more and I was so sure it would be back to 4 dollars in a month or two. Lesson one, don't get too smart, and don't fight the market.\n\nWell, a few months rolled by and the expiration on my options was getting close, they had slashed in value down to a third and even though GME had fallen, they weren't worth what I paid for them. I could have cut my losses and been out about 5k. But this is where I made my second mistake. Trading options on emotion. I couldn't believe my puts were priced correctly so I rolled them out a few more months, and aggressively. My position was now 50k instead of 10k. I couldn't let go of my ego and take the loss.\n\nWell, as fate would have it, a few days later GME would rip back up into the 200s. My freshly rolled position, started collapsing, and fast. I remember sitting at work every day, constantly pulling out my phone and staring at the GME ticker, waiting for any drop, hoping to be saved. But, my salvation never came, and my position got worse and worse. Enter my third mistake, doubling down. At this point I was desperate. I wanted, needed, to make my money back, so I averaged down, and averaged down again. My position was now worth just over 100k.\n\nWith each passing day, my position ticked down in value. I remember one day so vividly as I saw my losses pile up into the 80k range I noticed sharp pain in my chest. It had been getting harder and harder every day, and the extreme stress was taking a toll on my body. I held on for a few more days, but the pain was getting worse, and I was literally shaking (tm), from the stress. Finally I called it. I closed my position down a total of just over 100k. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. \n\nAs pathetic as this sounds, I remember actually crying several times thinking about what an idiot I was. When you lose that kind of money, and for me this wasn't play money, it takes you to a dark place. I remember ringing in my head over and over, what was I thinking, how could I make such a mistake. It was one of my lowest points ever, and it felt like I would never feel normal again, anyone who has been in my shoes knows what I'm talking about.\n\nWell, it's been 7 months sense then and I will never touch an option again. I know now that I have a gambling problem and I can't put myself in that kind of position. It has been hard, to come to terms with losing something I spent many years of my life building, but I have made it through. To anyone who is where I was, right now, I know how it feels, and I promise you the age old adage, time heals all wounds is true, it does get easier.\n\nAnyway, thanks to anyone who read all the way through, I hope I can somebody out there learns from my mistakes, or at the very least cracks a smile laughing at my misfortune. I wouldn't be who I am now without my experience, so cheers you beautiful bastards.",

We are the one that sells shit to ur the distributors, the distributors sells to stores. We are also the one directly sells on Amazon and other e-commerce website. \n\nPre COVID, a 40ft high cube costs me only $4000 from China to Long Beach. Currently it costs me god damn $20000, and that doesn\u2019t include land transport. If I want to sent a container of goods to Ohio, the total cost on shipping alone is like $40000, excluding import duties. Back in the day shipping make up abt 30% of my cost, it makes up 60-70% now. Pre COVID a container of nice double layer fleece lining hoodies cost me 60 includes shipping. It costs me 100k this year. \n\nThere are 110 some container ships stuck outside of Long Beach. You probably have no idea how many that is..ima use the nice fleece lining hoodies as example again. Each 40ft high cube carry\u2019s 6000 this hoodie (so 20ft carry abt 3000). Each ship carry 20000 TEU (20ft equivalent units. there are also some 2 million 20ft equivalent units (TEU) still in the port waiting to be hauled.. \n3000*20000=60 million hoodies \n110*20000=2.2million containers on ship stuck outside still. \n2.2million+2million=4.2 millions on containers total. \n4200000*60000000=252000000000000\n\nUS population is 333000000 \nThat\u2019s 756 thousand hoodies for each personjust stuck there to be distributed! \n\nLet\u2019s say my number is off by 50%, it\u2019s still 378 thousands hoodies just stuck there! \n\nWe can\u2019t unload at Houston or New York cuz it will cost us even more\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s not the demand, it\u2019s the problem of supply. \n\nIt\u2019s not that there are too many monies were printed, who cares if we print more money, we can print unlimited useless pieces of paper and buy real goods from China ( export our Inflation)!\n\nSo, if u see on the news that the supply chain has been fixed, or the port of Long Beach has been cleared, or you know inflation is about to stapled.. until that , whatever the fed say is bs.\n\nSide note Biden should declare national emergency and have nat guard come in and help haul these sticker goods.",

The package includes a $65 billion investment in improving the nation's broadband infrastructure, and invests tens of billions of dollars in improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion would go to building a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers, according to the bill text.\nBiden called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just before midnight to congratulate her on the passage of the infrastructure bill, a source familiar with the call tells CNN.

My gut feeling tells me that if everyone flocks to one thing, there must be something fishy about it all.\n\nI can't lie, I've been tempted time and time again to jump in, seeing my friends make 10% in a single day and what not. I guess I am only human. However, after reading the works of Buffet, Howard Marks, Munger, and those gentlemen (which i consider my teachers), Tesla just seems to go against their philosophy; especially when it comes to the margin of safety principle. \n\nNow Tesla is a special case, if we look at Tesla as a company, their dept is consistently decreasing, equity and profits are growing like crazy, all of that is good. It's just the valuation. Currently at a P/E of \\~300 for instance, it means they have A LOT to back up for in the near future and the public obviously has high hopes in them. But my question is, what exactly is this hope? I am not very informed about Tesla, neither am I an engineer, which is why I wanna hear some of your opinions about them. \n\n\\- What is their specific moat when it comes to the electric cars? How will this moat be protected by other automobile dealers? (i.e the Germans, Ford, the Chinese, etc...) Is it just their brand or do they have superior technology that will actually be hard to replicate/improve by other companies in the coming 10 years? \n\n\\- What other ventures are they going into besides cars? Is it A.I? What constitutes as A.I? If it is a personal robot who does the dishes for you and cleans your house, in what way will they have superior engineers compared to the other giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft? And why will they perform better than them?\n\nBasically, what is it that they do that makes people so confident about them, and what is it that accounts to this valuation?",

        "selftext": "First off screw fundamentals they absolutely cannot be considered when evaluating this stock. Last year I was trading this pre-boom. I remember everyone bickering about it not being able to go up anymore because it had just went up by 400%. On April 3rd 2020 GME hit 2.57, on sep 22nd it grew by 400% hitting $11.18 Alot of doubters said it couldn't go higher. On December 23rd it yet doubled what it had quadrupled hitting $22.40 Now everyone was convinced it couldn't go up further. On Jan 19th we saw it hit $45.6, Now of coarse it can't possibly go up any further. WRONG again, From here we saw it go up to $159 on Jan 25 and still it continued until it finally hit 483 on Jan 28th. Everybody thought it was going to go back trading below $20 but here we are 11 months later, and it has broken out of a long penant I bet it at least Doubles its all time high! Plus we are seeing daily increases in volume yet volume is lower still than in august but we are above the august bump levels. Huge indicator that we are dealing with a full fledged blue pill RAGER.

        "selftext": "Hello all, I have a family member who is approaching his 40\u2019s and he is hell-bent on throwing every dollar he has into Ethereum. He is one of those people who drinks too much, is too loud, and is generally terrible with money. I intern in the financial industry, in actual trading, but he just seems to ignore me completely. \n\nHe has this idea that he missed out on getting rich through bitcoin, so he thinks buying Ethereum at all time highs is equivalent to buying bitcoin at 4K. He\u2019s not understanding that price means nothing and market cap is a more relevant indicator of your timing. Ethereum already has an enormous market cap and the upside is limited. He is also one of those who don\u2019t understand that there is no thing as getting rich quick. I\u2019ve tried telling him about just holding a diversified portfolio and making monthly/yearly contributions but of course it falls on deaf ears.\n\nI\u2019m worried that if/when we see another 50% drop overnight, he\u2019s going to be wiped out. He has kids who will feel it too.  And i get it, a lot of Americans are feeling insecure about retirement and they feel like they must make last ditch efforts to make up for years of poor finances. But this is reality, I know for certain that this guy is going to get burned chasing the next big thing. He got lucky and bought GME, which he then blew the proceeds on luxury rentals and alcohol. Now I think he\u2019a chasing that high again.\n\nHow do I not feel responsible? How do I wake him up? Should I not care?",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/zillow-shares-plunge-after-announcing-it-will-close-home-buying-business.html\n\n&gt;Zillow, the digital real estate company, said on Tuesday that it\u2019s exiting Offers, its business that buys and flips homes, and eliminating 25% of its workforce.\n\n&gt;The announcement was attached to Zillow\u2019s third-quarter earnings report. The company\u2019s revenue and earnings missed analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated,\u201d Zillow CEO Rich Barton said in the release. \u201cContinuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility.\u201d\n\n&gt;The stock dropped about 7.5% in extended trading following a 10% plunge during regular market hours. The shares are now down about 10% for the year as of Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\n&gt;Here are the key numbers from earnings:\n\n&gt;Earnings per share: loss of 95 cents adjusted vs. profit of 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts\nRevenue: $1.74 billion vs. $2.01 billion expected by Refinitiv\nRevenue in Zillow\u2019s Offers business, which competes with Opendoor, climbed to $1.17 billion in the quarter. That\u2019s way up from $186 million a year earlier, which was in the middle of the pandemic and in a dry period for transactions. However, the homes segment, which is mostly Offers, lost $422 million in the quarter, producing an overall net loss at the company.\n\n&gt;Shares of Opendoor rose 7% in extended trading. The stock plunged alongside Zillow earlier in the day, dropping 15% at the close.\n\n&gt;Zillow launched Offers in December 2019, starting with Southern California markets. The iBuying, or instant buying, product allowed homeowners to sell their home to Zillow for cash, eliminating a lengthy bidding, sales and closing process. They also didn\u2019t have to worry about costly repairs before putting their house on the market.\n\n&gt;\u201cAfter closing on a home, Zillow will take care of necessary repairs, working with local contractors to complete projects like a fresh coat of paint, servicing HVAC units and other work a typical homeowner would do to get their home ready for sale,\u201d Zillow said in a press release at the time.\n\n&gt;But the home-flipping market proved to be a drag for a company that had built its brand on listing homes across the country and helping buyers and sellers connect through a marketplace. Prior to shuttering the business, the company said on Monday that it would stop buying houses through the end of the year, citing tight labor and supply markets.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re operating within a labor- and supply-constrained economy inside a competitive real estate market, especially in the construction, renovation and closing spaces,\u201d said Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow\u2019s operating chief, in a statement this week. \u201cWe have not been exempt from these market and capacity issues and we now have an operational backlog for renovations and closings.\u201d\n\n&gt;Barton told CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d after the report that Zillow\u2019s ultimate failure was its inability to predict housing prices accurately. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the market dried up. It then bounced back dramatically, and prices in many markets have climbed to record levels.\n\n&gt;For the home-flipping business to be profitable, a company has to be able to sell a home for more than the purchase price and have enough margin remaining to cover all the other costs, such as maintenance and sales and marketing expenses. Barton said the company realized that it\u2019s not in a position to accurately predict where home prices will be in six months \u201cwithin a narrow margin of error.\u201d\n\n&gt;Additionally, Barton said the Offers product reaches only a small sliver of the company\u2019s overall audience, which is effectively the entire market of homebuyers and sellers across the country.\n\n&gt;Zillow\u2019s internet, media and technology business grew revenue 16% in the quarter to $480 million, with gross profit of just over $130 million.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe just determined that being an iBuyer was too risky, too volatile and ultimately addressed too few customers,\u201d Barton said. He added that, in closing the business, \u201cthe logic is clear, the emotion is difficult\u201d because of the layoffs.\n\n&gt;Bloomberg reported on Monday that Zillow was looking to sell 7,000 homes for $2.8 billion to institutional investors, as it looked to unload its portfolio of properties. Some of those sales would be for below the purchase price, Bloomberg said.\n\n&gt;Barton didn\u2019t confirm or deny the numbers in the Bloomberg report. He told CNBC that the company has always sold to those types of buyers since entering the market, and he acknowledged that Zillow does have properties that it needs to sell. The company bought 3,805 houses in the second quarter and sold 2,086 in that period.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re not in any kind of fire sale,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wind down the inventory in an orderly way.\u201d\n\nSeems like the strategy of buying 80 cents for the dollar just to capture market shares has finally backfired.",

        "selftext": "https://imgur.com/gallery/keCnGJU\n\nTL;DR: Tesla should probably be earning about 33x-100x as much as their most recent year-to-date earnings in order to justify the current valuation.\n\n\nI've been hearing about how overvalued Tesla is for over a year now, and I'm getting tired of it. So I decided to look into the financial data myself, and determine just how reasonable or ridiculous Tesla's current valuation is. \n\nTo get a baseline for what an auto manufacturer's legitmate value should be, I decided to look at historical data for the 5 largest automotive companies today. I chose to examine data from 2010-2015, as that is the most recent time period in which the overall market was within one standard deviation above or below \"fair value\" on the Buffett Indicator. I then recorded each company's Market Capitalization and Earnings at the end of each year. \n\nI'm an idiot, so I decided I'd divide Earnings by Market Cap to find a ratio to determine what Tesla's earnings *should* be given their current valuation. I came to realize later that this is essentially the P/E ratio, but inversed. If any fellow smoothies didn't know (like me), P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current share price of a stock by its EPS (earnings per share), however you can also calculate it by dividing the company's total Market cap by their total earnings, which I did the inverse of. Anyways, the math still functions the same for my intended purpose. \n\nI calculated that the largest auto manufacturers earned an average of 8%-28% of their valuations back when the market was most fairly valued, according to the Buffett Indicator. So, in order for Tesla to be fairly valued at $1.2 Trillion, they should be earning about $107 Billion to $343 Billion each year. In the past 5 years, Tesla earned an average of -0.83% of their market cap with their most recent earnings around $3 Billion.\n\nFor reference, the highest recorded earnings of any company in history was $114 Billion by the oil company Saudi Aramco in 2018. As another reference, Apple's highest ever yearly earnings was $61 Billion, also in 2018.  \n\nIf Tesla was a literal money printer that costs $1,200 and prints $3/year, it'd take 400 years to be profitable. Even if it ramps up the printing, it would still take ages. But hey, putting a car in space was kinda cool.\n\nSource: https://companiesmarketcap.com",

Made some gains in the past two weeks.  \n\n\nIt all started when I heard about the Gamestop fiasco. I pretty much started investing after the larger squeeze, so as you can imagine, I ended up bagholding and lost money. Now, after discovering options, I became slightly addicted and lost around 30k over the course of the year, transferring little by little from my bank account to RH. Pic related.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0c5d1ytnox71.png?width=1112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4a6f43a71df2d9ae0a3fd513487d2598bb963e6\n\nNow, I am down to my last 4.4k, what do I do with it? I gamble it on options of course! Little did I know, Hertz made an announcement to purchase Tesla vehicles. I just woke up to go to work and seen Tesla was rising. Here's the purchase and sells for that.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sydwpsu5qox71.png?width=2166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6978d7dbef473cf6bff7c69067c43d41e291276d\n\nShit man! I had some fucking money! I made all my losses back plus an extra 10k or so. I finally accomplished something in my life! Why would I want it to end there though? I want more. So much more.  \n\n\nNvidia and SPY have been doing great as well so I started to buy calls for those as well.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kca4cu5csox71.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=904f07848209847bb7dd0e936128a51e0f283064\n\nGolly gee! I'm high on a rush of gambling so I needed to continue. This put me at about 60k or so total. I took profit where I could and thats the way you should always play it.\n\nIt's not enough though. We gotta keep going don't we? It's NVIDIA time!  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8mtg5w0tox71.png?width=2171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8a66323c1bd2b8c4ba35dd6587a4c2c51809289\n\nIt is now November 3rd I have around 125000 in my RH account.

I made a shit ton of money. My dad didn't believe me. I didn't believe it. I'm glad I sold before the big dip today. Currently, my account is at:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vt6kuhzytox71.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc2f147fb51c55278958befa9b546fe2c7d34ab\n\nBut peaked at \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivatzc51uox71.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e870da631a359c63ec339e781dd2f527092c9c9c\n\nI am just blown away. If it wasn't for WSB, shitposting, losing money, I would never have made this achievement. Can't forgot JPow either. Thanks!  \n\n\np.s. My current positions remaining are 100 310c 11/5 (down 64k) and 13 300c 11/5 (put 200 order in but didnt fill) I also am still holding SPY 400 266c 11/5.  \nSo, in 14 days, I raised my account by 680,000 for a 17,250% gain since Oct 5.\n\nIn between all of these options I did place some which either made so little difference or even lost money but overall I felt it didn't matter to put them in. Yes I couldve held some of the earlier ones longer for a way bigger profit, but sometimes you gotta take what you got and work with it.",

I rode that one from $12 all the way up to the high of $28. During the second MVIS peak of June, I had almost made it back up to $300,000, it then dipped below $20 and never came back. I became married to that stock, I averaged down and just continued to diamond hand into oblivion. It crushed my account. I ended up selling at $11. If I were still holding now, my net worth would be below 6 figures.\n\n\nAfter selling MVIS at $11, my average cost had become $15 and I had around a 25% loss. This brought me to around $130k. I bought CLF before the most recent earnings and got a sweet 15% profit from that. Up to $150k. Then I bought TDOC before earnings at $140, but my stop loss triggered at $130 the day after earnings, before it rocketed up to $150 without me. Back to $130k.\n\n\nI became tantalizingly close to riches with DWAC. I watched the legendary SPAC pump go from $10 rapidly to $15 and beyond, I had a 50k buy order set to trigger at $20, but at the last second, I said \"nah this is dumb\", and I cancelled the order. Had I not cancelled it, and held to the peak, I would have over half a million today.\n\n\nMissing DWAC caused me to FOMO hard. Recently, Black Rifle Coffee went public with a SPAC, I assumed it would do the same as DWAC, you know... conservative pumpers and all that. Ended up losing $10k from that. Down to $120k. \n\n\nMost recently I went all in on BGFV, bought at $28 and averaged up to $32, watched myself recover to $150k yesterday before a brutal 30% dump. And earlier this morning I got out, because enough YOLOing is enough for me. That was my breaking point. And viola! Thats how I got down to $110k.\n\n\nFrom now on, its a diversified portfolio of large caps for me, no more big high risk yolos. \n\n\nMy advice:\nDon't get married to a stock, if you're in a clear downtrend, get out. A small loss is better than a big loss.\n\nSet stop losses to lock in your profits, but dont set them too tight during volatile periods such as right after earnings\n\nDon't FOMO into retarded stuff. \n\nDon't average down, average up. \n\nAssume a stock going up will continue to go up, and one going down will continue down, don't try to time tops and bottoms. \n\n\n[Snapshots of my money throughout 2021](https://i.imgflip.com/5t4zp0.jpg)",

        "selftext": "Beyond Meat on Wednesday reported a widening loss in its third quarter as U.S. demand for its meat substitutes shrank and higher costs ate into its profits.\n\nThe company also disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter outlook, indicating that sales aren\u2019t expected to snap back immediately. Shares of the company tumbled 18% in extended trading.\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\nLoss per share: 87 cents vs. 39 cents expected\nRevenue: $106.4 million vs. $109.2 million expected\nBeyond reported fiscal third-quarter net loss of $54.8 million, or 87 cents per share, wider than a net loss of $19.3 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected a loss of 39 cents per share.\n\nThe company said it faced higher transportation and warehousing costs and increased its inventory write-offs, which hurt its profits. About $9 million was written off due to water damage at one of its plants, which mostly affected packaging.\n\nWATCH NOW\nVIDEO02:03\nBeyond Meat to launch chicken in select grocery stores\nNet sales rose 12.7% to $106.4 million, missing expectations of $109.2 million. Compared with the second quarter, its revenue fell, bucking typical seasonal trends for the company\u2019s products. Customers usually buy more Beyond Burgers during the summer to grill.\n\nThe company reported strong growth outside the United States, with international grocery and restaurant divisions each seeing sales more than double during the quarter.\n\nHowever, U.S. revenue fell 13.9% compared with a year ago, mostly due to weaker grocery demand. CEO Ethan Brown told analysts that grocery sales didn\u2019t help make up for shrinking food service orders, unlike in 2020.\n\nThe company also said softer demand and operational challenges, like severe weather, hurt its domestic sales. Brown said new competitors in the market are putting pressure on its market share, but data doesn\u2019t reveal that the lower demand is due to other companies stealing its customers. New products, like its meatless chicken, slightly offset U.S. sales declines.\n\nIn October, the company warned investors that it would be reporting weaker sales than it had previously predicted, citing a wide range of factors, including the delta variant and distribution problems.\n\nAnd the company\u2019s forecast doesn\u2019t indicate a sunnier fourth quarter. Beyond is predicting net sales of $85 million to $110 million for those three months. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $131.6 million during the quarter.\n\nBeyond said it\u2019s expecting some of the operational challenges from the third quarter to drag down its fourth-quarter results as well. It also cited restaurants\u2019 labor challenges and hesitant ordering behavior due to uncertainty tied to the pandemic as other factors embedded in the outlook. The company noted that the period contains 5 fewer shipping days than a year prior.\n\n\u201cNear-term market and operating conditions notwithstanding, we remain committed to our long-term strategy,\u201d Brown said in a statement.\n\nHe told analysts he is feeling optimistic about 2022. He hinted at new product launches coming next year, saying that some of those items could reach price parity with meat.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/beyond-meat-bynd-q3-2021-earnings.html",

        "selftext": "Jerome Powell, who guided the Federal Reserve and the nation\u2019s economy through the staggering and sudden Covid-19 recession by implementing unprecedented monetary stimulus, has been nominated for a second term as chairman of the U.S. central bank.\n\nPresident Joe Biden made the announcement Monday morning following weeks of speculation that a push from progressives might see Fed Governor Lael Brainard get the spot.\n\nBrainard instead will be vice chair of the board of governors; she had been widely expected to get a separate vice chair for supervision post, which oversees the nation\u2019s banking system. As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we can\u2019t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I\u2019m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard\u2019s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.\n\nIn making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its \u201cdecisive\u201d action in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nThe Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank\u2019s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.\n\n\u201cChair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,\u201d a White House statement said. \u201cDuring that time, Lael Brainard \u2013 one of our country\u2019s leading macroeconomists \u2013 has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country\u2019s robust economic recovery.\u201d\n\nThough Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.\n\nThe Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated \u2013 in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.\n\nPowell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.\n\nThe inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.\n\nThe White House statement said the recovery is \u201ca testament to the success of the President\u2019s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America\u2019s economy back on track.\u201d\n\nBrainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.\n\nA former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.\n\nThe White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.\n\nBiden said that Powell and Brainard \u201calso share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cFundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve \u2013 and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,\u201d he added.\n\nPolitical pressure, and a Covid struggle\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.\n\nThough Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers \u201cboneheads\u201d for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.\n\nAs for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation\u2019s banking system.\n\nThe Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation\u2019s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.\n\nTo combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nEconomists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. \n\n\u201cUnder Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,\u201d Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.\n\n\u201cThis is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden\u2019s agenda.\u201d  \n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden\u2019s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief\u2019s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed\u2019s chair and is the country\u2019s first female Treasury secretary. \n\n\u201cI talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cI think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.\u201d \n\nPowell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. \n\nThe news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed\u2019s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a \u201cdangerous man\u201d and that she would oppose his renomination.",

That\u2019s *Polstj\u00e4rnan* (literal translation, \u201cPole Star\u201d) if you\u2019re Swedish.\n* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo\u2019s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.\n* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.\n* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being \u201cindependent since 2017.\u201d\n* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.\n\n**Comps**\n\n**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**\n\n* Applying Tesla\u2019s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.\n* Applying Lucid\u2019s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d\n\n**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**\n\n* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.\n* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:\n\n1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).\n2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.\n\n* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.\n* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.\n* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec\n\n**Gores' Deals**\n\nGores\u2019 track record speaks for itself\u2026\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae\n\n**The EV Graveyard**\n\nThe EV battlefield is littered with bodies.\n\nBut Polestar?\n\nThey've   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars.

[Here's](https://s27.q4cdn.com/416879924/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/ZIM-Q3-2021-investors-call-Final-17-11-2021.pdf) the link to their latest earnings. \\*spoiler: they absolutely crushed it\\*. I have literally looked at the top 12 largest, publicly-traded shipping companies and this one seems to have the greatest mismatch on price:value. \n\n**Margins**\n\n$ZIM has one of (if not, the) highest margins of any shipping company in the industry with a 66% EBITDA margin (that's double $APPL). \n\n**Rate of growth**\n\nWhether it has been their shipping fleet acquisitions, the freight prices, or efficient logistics $ZIM has 18X'd their profit YoY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stock Performance**\n\n$ZIM went public in January this year and has averaged a 100% return every quarter.

The average PE of the shipping industry is  \\~6.9X (nice). While $ZIM trades @ 3.3X. Even if $ZIM were to normalize at the industry's average, that's over a 100% return. If you look at revenue, $ZIM brings in roughly 20% of Maersk's $AMKBY (the largest shipping company by MC) revenue while trading at \\~10% of the valuation.  If you were to normalize $ZIM (66% margin) with $AMKBY (41% margin) based upon net profit, you'd expect a 130% return from the current price of $57. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Comparison across some shipping companies.](https://preview.redd.it/6wve2xa8tz081.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e2984facc1c048ebec1529ea691d516ad1161cb)\n\n**The Next Run**\n\nAfter $ZIM completely destroyed their Q3 earnings ($12.16 vs $8.99 EPS) and announced a market-leading dividend (20% of quarter's net income with a 4th quarter dividend equal to 30-50% of annual net income), and heavy volume has started coming in over the last few days. People are starting to notice. If we assume a similar profit for Q4, their '21 annual profit is \\~$4.5B. We know that based on shares outstanding divided by net income with a 20% dividend is $2.50. This means that their 4th quarter dividend (assumed at the midpoint of 40%) will be $15. At a current share price of $57, you'd basically get **a 26% return just from a single dividend.**  If you don't think boomers and pensions that love dividends aren't going to jump into this stock then go YOLO into some weed stocks (RIP. Long $ROPE). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to Play**\n\n$ZIM's ex-dividend date is Dec 15th so, if you'd like the dividend (like me) you'd have to get in before that date. If you think the stock will massively skyrocket from dividend investors, here's the options chain. You'll notice the most volume taking place at the $60 strike calls.

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t normally do threads like this, but I\u2019m a big supporter of Elon Musk and I follow [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) stock closely. This is going to be a nerdy, conspiracy-theory type thread on Tesla, based on some recent hints from Elon himself.  Take it for what you will; I just think it's fun.\n\nTruth or fiction, it\u2019s still interesting to analyze, and I did happen to stumble upon a connection that seems beyond coincidence -- something which to my knowledge no one else has picked up on.  That made it worth writing about.  We\u2019ll save that bit for last.\n\nSo, Elon is known for leaving breadcrumbs, which are usually only evident in retrospect.   A great example is this now-famous tweet:   You\u2019ll notice that his tweet was sent at 8:11 PST; a stock split was then announced on August 11th (8/11).  \n\n\n[stock price too high tweet](https://preview.redd.it/tdggb6cq3w081.png?width=2250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91f12606102b88ef1495cb70463a3dda77a68ba9)\n\nhere are more examples, but this thread deals with the current speculation over another upcoming [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) split.  Why the speculation?   Well, Tesla\u2019s price is nearing the same levels as when the previous split was announced; that alone is enough to fuel some healthy speculation.\n\nMore interestingly, Elon seems to have been dropping some of his famous hints here and there about when the split might occur.  This hypothetical date is 12/09/21, and some speculators think it will be a 5:1 split, as was the previous split.\n\nNow, most of this speculation is tongue-in-cheek. Just us [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) fans having fun more or less.   Consider this, for example: \"129 orbital flights\" -- an oddly specific milestone -- which some believe hints at the 12/9 date.  Eh. Not super convincing.  \n\n\n[falcon 9 milestone tweet](https://preview.redd.it/yn03ahoz3w081.png?width=1468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01668e9ccad3c8c7885620aa2f8fb3d9df615f03)\n\nOr [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1460982932642877451), from [@garyblack00](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00). \"12 million pounds of thrust.\" Gary noted that there are 9 middle thrusters.   Again, 12/9 appears. And Elon Musk's tweet was sent at 10:20 PST. 10:2, reducible to 5:1. Nothing too firm; maybe just fueling the fire a little.  \n\n\n[gary black noting the raptor engines](https://preview.redd.it/dmha5poe4w081.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=765a579c0421c4d5e651c4b92ac0609ad5497783)\n\ncoincidences? Maybe. But this is where it's gonna start to get weird.  [@garyblack00](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00) noticed an oddity in his excellent  research and analysis.  \n\n\n[gary analysing stock sale](https://preview.redd.it/mlktpyyn4w081.png?width=1484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f8d9aba1567ffcc82efd85d431575ac85521147)\n\nOf all the random blocks of stock Elon has been selling in various amounts, one very specific number has appeared 3 times (so far): 934,091 shares.  At first glance, nothing seems too special about this number. But, knowing Elon, it just seems too specific to be random.\n\nIt took me about 5 minutes before I saw it, and I cannot possibly imagine how all this is a coincidence.   (I also cannot imagine how he reverse engineered this, so there's that too.)  Anyway, here we go. Nerd stuff only from here on out. You've been warned\n\nWe've established that Elon has been (somewhat)  planting the 12/9 number in our heads, leading many to speculate on a 12/09/21 split.  Then this 934,091 number starts appearing. Could they be connected?  What follows is complete lunacy, but it's too perfect not to lay it out.\n\n12/09/2021 can be written as the number 12,092,021.   Let\u2019s divide that by his \"random\" recurring sale number, 934,091. The result?   12.9  Sound familiar?\n\nBut an iPhone calculator gives 6 decimal places by default, so the full number you see is 12.945228.  We've already got 12.9. But what happens if we add up the remaining decimals?  4+5+2+2+8 = (drumroll) 21.  12.9.211231710\n\nCrazy? We've barely even started.  The iPhone shows 6 decimal places by default, but the full iPhone result is: 12.94522803452769.  What if we add \\*all\\* the numbers after the 12.9? This is tricky because we have a zero -- so are we adding 8 + 0, or 80?    Elon may have answered.\n\nIn a recent discussion about the concept of zero, Elon wrote \"Nothing matters\" -- \"nothing\" here referring to zero, in that it \\*does\\* matter -- i.e, include it in the number to get 80.   He then followed it up with this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[elon's tweet on zero being a cool concept](https://preview.redd.it/99zj92pw4w081.png?width=1506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b002072ffab96874114baa209b524366d7a40e5c)\n\n(It's worth noting that Elon's above tweet was sent at 11:34; I mention it because if you return to our full number -- 12.94522803452769 -- you'll notice a 34 immediately after the zero in question.)  Not convinced? Think I'm stretching? Read on.\n\nGo ahead and grant me this \u201czero matters\" thing and let's add up all the numbers in 12.94522803452769, after the 12.9.  4+5+2+2+80+3+4+5+2+7+6+9 = ?  129.\n\nBelieve it or not, we are still not done.   In true [@elonmusk](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk) fashion, he has personally signed this amazing work of art.  Let's add up all the single numbers in 12.94522803452769, just to see what we get.  1+2+9+4+5+2+2+8+0+3+4+5+2+7+6+9 = ?  69.\n\nOne obvious thing I left out that I\u2019d like to add here \u2014 I have no idea if this means a split is happening on 12/9.   Elon could just as easily be trolling; I\u2019m making no predictions here.  I just find it incredible that this much detail, planning, and genius went into this.\n\n\\-Rob Graves",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, this will be a DD report compiled of technicals, fundamentals, and random ass sentiment on why I think Dutch Bros will grow to become a $20B company within 6 months. \n\nThe first starts with growth from their latest earnings report last week. Dutch Bros earned 23 cents per share. That was above FactSet estimates for six cents per share.\n\nRevenue rose 49.8% to $129.8 million, also above estimates for $125.2 million. Same-store sales gained 7.3%, above expectations for a 5% increase.\n\nDutch Bros also forecasts next quarter (Q4) revenue of between $125 million and $128 million. That was above Wall Street estimates for $121.4 million. Despite all this growth, little money was spent on advertising. Most came from word of mouth from the younger generation and their parents who drive them. Looking much further ahead, Dutch Bros plans on expanding to 4,000 stores within 10 years - an aggressive 800% increase from today. \n\nTheir decision to grow company operated stores instead of franchise is why I think their revenue growth will continue to grow exponentially. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the 10-Q:\n\n\u201cCompany-operated Shop Revenue\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2021, company-operated shop revenue grew 62.9% to $108.7 million, as compared\nto $66.7 million in the corresponding prior year period or an increase of $42.0 million. Company-operated shops in the comparable shop base contributed $3.0 million to this increase (4.7% same shop sales), while new company-operated shops\nopened during 2020 and 2021 contributed $39.0 million to this increase. For purposes of calculating company-operated same\nshop revenue growth, company-operated shop revenue for 145 shops was included in the comparable shop base. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, company-operated shop revenue grew 64.7% to $289.5 million, as compared\nto $175.8 million in the corresponding prior year period or an increase of $113.8 million. Company-operated shops in the comparable shop base contributed $11.7 million to this increase (8.3% same shop sales), while new company-operated shops\nopened during 2020 and 2021 contributed $102.1 million to this increase. For purposes of calculating company-operated same\nshop revenue growth, company-operated shop revenue for 120 shops was included in the comparable shop base.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s transition into the fundamentals. Combining all of the information above with the fact that Starbucks missed on revenue for 3 out of the last 4 quarters tells us in a broader sense that the younger generation is gravitating towards Dutch Bros. It has a much different business model with no inside dining, two separate drive thru windows, outdoor dining that optimizes empty space between the building and drive thru,and you\u2019re greeted by a \u201cbroista\u201d who approaches your vehicle rather than a speaker. Customer service and promotions have customers coming back, but most come back simply because the coffee tastes better with more variety than competitors. Dutch Bros doesn\u2019t have to spend money on the overhead of a larger building and their outside dining is popular among kids after school. Their app just launched within the year and already has over 2 million users. Coffee only represents 30% of their sales. This shows us how much variety their menu has.\n\nThe following is kinda random but it fights against the bear case of market cap divided by store count. $10B/500=$20M per store. We know damn well one of these things don\u2019t cost $20M. Are we paying for a store? Or are we paying for the company that runs it? Starbucks has a ratio of $130B/31200=$4M. So a much more established company that owns 62 times more stores than Dutch Bros is getting a 5 times cheaper price per store\u2026 This leaves us with four options:\n1.) Starbucks is 5 times undervalued.\n2.) Dutch Bros is 5 times overvalued.\n3.) The premium is for future growth potential and with 4,000 stores soon making their way east, the market cap/store count ratio would put the valuation at half of Starbucks. If we considered Starbucks as a base for the ratio which Dutch Bros matched, it would put Dutch Bros at $120 10 years from now. Still a 10% increase YoY. \n4.) Looking at Market Cap is pointless. See Tesla for details.\n\nTLDR: Dutch Bros could become the next Starbucks and they only have 25 million shares in circulation. If you have visited and tasted their coffee before, you know it\u2019s possible due to next generation\u2019s preferences and the taste. Very little shares in circulation could send this to $300 if WSB gets behind it. Cramer likes it so maybe we could troll him by making it a meme stock. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nNot sure if anyone will actually read this but thanks for your time and let me know if you think my DD is accurate or if there are flaws. Happy investing!",

        "selftext": "**BUY PayPal stock now** \n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)  price was beaten down after a series of events and yesterday the CEO has delivered a weak guidance despite announcing the partnership with Amazon. They are well established, and they have a solid track record with big growth potential. With the current price, it offer investor a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially to buy at a lower price. \n\n**Lets take a look at PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)** \n\n**Financial Health - no issue** \n\nLiabilities - debt to equity ratio of 42.8% (Total debt 8,945 Million / Total Equity 20,905 Million) as at June 30, 2021. *As interest rate is low, it is an excellent strategy to take on more debts to have more rooms for business expansion.* \n\nDebt Coverage - PayPal is well covered by operating cash flow (64%)\n\nInterest Coverage - PayPal's interest payments on debts are well covered by EBIT (24.7x coverage) \n\nCash &amp; Short term investments USD$12.4 billion \n\n**Earnings - Positive Earning Trend** \n\nTheir profit margin have been growing from 5.2% in year 2014 to 20.4% in year 2021. They have grown significantly by an average of 25% per year over the past 5 years.\n\nHigh ROE - 23.3% (ROE indicates how well a company's management deploys shareholder capital). \n\n**Ownership breakdown** \n\nInstitutions make up 82% of majority of ownership and general public of 17.9% . Big institutional / fund house such as Vanguards, Blackrock, state street global advisors are the top shareholders holding majority of the shares.\n\n**Future - Partnership with Amazon**\n\n PayPal said it had inked a deal with Amazon to allow the firm\u2019s Venmo wallets in the U.S. to be accepted on Amazon\u2019s website and mobile app starting next year. Amazon being the largest e-commerce in the world, has **300 million active users** as of (1 November 2021) and **162 million active users** are from US.  Due to Amazon\u2019s global scope and reach, it is also considered one of the most valuable brand worldwide. This also means that PayPal got to access to Amazon users and the payments can be done through PayPal's Venmo wallets. This is going to be the biggest revenue source going forward. \n\n**Digitalization  - convenience is part of us now after Covid19** \n\nEven economies are re-opening, we are every much used to digitalization where we find convenience in purchasing groceries and items online. Even the economy are open, my family and I still find these habits are to stay, we don't physically go to the stores and pick up items that often because I find (1) the prices online are usually more competitive, (2) I do not need to carry large bulky items home (3) whatever I sees in the stores, I will be able to buy online, so if I am not in a rush, I will still get my items online. My family did the same too. \n\nWith Covid19, it had sped up our pace of digitalization, the baby boomer and generation X who are usually not good with computers and mobile applications are forced to use online payments to minimized human contact. Once they got hold of it, the habits are to stay. My mother had learnt to order Amazon Prime for groceries have been very happy with it, she commented that she got competitive prices like other supermarket, and most importantly, the groceries are delivered right to the doorstep without her going out and carrying the items home which she had to persuade my brother to go with her to help her in carrying. Even economy are opening up, she is still going to continue to do that as she had found the conveniences and comfort of online shopping. And prior to Covid19, even amazon prime was around, she had refused to learn to shop online. \n\n**Forward guidance Vs potential** \n\nI will think the forward guidance from the CEO, Dan Schulman, is an overstatement. He is trying to manage expectations but it came out badly. But as well, it has presented us an opportunity to get the PayPal as the potential is huge.",

        "selftext": " \n\nThis is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. This is my own research on GME and is how I invest. It\u2019s risky and may not be suited for others.\n\n# Introduction\n\nI've written this post before elsewhere but made it very long to explain the market mechanics behind all of this. I'm making this post smaller for the options sub here as not to bore everyone with the market mechanics that cause/generate the meme stock runup cycle.\n\nI'm trying to keep this post within the limits of helping people understand the cycle in it's most basic form &amp; how i personally try to profit off it.\n\nThe vast majority of meme stocks move within this option clearing quarterly cycle but only a handful tend to move up A LOT. The usual suspects are usually the big movers with a few lesser known ones usually mooning in tandem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Let's Go\n\n# The Nov 23 MemeStock Cycle | Section 1\n\nAs you might now, every 90 days, on the months of February, May, August and November, specifically 2 business days after the 3'rd Friday of those months, GME has a bit of a spike upward.\n\nIn this cycle, November 23 e.g next week's Tuesday marks the day where the first and possibly only large spike upwards is bound to happen. I've already explain the mechanics in my DD, now i'm going to explain the cycles and how the last 4 all had slight differences.\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\n# Learning from the Past\n\nWhilst the past isn't indicative of future performance, well sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.\n\nIn this section we'll review the past 3 90 day cycles in order to find commonalities and differences. We can then use these commonalities &amp; differences to build a \"model\" of what the next cycle may generally look like.\n\nOnce we build an image of what the next Nov 23 cycle will look like, well, we will have essentially mostly predicted what will happen next week the the weeks following next week's runup.\n\n**1) February 23**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpt803vsoj081.png?width=2113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30034535b3f904ad42596ca67eb68d45ef6777c7\n\n* **Deposit Period**\n   * This cycle had a distinct dip the 3 days during the monthly options clearing deposit period 17-19 February.\n* **Runup Day**\n   * Next week, this cycle was \"supposed\" to happen on Tuesday the 23'rd, but it instead was delayed by +1 day and it instead start on February 24, a Wednesday.\n* **Drop Day**\n   * As usual, during March 10, the price dropped.\n* **Bonus Anomaly**\n   * The only weird thing about last February was that Monday the 15'th of February was a Bank Holiday &amp; exchanges were closed. It's unknown whether this played a role.\n\n**2) May 25**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzwlbn1uoj081.png?width=2114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8800316e71abc2b91c2cc0ff989c08a5d1acf26f\n\n* **-1 Week Before the Deposit Period**\n   * This cycle had a tiny warmup run the week before. Unknown why.\n* **Deposit Period**\n   * The 2 days before the monthly options clearing deposit deadline (Friday), the price did it's usual and obvious drop.\n* **Runup Day**\n   * The next week just in time on May 25, Tuesday, the price ran up as expected. The next day it even gapped up a bit\n* **Drop Day**\n   * The price predictably dropped around the futures roll on June 9-10 ish.\n\n**3) August 24**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mellw2ouoj081.png?width=2116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81ced8ddbb69a2616473011c32675915558575ce\n\n* **-1 Week Before the Deposit Period**\n   * This cycle had a tiny warmup run the week before. Unknown why.\n* **Deposit Period**\n   * The 2 days of the monthly options clearing deposit period again had a perfectly \"normal\" dip as usual.\n* **Runup Day**\n   * The next week, exactly on schedule, on August 24, a Tuesday, the price of GME ran up. And that was it. It was all sideways after that.\n* **Drop Day**\n   * The futures roll drop was extremely delayed and happened around the 21'st ish of September instead of around the 8'th ish honestly, not sure if it happened at all or in what capacity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Every 90 Day Cycle Has in Common - Section 2\n\n*Here's commonalities and difference between the last 3 cycles and what the 4'th one might look like or in my opinion will likely look like.*\n\n\\-------------------------------------\n\n# In 2 out of 3 cycles, the following happened\n\nHere's what's common in 2 out of 3 runups:\n\n* **1 Week Before the Deposit Period -** The price does a tiny warmup run.\n* **Runup Day -** The price ran up exactly on Tuesday as per NSCC/OCC option clearing rules.\n* **Drop Day -** The price dropped significantly.\n\nThis pattern begins &amp; continues repeating starting from Ryan Cohen's buy-in around August 2020 without fail.\n\nPlugging in[ u/chai\\_latte69](https://www.reddit.com/user/chai_latte69/)'s chart here to show this repeating pattern.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lpdawxhxoj081.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0deef61fde85d2fbfcab16057064333ee8c4e892\n\nLook at **August 2020** onwards since this is when the new GameStop Chair bought his shares in.\n\nIn **3/3** cycles, the following happened.\n\n* **Deposit Period -** The 3'rd Friday of the month &amp; the 2 days preceeding it, the price droppped significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Next Cycle - Section 3\n\n# The Coming November Cycle &amp; It's Possible Shape\n\nIn this section i'll be telling you what the November section will look like if one even happens. It's an estimated image based on the previous cycles.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on the past 3 cycles as well as some additional data &amp; experience having gone through those cycles and vividly remembering them, the following is my estimate on how the next runup will look like.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nlyhkiv7pj081.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1161a721fe38464a9240c465f92eb2903a756414\n\nAs always, this is a vague estimation and not indicative of what the price runup will be. We could go higher or lower or nowhere at all. Here's the link to the[ thing](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/5TUHKREI-The-next-GME-Bull-Run-is-here/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Will November be similar to the past cycles?\n\nWho knows? Nobody. These are my estimates regardless.\n\n* **1 Week Before the Deposit Period -** It already warmed up last week :&gt;\n* **Deposit Period -** I expect no drop this Deposit Period (Wed - Friday).\n* **Runup Day -** I think the price will run on Monday and not Tuesday.\n* **Drop Day -** Drop day is also earning day. We dropped in the last 10/10 earnings. I'll go with the trend.\n\nThis is what i think will happen based on the previous cycles. I also want to believe i'm under-estimating the price it will run to. I'd like to believe we'll see $350+ but that's just my own hopium.\n\nI also believe there will be no drop during the SLD / Deposit period because typically during the entire week (this week) SPY goes red. This week for the first time in a few cycles, it hasn't done that. I see this as a signal of change, something's different this time.\n\nSo since there's been no SPY drop as there usually is, i also believe there won't be a GME price drop during the deposit period. This is just my gut talking, nothing else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What's the Move - Section 3\n\n# Picking your Option Strikes\n\nI use my own tools to figure out which option strikes to pick and when. In this section i'm going to show you what those tools say are good picks only and only for next week's runup. I picked my own options based on what this tool spat out.\n\nThe suite of tools i use is from Hoadley Net. They're a bit complicated and took me a while to understand how to use them.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# What i like in my Options\n\nI can't tell you what to look for. Here's what i look at. I look for a good balance between the 3 nations of Delta, Vega and IV. Others do other things.\n\nI look for:\n\n* **Delta**\n   * I like a Delta that's not too high and not too low. Above 25 but below 90.\n* **Vega**\n   * I like a Vega that as high as possible. Usually the ATM strikes have the highest Vega. If the price however moves up or down, the highest Vega option strike also moves up or down. Due to this, i like to pick a strike that has a high Vega BUT that will continue to have a high vega when the price will move up\n* **IV**\n   * High IV is bad for buying into. IV always drops and it always reduces the value of your option. The only reason to buy into high IV is if you're expecting even higher IV by people buying 1 single strike and nothing else. In my case i like to pick the strikes with the lowest IV. The problem with this is that the lowest IV strikes are ALWAYS SUPER ITM, and so, i have to settle for something around the money.\n\nBased on the above 3 nations, i find a balance between the 3 and decide on my strike. In the next section i'll show you how i picked my current strikes. I personally for good or worse (probably for worse) ignore the other greeks in this kind of trade, but i keep a mindful note of my **Theta** Decay, especially for this kind of trade.\n\n# Finding Implied &amp; Historical Volatility\n\nI first use a tool that tells me the Historical volatility &amp; Implied Volatility for the next 15 Trading Days e.g when GME will do it's quarterly runup.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pn9p5acypj081.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b96e93632d283da60720179a0057376191ae31\n\nThe tool spits out\n\n1. 93% Average,\n2. 99% Upper\n3. 96% for strikes between 200-290 for the next 15 trading days.\n\nI averaged these in my head and decided that i'll use 95% average volatility as my number in the next tool which will tell me which GME options are theoretically cheap/mispriced/on sale or whatever you'd want to call it.\n\nYou can find these volatilties online on Yahoo Finance or other websites. I use this tool because it makes my life easier. (Hoadley Financial tools btw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Option Valuation Analysis\n\nI use the 95% current IV from the previous section to plug in into the next tool called the Valuation Analysis tool. Using this IV as a base number, the tool tells you which options are **underpriced** or **overpriced**.\n\n**Warning: If you use the incorrect data here, you'll get the wrong numbers and wrong valuations and will end up buying the wrong options. Additionally, the screenshots below are 3 day old snapshots and are just an example. You must not trade based on them.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nov 26 Expiring Options**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18run2wfpj081.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a7f4bc62792326b274d375452b091bd719394c\n\nI've added a red boarder around the strikes that interest me. I'm not interested in anything outside this box as it's either overpriced, has little delta, overly high IV which will make me lose money and other variables.\n\nI picked my strike within a similar box, but slightly expanded to $255 because IV was low last week, now anything aboe $235 is no longer viable in my opinion. That's just my opinion. You do you.\n\nNov 26 expiries are risky, but doable. I'm playing mostly these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dec 03 Expiring Options**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij9k398gpj081.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e669b3ee3201f8a0ee307c8e37ec57a203c993d0\n\nI've added the main boarder around the strikes i enjoy. Same as the previous section. I mention Dec 03 because it's \"safer\" if there is such a thing with financial instruments. This is for the risk averse people.\n\nAlternatively the next best thing is to get leaps / long term calls 6 Months, 1 or 2 year expiring calls. This section is to show what i've picked for the current November runup. I already own several ITM leaps.\n\nI've added just a few strikes to my portfolio from the above range just as general \"protection\" vs the high theta decay from the 26 Nov expiring options &amp; the fact that the week of the Nov 26 is a 3.5 day trading week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# My Positions on this Play\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6mqex7bqj081.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63b548a7a7ba500e3bdb013adbc508cf5bc851f0\n\n**Nov 26 Expiring**\n\n* 21 x 212.5 Strike\n* 17 x 225 Strike\n* 1 x 227.5 Strike\n* 18 x 245 Strike\n\n**Dec 03 Expiring**\n\n* 6 x 212.5 Strike\n* 3 x 230 Strike\n* 1 x 240 Strike\n\nMost of the weight of my positions are near the money with a little bit of spreading them upwards up to what i consider to be a semi-safe price range where my trades can still be profitable even with the crazy amount of theta decay.\n\nI bought most of these a bit early so some were mis-priced/on sale and so the theta vs IV increase keeps me sorta safe with them. I bought a few more yesterday at a very minor discount and those have the kind of theta deca vs IV &amp; pricing as you'd expect, they're not great, but they will generate money.\n\nI also own a bit less than 1000 shares that i'm holding due to the fact that these cycles keep pushing the price floor of this stock slightly higher every time the cycle runs. I also have a few leaps for the longer term profit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf there's no rugpull, i expect next week on Nov 23 to see the first big candle on GME &amp; a few other memestocks. I can't tell which other memestocks will runup along with GME or whether some will decouple from the meme short/variance basket at all.\n\nMy bets are on the MemeStock cycle i know which is the GME 90 day cycle starting next week. I thought i'd share in case someone else has been trying to catch these cycles but was unable to quantify them, with this info, i hope things become clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Ze Endo\n\nGodSpeed SG1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gb3p37yhrj081.jpg?width=163&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e8abbb5d676e859a7ecce0d18c5d875c9b45ef8",

        "selftext": "So to all you options traders out there who use Robinhood as your main investing platform, you know how annoying it is when you get a notification that your option was sold at an average price of (insert lowball price here) and by the time you check the underlying it is +5-10%!!!! This happens pretty often because the increased volume at the end of the day. Anyway, here\u2019s how to combat it.\n\nI had the last two trading days off and bought a TSLA call that expired same day. (Judge me all you will). It was a brutal, but 3:02pm (EST) I was given the notification that my order to sell the option was cancelled. Phone in hand, I immediately replaced the order. I noticed that RH has a system where they will re-trigger an automatic cancellation of the option every 10 min, on the 10th min. After that my order was cancelled 3:10, 3:20, 3:30, etc. I sold at 3:54.\n\nIf you are sweating the last day of your option, and still have hope, you have to place an order to sell all contracts at a price that will not execute. EX- underlying $50/share, your strike $51, place an order for $9/contract. Then, you will receive a notification your order is canceled. Now immediately replace the order, because RH will trigger a market order of the option next, but you will have time. Repeat this process until it\u2019s time you want to sell your options, and just press \u201creplace order\u201d and quickly sell it.\n\nHope this helped somebody else, like it helped me! It was a very expensive lesson!",

        "selftext": "There have been a lot of talk about the price of each share reaching 1 million but how could that happen? I know that they have bought the float over again several times. But if they would have to buy back and the price reaches those levels then hedgefunds will go bankrupt, DTCC could probably not cover all of it since it\u2019s literally trillions and they would end up spending ALL of the money they have and not have anything left if even that would be enough to buy back all the shares. \nThen obviously the global economy would collapse since there they would have spent so much and not have any left, and inflation would reach all time highs.\n\nAnd what about the people who have xx,xxx amount of shares? They would end up with 10 billion+ each if the price reaches 1 million a share, you really think they Will get that amount of money? From who? The economy cant sustain that.\n\nNow I\u2019m a holder and I would love for us to become multi millionaires and billionaires. But how could this really happen? Feels too unrealistic\u2026 I still think the price will squeeze and soar and we will become rich but not that rich and wealthy.",

        "selftext": "# As someone who got fucked over by them, I wanted to do this writeup to help others understand how they work and what to lookout for.\n\n**Why are you doing this now?:**\n\nThe first thing you need to understand is that the IRS sees your taxes on a per-year basis. When you see all those tax forms asking you lived in a state until Dec. 31st? Yep, that's the cutoff. They don't give a shit about anything that happens after that when it's time to file. That means that your gains at that time are all that matter. If you made $100k between Jan and Dec 31st and your wife says you need to invest into her CBD oil shenanigans and it goes tits up this January - The IRS only sees you made $100k and you are \ud83d\udcaf% fucked. I have read horror stories [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/mfegx4/reclaiming_my_life_after_being_destroyed_by_crypto/) about people who made tens of thousands in one year and then have to file bankruptcy because they YOLOed it all in Spring and lost. I am not even going to cover wash sales here. Just know if you make money, the government wants to fuck you.\n\n**Short-term gains vs. long-term gains vs. loss:**\n\nALL of your gains become ordinary income. Your income tax bracket will be gains + salary. I'm going to use high-estimates here but feel free to [Please check these brackets for yourself](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp). Expect 37% for your short-term gains and 20% for your long term gains. If you only have losses, you don't have to worry about any of this.\n\n**I made plenty, why should I care?**:\n\nBecause if you have made plenty and already know you are going to pay plenty; this allows you to take on perhaps a more risky move later in the year, because every dollar you are positive the government is going to snatch $0.37 of. \n\nYou also need to consider your method of payment come tax time. I was caught with my trousers down not because I had *squandered* my gains; but because I had *invested* them. Once May came around, turbotax is telling me I owe $20k and have a week to pay it. Which would not be a problem had I set this money aside from the start. But why would I? The dollar is a depreciating asset. Not a chance I was going to let that cash sit in purchasing power. I put it into shares that I could hold for at least a year because I fucking hate taxes! I was willing to do anything that would prevent me from having to withdraw those shares and pay....MORE short-term gains taxes!\n\n**Payment methods:**\n\nYes the IRS does offer payment plans, but they are all through third parties and there isn't too much wiggle room, the further you extend it the worst your interest rate gets. This is where some advanced traders game the system more. A +$10k unavoidable bill some will just open a new credit line, accept all the rewards that come with it and a low APR and slowly work it down.\n\nFor me, I contacted my CC Provider (Discover) and told them straight up that I did not wish to manage another line of credit and asked if they would raise my limit to cover the bill. I have a good credit score and history with them. I also asked them for a few months to pay it off and I wanted 0.0% APR. They gave me a whole year at 0.0%. It is not them just being nice, it is because if I did not finish paying that debt off in a year, my APR would jump to 25% and things can go downhill very quickly.\n\n**Roth account:**\n\nIf you do not have this already, get it now. You need to be maxing this out every fucking year. This is not your Robinhood where every positive cent you make the government gets part of. The shares (and options \ud83d\ude09) you purchase in this bad boy are tax fucking free.\n\n**Who are you?**\n\n[I was poor, then I wasn't](https://i.imgur.com/mg17Vpn.png) and then I found out about taxes. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\nIf you lost money this year ignore everything but Roth. If you made money this year, get ready to be paying 20% minimum come May, and don't do stupid shit and lose it all by then.",

        "selftext": "Background: I\u2019ve been trading options for over a decade and I have no financial or business background. I learned before it was popular online and I am self taught. So I\u2019ll be explaining it the way I was able to understand it. There are better ways, but this is what helped me. I turned $1700 into $500,000 back in 2014. \n\n\nOptions are basically lay aways for shares. So let\u2019s use a house as an example. \n\nIf you bought a house for $1M and I come and offer you $1.2M (the strike price). The catch is I have a certain amount of time to decide if I want the house. You cannot back out but I\u2019m not obligated to buy it. So what\u2019s in it for you? I offer you a $10,000 deposit that you get to keep no matter what happens. Now what? \n\n\nI hold a CONTRACT between us that costed $10,000 and I give myself 6 month expiration date to decide if I want it. So now I am hoping the housing market goes up above $1.2M so let\u2019s go over a few scenarios. \n\nBenefit? I profit on a $1M house as if I own it even though I only paid $10,000. \n\nMARKET RISES\n1. The housing market goes up and it\u2019s now worth $1.4M within 3 months giving me 3 more months on the contract. So the contract is worth at least $200,000 because if I forced you to sell it (exercise). So I can go around and sell the contract to someone else and say \u201clook I can force them to sell for $200,000 today, so give me $200,000 + $20,000 for the 3 months because it could continue to rise. So they pay $200,000 to receive $200,000 in equity and $20,000 premium because the contract still has more time. Meaning if the housing market goes up to 1.5M The new owner of the contract can now exercise the contract (option) and profit $80,000 or 4X their investment. \n\n MARKET DIPS\n2. The housing market dips and the house is now worth $800,000. I would owe you $1.2M so I just wait the 6 months and hope it rises or I sell my contract $10,000 at a loss maybe like $3,000 to someone else hoping it jumps back up. Worse case if the time comes to an end i lose $10,000. \n\nMARKET RISES BUT NOT MUCH. \n1. You do not have to hit the price you bet to earn money. So if the market hits $1.1M within 1 month since there is 5 months left. I can sell the contract to someone else for more now thst it\u2019s more likely to happen. So I can get $20,000 even though it didn\u2019t go over $1.2M. I\u2019m selling the contract to someone else and letting them hope it goes up. \n\nNow translating to stocks. \n\n1 option or contract is 100 shares per contract. \n\nSo if you buy 6 contracts for apple to hit $300 you have 600 shares on hold for you. Every dollar above $300 you earn $600. Because you only owe the owner $300 so everything above is yours. \n\n\nSo your call is you betting it goes up, and if you do a put, you are betting it goes down. Either way you will only ever lose the initial deposit or purchase price of the contract. \n\nStock example I bet Nvidia will hit $360 by feb22 so I needed to pay the owner $15 per share as a down payment. So it was $1500 for the 1 option. Now the closer it gets to the price I said it would hit the price of the contract goes up because it\u2019s now more likely to happen. \n\nSo for example if I said your house will hit $2M by 3 months you wouldn\u2019t believe it would happen so you would accept a lower deposit say $1000 now imagine something happens and 1 week later your house jumps to $1.4M. Since it\u2019s more likely to happen I could sell the contract to someone else for $2500 because it\u2019s not as crazy and I\u2019ve made 150% in 2 weeks. \n\nYou don\u2019t hold a contract till the date, you flip the contract to someone else when you make money on the deposit. \n\nHow are they priced? The crazier your bet the cheaper it is. Tesla at $2000 within 2 months is probably impossible so it would be cheap. Tesla at $2000 by 2024 is more likely so it would cost more. \n\nI turned $1700 into $500,000 from options at 19 back in 2014. But I\u2019ve also lost $100,000 in a day when fedex dipped when gas was low because they buy gas in 6 month intervals. So their earnings were low and the stock dipped. With not that much time left I lost it all. So if it\u2019s your first time, give your self some time in the expiration date . So be careful.",

But this is WSB, corn isn\u2019t allowed\u2014what can we do to profit off this?\n\n**Allow me to introduce $RIOT and $MARA.**\n\nAt its core, every business does one thing: turn energy into money. This is typically done via a combination of humans and machines using energy to create physical products, provide services, or create software. $RIOT and $MARA cut out all that nonsense. All their businesses do is fill warehouses with mining rigs, pump them full of energy, and turn that energy into cold, hard corn.\n\nAs we can see from the beautiful crayon art above, corn prices have been exploding, and should only accelerate through the end of the year. So what does that mean for $RIOT and $MARA? Since their businesses revolve entirely around corn and almost all of their assets are in corn, their share prices correlate very strongly to corn\u2019s price. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$RIOT \\(orange\\) and $MARA \\(blue\\) compared to corn \\(candles\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ywghzqxzd9y71.png?width=2634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b543e814228861fe66264a763ef0fe254116570)\n\nBut wait, $RIOT and $MARA generally move 2-3x more than corn itself, why is that? I have no idea, and I don\u2019t really care. What matters for us is that if corn keeps exploding, $RIOT and $MARA will too\u2014likely at a 2-3x rate of corn itself.\n\n**BUT WAIT THERE\u2019S MORE.**\n\nIf we use call options on these stocks, we increase our leverage even more. If corn does a conservative 3x over the next two months, $RIOT and $MARA will likely be 6-9x, and calls will increase that leverage even more (perhaps another 3x for more conservative strikes and over 10x for more degenerate strikes). **This brings the total estimated gains to somewhere between 5,300% and 26,900%\u2014not too bad.** And what\u2019s the worst that could happen? You lose all the money you put in? Big fucking deal. This play has more asymmetrical upside than anything I\u2019ve ever seen before and probably will see for a very long time.\n\n**POSITIONS OR BAN: Right now, most of my holdings are in $RIOT 12/17 $33 calls, $RIOT 1/21/22 $33 and $35 calls; as well as $MARA 12/17 $70 calls and $MARA 1/21/22 $75 calls.**\n\nHowever, as you can see from the crayons, corn is poised to go exponential, so as that begins to happen, I will sell these positions and move into further out of the money calls to maximize gains.\n\n$RIOT and $MARA have earnings coming up the week of 11/15, and since all of their revenue and assets are based on corn, they should both have phenomenal reports as long as corn\u2019s price stays high. This gives an opportunity for some of the degenerate, out-of-the-money, same-week-expiration calls this sub thrives on. $HUT, another corn mining company, has earnings on 11/11, so that should give us a good idea of what will happen to $RIOT and $MARA after their earnings.\n\nWhen to sell? As of right now, I plan on completely exiting the play around Christmas, but that is subject to change. I highly recommend following TechDev\\_52 on Twitter and watching his indicators for calling the corn top (not my account, and I don\u2019t know the guy. He just gives great analysis). As soon as his top indicators start hitting, I\u2019m out.\n\nMany of the charts also predict a sharp dip in corn after it hits $84,000 sometime mid-November, so there may be potential to sell there and rebuy before the grand parabolic finale.\n\n**Like I said at the beginning, everything I have learned about stocks and options came from this sub, so I am using this as my chance to give back. I have spent the past two years mastering the blade so that when opportunity flashed before me, I would have the tools necessary to maximize it\u2014and it\u2019s finally here.**\n\nI will be back around Christmas to post my gains and give out some Christmas presents. I hope to see you all there. Good luck.",

        "selftext": " \n\n* **Forecast for this week** (see full details on financials further down)\n\nThis week BNTX will shine; Q3 ER on Tuesday and oncology congress 10-14 November (see pipeline below). Moderna missed earning last week and reduced the guidance for 2021; this reduction was not driven by lack of demand, it was driven by delays in manufacturing. BNTX-PFE jumped in and took over the demand Moderna failed to serve. The current drop is still an overreaction of the market to the Pfizer anti-viral which cause a lot of Stop/Loss drops and liquidation of call options.\n\nPfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be $13 Bn, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from $33 Bn to $36 Bn. Consensus estimate is $12.27 EPS Q3. We estimate a somewhat better result, $12.75 at minimum, driven by a/o higher sales volume and improved financing result. Similar to what happened to this stock for Q4 2020 earning on March 31st 2021, the most likely scenario is a rally starting directly after the Q3 earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Market manipulation**\n\nBiontech is a fairly new stock on the Nasdaq and due to its small freefloat of approx. 240m shares, it got highly manipulated by market makers the recent year.\n\nIt seems like big money and algos are trading Biontech and Moderna as only one mRNA-Stock. Both stocks are glued together, although they should have a contrary movement. (i.g. Biontech gets its FDA approval, Moderna goes up; Pfizer reporting a surpass of the quarterly estimates, Moderna goes up). Neglecting some more money flow to Moderna, their movement is sync by seconds on a daily basis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Biontech vs Moderna](https://preview.redd.it/jzdnlgw8vdy71.jpg?width=1532&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31f7184894a27c173037ce47f5e9923f54a6daf5)\n\nBiontech vs Moderna\n\n* **Market share**\n\nPlain and simple Comirnaty is dominating the vaccine race in western world and now rapidly expanding to takeover Sputnik and the Chinese vaccines in Latam and other regions that relied on those vaccines at the start of the pandemic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yq3r2q1cvdy71.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08eb6888077a96c5e8817a944a41a5e6ea7be6d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/34dszcucvdy71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d4c5244f5180ffe235a7b0fa7b347fe081bf70d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Proof of concept**\n\nBiontech was the first company in the world with a real vaccine for corona. U\u011fur \u015eahin was standing beside Donald Trump in front of the White House while announcing this news.\n\nOther companies tried to follow suit, but the most of them failed (i.e. Curevac). Only Moderna could produce another working mRNA vaccine.\n\nThis proof of concept can be extrapolated to all other vaccines in their pipeline and Biontech has the highest likelihood for a good outcome.\n\n\u2022 **Safety**\n\nComparing all vaccines available on the market, Comirnaty has the lowest side effects of all.\n\nAstraZeneca had a lot of issues and is no longer used in the European Union, never got authorized in the US. Moderna has also a higher risk of heart inflammations and it\u2019s use got stopped in countries like Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland for males under 30 years old. The FDA recently authorized under EUA the use of Comirnaty for children over 5 years old. In contrast, Moderna\u2019s authorization for children above 12 got delayed to at least January. The Biden administration has purchased enough pediatric doses to vaccinate 100% of children between 5 and 11 years old. This gives Biontech a monopoly for children vaccination.\n\n\u2022 **Capacity**\n\nThe demand for COVID vaccines is huge and the biggest bottleneck has been and continues to be production capacity and where vaccine manufacturers have struggled. This is where Biontech in partnership with Pfizer have done a stellar job ramping up manufacturing capacity from original 2021 estimate of 1Bn to 3Bn doses for 2021, followed by 4bn doses in 2022 and beyond. To reach this goal they have already a new production building in Marburg Germany with a capacity of 1bn doses a year.\n\nBiontech is also expanding their production all over the world. In 2022, they will start a production building in Singapur and also in Africa with a cooperation with Ruanda and Senegal, in cooperation with the national governments and co-funded by international donors. In addition they have entered in a joint venture with the Chinese company Fosun, plans for and are building another plant with a capacity of 1 bn doses for the Chinese Asian market have been announced.\n\n\u2022 **COVID outlook, from pandemic to endemic**\n\nNo matter which vaccine you\u2019ll take, the protection efficacy is waning. The coronavirus is also mutating constantly to new variants, just like the flu. You don\u2019t need an accurate forecast to realize that the virus is here to stay. All over the world, the governments are starting the 3rd booster jab. Talks about a 4th booster are already taking place. An annual vaccination will be the rule, once again think about the flu, exact same but for a much more deadly and infectious virus. We\u2019ll see a constant cashflow. While most analysts are just too afraid to announce this in public still ignore this, BoFA has been estimating an annual booster demand at the size of flu vaccination demand, 58% of population in industrialised countries. The EU has secured 450m booster doses for each of 2022 and 2023, with an option for doubling should two booster shots per year become necessary. Booster prices have been raised by some 25% or more in most industrialized countries, including EU, USA, and the UK over 2021 prices, with Pfizer seeing further room for increase when comparing with other vaccines, e.g. against Shingles or Streptococces.\n\n\u2022 **Cancer pipeline**\n\nBiontech has a long-lasting experience in cancer research. They are the technical pinnacle with the mRNA cancer treatment currently and way ahead of all other companies in the world. They have four cancer studies in their 2nd phase which are extremely promising. For instance, they cured cancer of 17 mice out of 20 completely. The other 3 mice shrunk their tumors dramatically. A real cure for cancer is ahead of us! There is an upcoming (11/10-11/14) oncology conference called SITC where Biontech has 7 abstract and a late-breaking presentation. The pipeline includes two PD-L1 antibody combination therapies, developed in cooperation with Genmab, which initial reports call \"very promising\". The PD-(L)1 antibody market was some 27 bn USD in 2020, with expected annual growth rates of up to 35%, and includes blockbusters such as Keytruda (Merck). Another presentation will be on BioNTech's novel CAR-T-Cell approach using mRNA, which addresses a potential 10 bn USD market by 2024.\n\n\u00b7 **Social responsibility**\n\nBiontech and Pfizer are donating 1Bn doses at cost to the US government to be donated free of charge to the 90 poorest countries. They have pledged they will donate additional 1Bn doses to the poorest countries.\n\n\u2022 **Pipeline**\n\nBesides Corona and cancer, they are also working on various vaccines. Their flu vaccine developed for Pfizer has entered Phase 1 clinical trial in September. If successful, BioNTech shall be entitled to some 10% royalty on revenue, plus singificant sales-based milestone payments. Other vaccines under development include for Flu, Malaria, HIV, Tuberculosis, as well as a number yet undisclosed diseases.\n\n\u2022 **Financials**\n\nPfizer and BioNTech split Comirnaty gross margins 50/50 worldwide except for China (incl. Taiwan), where BioNTech works in a similar arrangement w. Fosun.\n\n1. **Q3** : Pfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be 13 bn USD, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from 33 bn USD to 36 bn. However, the Pfizer business quarters/ years outside the US are December to November, with a June to August Q3. As such, non US-revenues for September 21 are still missing from their Q3 figures, the same applies to Dec. 21 in their annual guidance. Based on a tally of individual contracts that have been reported publicly, Q3 Comirnaty revenue for calendar Q3 is estimated at some $14.15 bn USD (including $190 m via Fosun), and for 2021 at around $45.6 bn (including $615m via Fosun).\n2. **Q4**: There are still a handful question marks, including the COVAX absorption of US donations. There are more than 100m doses that the US has announced to make available to COVAX in Q4 2021, but which COVAX has so far not allocated and/or assigned a delivery date to. Secondly, there is uncertainty whether monthly delivery of 37.5m booster/Kid vaccine doses to the EU will start in December 21 (Pfizer statement during Q2 ER), or Jan. 22 (EU announcement this summer). Q4 revenue in question is some 850m USD, depending also on the USD/EUR exchange rate.\n3. **Annual 2021:** The $45.6 bn 2021 revenue forecast represents the optimistic scenario. OTOH, contracts with a number of high-income countries, most notably the Gulf States, Israel and Singapore, have hardly been published. Israel has certainly purchased further boosters and kid vaccines for delivery already in 2021, and the same may be assumed for Saudi Arabia, which has already authorized Comirnaty boosters, and shots for 5-11yos, and are preparing for kid vaccination to still start in 2021. Especially Saudi-Arabia, with a population of 34 million, and exclusively relying on Comirnaty boosters and kid vaccines, could be sizeable in this respect. All in all, there might be an upside potential of some good $500M additional revenue 2021 from yet unpublished / unrecorded booster &amp; kids vaccines contracts. Furthermore, should there be delivery delays to COVAX, it may be assumed that some of the supply will be assigned to Taiwan, possibly bringing in another $210M in revenue in December 21 from there, which is currently assumed to only occur in Q1/22.\n4. **Annual 2022:** PFE has pre-announced at minimum sales of 1.7 bn doses Comirnaty, for a total revenue of $29 Bn. Note that this forecast only includes contracts signed by Oct. 15, 2021. I.e., recent contracts announced afterwards as e.g. the US purchasing an additional 50m doses of kids vaccines for 2022, S. Korea buying 30m more doses, the Uruguayan purchase of 3.7m doses, and the 3.5m doses to Costa Rica, shall come on top, as shall be major booster contracts still under negotiation such as 150m doses for Brazil, 55m doses for the Phillipines, 50m doses for Vietnam, and a undisclosed quantity for Malaysia. Moreover, the Pfizer forecast will in all likelihood again relate to the \"Pfizer Year\" outside the US, i.e. 12/21 - 11/22. Importantly, the Pfizer 2022 outlook yields an average price per dose of 17.1 USD. When deducting 800m doses to be supplied as US donation to COVAX at 7 USD/dose, the price on the remainder goes up to even 31.6 USD/dose. This is far higher than the announced booster prices for the US ($24) and the EU ($23), suggesting that most of the other booster contracts already signed, including with Japan, Australia, S. Korea and the UK, should be at prices of 30 USD/dose or above. It also serves as further strong indication of already signed sizeable, and highly priced contracts with several Gulf States, Israel and Singapore.\"\n\nIf a rally starts or not, in the worst case you support a company that saved the world and is working towards curing cancer.\n\n**This is not a not financial advise!**",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Earnings are not going to be good.\n\nCoinbase *seems* like it would be a good play. Earnings last quarter were huge, coin trading is hyped right now, coins are at all time highs, $COIN advertised P/E ratio is very low, etc are all contributing factors to the bull run that $COIN is currently experiencing. Coinbase earnings are releasing the 12th, and it is my opinion that COINBASE earnings will be far lower than expected leading to a large dump.\n\n**Reason 1: Coin prices don't make Coinbase money, but volume does.**\n\nTo put things into perspective, I calculated Coinbase's quarterly trading volume in USD. The numbers speak for themselves. (Source: [https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange](https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange)):\n\nQ1: $337,726,593,729\n\nQ2: $456,237,466,410\n\nQ3: $324,071,319,552\n\n**Reason 2: Q2 Earnings were great! Or were they?**\n\nCoinbase's Q1 income before taxes was $996,666,000. After taxes was $771,463,000 (-$225,203,000)\n\nCoinbase's Q2 income before taxes was $868,881,000. After taxes was $1,606,349,000 (+$737,468,000)\n\nUsing the ratio of Q1 volume/Q1 income = Q3 volume/Q3 income, Q3 income before tax will likely be around 736,403,266 after tax (956,367,877 before).\n\nUsing the ratio of Q2 volume/Q2 income = Q3 volume/Q3 income, Q3 income before tax will likely be around 475,226,528 after tax (617,177,309 before).\n\nHow did this happen? Coinbase received a one time tax credit relating to their IPO. Notice the 12% drop in income even though volume was up 35%. Following this trend, Coinbase will need a substantial increase in trade volume to see any growth.\n\n**Reason 3: Dilution**\n\nQ1's earning report shows that there were 126,996,000 diluted shares (79,373,000 basic) used to calculate their EPS. Q2's earning report shows that there were 248,147,000 diluted shares (204,728,000 basic) used to calculate EPS. If this trend continues into Q3, the earnings per share data could be disastrous.\n\n**Reason 4: Insider selling**\n\nOn November 2nd, the director at Coinbase sold 77,562 shares of $COIN at prices ranging from $326.28-$344.33. The total sold amount was $25,855,002. Insider selling 10 days prior to an earnings report is probably not a good sign.\n\nThanks for reading. My position is 11/19 $295 puts",

        "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese regulators have asked Didi Global Inc.\u2019s top executives to devise a plan to delist from U.S. bourses, people familiar with the matter said, an unprecedented request that\u2019s likely to revive fears about Beijing\u2019s intentions for its giant tech industry.\n\nThe country\u2019s tech watchdog wants management to take the company off the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said. \n\nProposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesday\u2019s close. \n\nShares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didi\u2019s biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo.\n\nDeliberations continue and it\u2019s possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nDidi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijing\u2019s municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares. \n\nDidi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company\u2019s U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies Inc. are Didi\u2019s biggest minority shareholders.\n\nEven if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag.\n\n \n\nRegulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the world\u2019s largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms\u2019 books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.\n\nDidi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinping\u2019s administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or \u201ccommon prosperity,\u201d has targeted an internet sector that\u2019s accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.\n\nA state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didi\u2019s stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the country\u2019s internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in China\u2019s largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc. \n\nBeijing\u2019s moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi\u2019s IPO decision as a challenge to the central government\u2019s authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi\u2019s offices in July.\n\nIt\u2019s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that\u2019s traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-asks-didi-to-delist-from-u-s-on-security-fears-1.1687281",

        "selftext": " Now that Fastly is skyrocketing following Akamai's earnings, it seemed like a good time for me to enter with a bearish play. Be careful: this is not a full DD, expectations for Fastly are quite low and it has been beaten down a lot already, so going bearish can be very risky. Doubly so if you simply buy puts, which have very high IV for Fastly. I'm only using house money on this play. Enter at your own risk and limit your exposure.\n\n**Reasons for play**\n\n1. Trends in their employee base I [posted about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjw4pq/fastly_fsly_seems_to_be_losing_lots_of_employees/)\n2.

Amazon and Shopify also reported tepid earnings. However, some like Ticketmaster or Foursquare are doing well. As Fastly works with a usage-based business model, this could immediately affect their numbers\n3.

        "selftext": "Inflation is a persistent issue coming out of the COVID lockdown economy and continues to create a great amount of confusion for the retail investor space. Many retail traders don't know what it means or how to respond. More specifically, many are having trouble with tailoring their portfolios to either avoid risk or take advantage of inflationary circumstances. I aim to somewhat remedy this. I hope the pointers below will help you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. This is not the end all or be all and I welcome your observations and comments on what I could have missed. Enjoy this and lets make some money taking advantage of these once in a lifetime economic circumstances.\n\n* **Inflations is Measured by a Change in Rate:** Inflation doesn't usually go down. The RATE of inflation goes up or down, but inflation itself is persistent. This is by design. Could you imagine what would happen to the economy if you knew that your dollar would be worth more tomorrow than it is today? Spending on goods other than necessities would come to a very dramatic reduction. So it is important to understand that what we are looking at is the CHANGE IN RATE of inflation. There is no deflation!! Deflation is 1000x worse for the economy than inflation. So do not expect deflation. The Fed simply will not allow it. Nor should they!\n* **Current Inflation is Largely a Result of too Much Demand:** During the COVID lock downs many businesses were forced to grind their operations to a halt. Remember food, toilet paper, &amp; other essentials flying off the shelves? Indeed many grocery stores were limiting the amount of water you could buy. It only stands to reason that when you force businesses to close down you create a situation where the goods that people demand are not being replaced by a steady supply. So what happens as the economy opens back up? Suddenly those same businesses have reduced inventories, they need to hire back workers, they need to order new supplies, &amp; they need to meet an increased demand as a result of some competitors closing their doors for good. Now the quantity of goods demanded well exceeds the quantity of goods supplied ... on all fronts. Reopening firms are competing against other reopening firms for the same raw materials, supplies, resources, shipping, etc. They are also competing for the same labor pool. Remember that goods &amp; services in times of extreme scarcity go to the highest bidder.\n   * **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand (Or too Little Supply):** Below you will find the inflationary issues we find ourselves in as a result of increased demand and limited supply. Below each topic you will also find some examples of how to profit from each. You will also receive some examples of secondary and tertiary effects of each.\n      * **Supply Chain Bottlenecks:** First and foremost in the news are the supply chain bottlenecks. We've all seen the ships floating off the Port of Los Angeles, or the very long line of trucks waiting to pick up freight from the ports. The United States &amp; Europe have but a limited number of ports and they're taking on all the supplies that firms ordered as the economy opened back up. Making things worse ... its holiday shopping season. So cost of shipping dry bulk overseas is not just rising as a result of increased demand, but as a result of the fact that it costs money to have all these carriers waiting weeks to offload their goods. Making matters worse many of the imported goods are perishables which can spoil and reduce the supply of foodstuffs amid an already high demand. As a result many firms are opting for alternative methods of shipping like the much more expensive option of air freight. **(*****Note: Moderately bullish on sea freight carriers, rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**\n      * **Supply Chain Shortages:** As if the bottlenecks weren't bad enough, there are but a limited number of domestic shipping firms. Firms that not only transport materials to businesses, or, finished goods to retailers, but also delivering orders to retail shoppers. Here we are once again talking about rail, trucking, mail delivery, air freight, logistics firms, logistics outsourcing, etc. So yet again we have an increased demand for shipping and logistics with but a limited supply. And while this demand will keep up for some time, many firms know it will eventually come back down to normal, and therefore, are very hesitant to expand too fast too quickly for fear that they will one day have too much fleet for future business. **(*****Note: Moderately bullish on rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**\n      * **Semiconductor Shortages:** Everything these days has a semiconductor. Whether its semiconductors, passive semiconductors, diodes, you name it, chances are if it was an electronic made in the last 5 years, it needs a semiconductor to properly operate. Indeed before the supply chain shortages hit critical mass, we were dealing with semiconductor shortages. Now we will not likely fix the semiconductor issue until we fix the supply chain issue. Once again as the economy opened back up &amp; demand skyrocketed, semiconductors too experienced a complementary spike in demand. Semiconductors alone are preventing the automakers from producing at full capacity. There are not enough semiconductors to make vehicles. And with the holidays on the horizon semiconductors are in higher demand than ever. Even Sony had to reduce the number of PlayStations they could manufacture and ship due to component shortages and logistics issues. So expect the price of any new electronic device that has a semiconductor to increase in price. **(*****Note: Bullish on electronics &amp; semiconductors*****)**\n      * **Vehicle Shortages:** As noted with the semiconductors, vehicles are in short supply. As a result the quantity of vehicles demanded exceed the quantity of vehicles supplied. Therefore we not only have a shortage of vehicles but the price o vehicles have skyrocketed. Have you seen the empty lots at your local dealership? There's nothing to sell! People are ordering direct from factory. As a result people turned toward used vehicles which now are also in short supply. As a result people who could not afford the increased price of used vehicles resulted to maintaining their current vehicles. And as a result of people maintaining their current vehicles, the demand for auto parts &amp; auto mechanics have skyrocketed. And I don't know many large firms that do not need a frequent supply of vehicles to maintain operations. (*Moderately bullish to bullish on used car firms, auto parts, and car repair*)\n      * **Raw Material Shortages:** Raw materials were the first to explode out of COVID. Wood, steel, ore, oil, &amp; minerals ... you name it, its all going up. The quantity of supply demanded exceed the current supply ... and for many reasons. **(*****Moderately bullish on miners, steel, mining equipment suppliers, and oil/gas producers ... see energy shortage below for more detail on oil/gas*****)**\n      * **Increased Demand for Housing:** Largely as a result of low interest rates incentivizing lending, we experienced a housing and construction boom in the middle of a Pandemic. Houses and industrial builds in many areas have skyrocketed in value. But this was not only as a result of low interest rates. When the federal government instituted a ban on evictions from rental properties, many took advantage by simply not paying their rent. The forgone payments to the landlord forced the renter to pass on the costs on to new tenants, which increased the cost of rental properties beyond that just owning a home in many areas. So people bought homes instead. Moreover many people moved out of urban areas to escape burdensome COVID restrictions which furthermore increased the demand of housing. Furthermore lifetime renting millennials saw the low interest rates as a great time to buy their first home. Finally, mortgage forbearance reduced a lot of foreclosures during COVID. Less foreclosures means less supply, less supply amid high demand results in higher prices. **(Note:** ***Not very bullish on housing &amp; real estate at this time but still moderately bullish on construction, furniture, paint, fixtures, and infrastructure***\\*\\*).\\*\\*\n      * **Energy Shortages:** As we began to put the COVID economy behind us, more people are travelling to work, to school, and going on vacation. More recently international travel is opening back up.  Moreover firms are expanding rapidly to meet demand and shippers are using more energy than ever. This all of course increases the price of oil, natural gas, jet fuel, and the fuel you pay at the pump. Making matters worse, no matter what your politics are, the current administration in the White House is the most ardently unfriendly domestic coal and fossil fuel administrations we've had in 5 years. OPEC, perhaps realizing that such demand will be but temporary for the next 1-2 years, refuses to entertain the Biden administrations request to ramp up oil supply. Oddly enough big oil hasn't been in this good of a position for the last 4 years where the increase of supply made it seriously hard for oil firms to profit. Energy is used for producing everything. When energy goes up the cost of everything goes up. When energy goes up, people spend more on energy and less on other things. So the increase in energy costs are a result of both increased post COVID demand and politics. Of all the issues we are experiencing with inflated prices, energy is among the easiest to fix. **(Note: B*****ullish on oil, natural gas, oil and natural gas equipment maintainers and suppliers, and perhaps oil exploration if the Biden administration would quit putting up road blocks***\\*\\*)\\*\\*\n      * **Worker Shortages:** \"Worker Shortages\" is misleading. When people think of a \"worker shortage\" they generally think that we don't have enough workers to meet demand. They would be correct. But we should phrase it as \"firms do not have enough workers to meet CURRENT demand.\" Lets face it we are rear view looking creatures. Simply because a firm doesn't have enough workers does not indicate that they cant beat previous profit/revenue, but rather they can not only beat previous revenue projections, but also be in a position where they cannot meet CURRENT demand. And just like anything else, when the quantity of labor demanded exceeds the quantity of labor supplied, we run into increased labor costs ... namely wages. And wages are overwhelmingly the highest cost for most firms. **(Note:** ***Bullish on staffing and outsourcing firms***\\*\\*)\\*\\*\n   * **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand ... Conclusion:** Lets keep this simple. You want to buy a car. That car is made from raw materials such as aluminum &amp; steel. The car requires electronics. Those electronics require semiconductors. You need a labor force to put that car together. You need energy to manufacture that car. You need truckers &amp; freighters to ship those cars or bring manufacturers the materials to make cars. You need equipment to make cars. In short 100% of the price of all components of that car, or the components used to make that car, have gone up. Still, you have a high demand market where people and businesses require vehicles, but the manufacturer cant meet that demand due to the lack of supplies available. Nevertheless the vehicle manufacturer still needs to pay for overhead costs to keep the doors open. And as so many people are demanding such a short supply of cars, the manufacturers simply increase the price of that car to meet the demand of the highest paying bidders. And this phenomenon is happening in each step of the chain to make that car from the folks who supply the materials, to the folks who produce the energy, to the folks who ship the finished product. When the quantity of goods demanded exceed the quantity of goods supplied, prices necessarily must go up.\n* **Monetary Drivers of Inflation:**  As a result of the dramatic initial downward shift in demand amid COVID lockdowns, the Federal Reserve made money cheap, essentially lowering interests rates to both incentivize borrowing and make borrowing more affordable. The result? Massive influxes of borrowing and lending which in turn flooded the economy with cash. At first this excess cash was used to make it through the pandemic. Later this cash was used by firms to expand rapidly to meet demand. People also used cheap money via extremely low interest rates to purchase homes, which increased the demand for housing. Eventually the Fed is going to need to raise interest rates to disincentive lending and cool off a hot economy. If allowed to persist for too long the influx of cash will lead to investments by firms looking to to stave off losing the value of money via inflation and thereby creating a massive bubble. There are already indicators of this happening by virtue of equity valuations in the market. (*Note: the Fed has also been incentivizing investment in the stock market by buying treasury bonds on the secondary market which resulted in keeping the yields artificially low. As a result people were less inclined to buy treasury bonds and more incentivized to invest in other equity*).\n* **Government Drivers of Inflation:** The rapid inflation we are experiencing has not deterred President Biden for advocating for trillions in spending measures. The U.S. Government is a customer just like anyone else, and the government competes for the same goods and services you and I do. Increased spending will to some extent result in crowding out the private sector that competes for the same goods and services. Remember that an increase in demand with limited supply generally results increased prices. If the government spends too much, it can seriously hurt consumers in the form of increased prices. Moreover the Biden administration isn't the most friendly administration when it comes to mining for coal, oil, minerals, etc.. This inevitably leads to increased costs of energy and raw materials. (*Note: This comment used a political figure as an example of a negative economic consequence. Do me a favor, take the example for what its worth to you, and realize I am not going to entertain heated political discussion. There is a cost and benefit to everything, and I don't have the time to entertain the talking points you pulled from a political webpage or favorable news site and tell you why you're wrong, when no matter how much the evidence is stacked against you, you're not going to change your mind anyway. Ergo a massive waste of time that benefits no one*).\n* **Inflation is Excellent for Debt!:** I will keep this one quick. Lets say you took out a 30 year fixed mortgage in 1990. You paid $90,000 for your home and have a mortgage of $400 per month. In the year 2019 your home is now worth $200,000 in market value but you're still paying $400 per month at a fixed rate. Through inflation your wages have eventually increased while your fixed rate mortgage remained stagnant. In short, you may have been scrimping for pennies when you took out the mortgage, but years later you can make your payment while working at a fast food restaurant. Neat huh? Inflation is excellent for debt ridden companies. As their profit margins increase over time through inflation they will find it much easier to pay off their long term debt. (*Note: Perhaps this put some of the companies you were looking at into better perspective, and if debt was a major factor for not investing, then you may or may not want to revisit your decision.*)\n* **Bullish Sectors You Can Profit From that I did not Mention Above:** Industrial Chemicals, Industrial Equipment, Fertilizers, Farm Equipment/Construction, and Pesticides. As firms ramp up production they will increase the demand for industrial chemicals. Moreover, as food prices continue to increase the more land farmers will be incentivized to clear for additional farming which requires more farming construction, farming equipment, chemicals/pesticides, and fertilizers.\n* **The Canary in the Inflation Coal Mine:** If the change in prices rise beyond the change in incomes to the point where people need to start economizing their necessities and forgoing their wants, we could be looking at a very serious correction.\n\n**Conclusion:** I hope the pointers above have helped you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. Please understand that I will be reading this over and over again to identify typos &amp; unclear sentences. I may even edit it as people bring ideas to my attention.

Potential targets are not going to hardball these guys for an inflated valuation as they need to curry favor with these insiders since most of the income in this space comes via government contracts.\n\n$PIPP drew a lot of interest when it originally IPO\u2019d with commons reaching a high of $14.94 and warrants $4. It took a pummeling like many pre-DA SPACs did during the spring when both institutions and retail got burned out on too many crappy SPAC deals coming down the pipeline. Now we see institutional money flowing back into some of the better SPAC deals and retail has followed, causing the better SPACS to see a big run up, most recently $GGPI/Polestar.\n\nWhy $PIPP now? Well this stock has been dead for months and months then suddenly started to pull volume, it was a top 5 ticker for SPAC volume last week. Warrants are up nearly 50% already with large buys rolling in. There has also been a large buying of calls with almost 5,000 Open Interest on the January 10c with 10% of that opened just on Friday. It is my belief based on this movement that a merger target will be announced by the end of the year and based on the team I am willing to bet it will be a good one. Its been 11 months since $PIPP IPOd and the average time from IPO to merger announcement for SPACs also happens to be 11 months so the timing fits.\n\n**Warrants and Why I Like Them**\n\nFor anyone not familiar with SPACs they IPO originally as a unit which is a common share bundled with a warrant or partial warrant. The typical SPAC warrant allows you to buy a common share for up to 5 years post merger for $11.50. They are a bonus sweetener to the funds who buy the SPAC IPO, those funds typically try to sell the commons for a few cents over what they paid post unit split then keep the warrants as a \u201cfreebie\u201d of potential upside if the SPAC does well post merger. Anyone can buy these warrants though (except Robinhood users - sorry) and have access to the benefits of what is essentially a 5 year call option that doesn\u2019t suffer theta decay.\n\nThe other benefit of warrants is leverage. If commons are $10 and warrants are $1 and you have $10,000 to invest you can buy 1,000 commons or 10,000 warrants. If commons go to $11 you make a $1,000 or 10% return. Warrants would go to $2 giving you a $10,000 or 100% return. The downside of this higher reward is as always higher risk. If no merger happens SPAC commons can be redeemed but warrants go to 0. I see a very minimal chance of that happening with this SPAC and this team. As stated above I believe a merger announcement is imminent.\n\nDisclaimer: I hold a position in 10,000 $PIPP warrants opened last week.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve made and continue to make mistakes trading options, but every mistake makes me better and helps ensure I take a step back and don\u2019t get complacent. I\u2019ve committed to posting regularly to save others the pain of losing if I can and to help cement what I\u2019ve learned in my own head. I hope this post helps. It\u2019s not at all meant to show off, as I\u2019ve traded sideways in this IRA account for several months now, but recently changed strategies and they are working despite a little pull backs the past couple days. \n\n**Buying &amp; Selling Pfizer**\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of headlines about Pfizer lately, most of it very good news. So it\u2019s not surprising that the stock has been moving up. But it\u2019s wildly undervalued in my opinion. Prior to Covid, the stock was trading around $38 per share with about 50B in revenue. Last quarter alone they did $24B in revenue with sales boosted by the vaccine sales. Not only will this revenue trend continue, but they will be adding capacity to sell 21 million doses of the Covid-19 oral therapy next year at $700 a dose. That\u2019s another $15B of revenue. \n\nThe naysayers think these sales figures are short-lived or will wane quickly with the virus, but to this I say two things: first, it doesn\u2019t matter, money is money. Second, they are not accounting for the fact that 90 governments have already stepped forward to begin purchasing and stockpiling these pills to avoid the sort of supply chain issues everyone was having when the vaccines first appeared. So even if no one takes the pills, they will be purchased and stored. The U.S. has already ordered \u201cmillions\u201d of the anti-viral pills. \n\nPfizer expects vaccine sales of 36B in 2021 and 29B in 2022. Add to that the anti-viral pills and they are going to be hitting $44B in covid drugs next year - that\u2019s the entire revenue of previous years and does not count any sales from their other products. Now, they do share revenue with BioNTech, so we need to discount the vaccine sales by half, but that still equates to almost $30B more revenue next year.\n\nTo the naysayers that argue this revenue is short-lived: we don\u2019t yet know that is true as this virus has proven to be tricky and it\u2019s likely the covid shot is the new annual flu shot, as was the case with swine flu. More importantly, the profit from these drugs will fuel a major acquisition spree. They can go buy their next blockbusters without R&amp;D risk.\n\nSo what am I doing about all this? I bought 30 Jan23 options contracts $40 strike when Pfizer dipped last month. I sold 10 last week for a 100% gain. I\u2019m going to ride the remaining 20 up to a price target of $65 a share. I will pick up more on any major selloffs. \n\n**I Loaded Up on CROX**\n\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about this stock, which I have been trading for a couple years now because I don\u2019t like holding through the volatility. The short version is, they are absolutely killing it and despite initial concerns about potential knock offs and rubber shortages, people continue to stay brand loyal and buy them up. When you walk down the street and see half the kids wearing them, you know they have done something amazing with their brand. And they financials show it: \n\n425% earnings growth\n\n73% revenue growth\n\n65% gross margin (incredible)\n\nP/E of 15\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to find bargains in this market, but when CROX pulled back in October, I bought some 2023 calls when the price rose above 140 (because I could tell the momentum was under it then). It\u2019s hanging around 174 right now and normally I would have exited but because of my past trades of getting out a little early, I sold my original investment and am going to hang on to the rest until the stock crosses 200.  \n\n**I Bought On QualComm\u2019s Buyback**\n\nOn Oct 12th, I got an alert from my favorite new system, LevelFields, that QualComm would be buying back $10B worth of stock aka 7% of the company at the time. IMHO there is no stronger signal to the market of a company\u2019s financial health than a buyback. It means, typically, that the leadership is so confident in the market position, sales, cash flow, and economic environment that they\u2019d rather repurchase stock than spend more money to grow revenues or save for a rainy day. \n\nWhen the buyback occurs before earnings are out, it\u2019s a good sign it\u2019s going to be a blockbuster earnings report. When the news hit, the stock was trading at 122/share. Sure enough, when earnings came out in November, they crushed it. Record revenue, beat earnings consensus by 13% ($2.55/share), and upped guidance revenue going forward. \n\nI bought the Jan 2023 calls at a 140 strike price and intend to hold them until the stock reaches 200. \n\nThe stock hit 170 recently and had a bit of a pullback on what appears to be profit taking and inflation worries.\n\nThere\u2019s some volatility ahead but I will hold through the chop this time because the company is on the right path and the analysts are all calling for 185-204 ranges. \n\n**I Bought and Sold Puts on Pullbacks** \n\nA strategy I\u2019ve grown to love is selling puts towards the end of a pullback on stocks I want to own. I did this for Visa after its earnings sell-off at the end of October. Now, I have owned Visa since its IPO and the position has grown quite large over time so I\u2019ve been trimming it over the years and now look for ways to profit from trading it. Headed into earnings, I suspected a good chance of a pullback and got ready to sell the dip. \n\nAs expected, it sold off, got hit with a government antitrust investigation, and tumbled some more. On the government investigation news, I sold puts on it when it had fallen 10% down to the 210 level and raked in the premiums. \n\nI like using Fidelity\u2019s options analyzer to help ensure the puts I\u2019m selling fall outside at least one standard deviation from expected price movements. It\u2019s one of the more helpful ways of visualizing where to aim.\n\nI also bought puts on Visa prior to earnings at the money for one week out with an order to sell once I hit a $10,000 profit. It sold off in a few hours and I got the Fidelity notification I had just made $10,000 in a day while making lunch. \n\nThere are some more trades I made, but I\u2019m out of time for writing today so hopefully can come back to those another time (UPST, INMD, UCTT, CELH).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[25&amp;#37; in cash, 75&amp;#37; invested in this account for effective return of 36&amp;#37; until the recent pullback](https://preview.redd.it/tn38hd19nyy71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12693a0d345ce0838452cfb8f0e7f5ba893a8af5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xen04fvhnyy71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb6614d4f6e2a30e69f53e81f09cd6242683c6d",

        "selftext": "Hi fellow retards, been a fellow lurker for a few years now but decided to post because I recently shifted my stance on $INTC and figured I should get the full smooth-brain experience by getting roasted by my fellow apes.  \n\nI figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intel\u2019s strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. \n\nFirst of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&amp;D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how they\u2019ve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). \n\nOn the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is \u201ca threat to our economic security\u2014and by extension, to our national security\u201d](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. \n\nThere is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if you\u2019re also smooth brained, you likely know it\u2019s INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china want\u2019s to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). \n\nYou know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and they\u2019ve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).\n\nIntel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm",

        "selftext": "**BULL CASES**\n\n/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.\n\n/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.\n\n/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.\n\nFor reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).\n\n/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.\n\n/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.\n\n/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.\n\n/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.\n\n*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*\n\n/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.\n\n/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.\n\n/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.\n\n/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.\n\n/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?\n\n/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Bear Cases**\n\n/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.\n\n/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.\n\n/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.\n\n/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.\n\n/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.\n\n[positions or ban. bought 100 shares for now. will be selling some puts to enter into more.

        "selftext": "# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n* Stocks rose to a new high as traders reduced their expectations on the Fed's rate of tightening, while bond yields fell.\n* The S&amp;P 500 was led higher by technology and retail stocks, while the NASDAQ 100 extended its winning streak to a ninth straight day, the longest since December. A positive outlook from semiconductor giant Qualcomm contributed to evidence that the industry's squeeze is lessening. Short-maturity Treasury yields fell as global investors reviewed the future for monetary policy after the Bank of England defied expectations by leaving interest rates unchanged.\n* The decision came after weeks of speculation that the BoE would be the first major central bank to boost borrowing costs since the pandemic began. It also occurred a day after Fed's Powell announced the beginning of a pullback in asset purchases while indicating policymakers may be patient with rises. Interest-rate futures contracts, which had priced in two quarter-point increases in 2022, pushed the second one into 2023.\n* \"We thought the amount of market pricing for Fed hikes really around the middle of next year was very full, and that should come down,\" said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Global Research.\n* Saudi oil output will top 10 million barrels per day for the first time since the pandemic, according to al Arabiya TV.\n* OPEC+ decides to ease cuts by 400k in December - sources.\n* JMMC supports no change to OPEC policy of easing cuts by 400k bpd - sources WTI weakened\n* Traders push out the first 15bps BoE hike to February, and see 1% in September.\n* BoE Gov.

        "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** **SPY** was higher by about 1.7% (or $7) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY about **$468**, that corresponds to just above **$473** on the upside and around **$463** on the downside.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX ended Friday around 16.50, up slightly from the week before and up a bit to end the week from lows it saw under 15 mid week. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\nOptions are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:\n\n* SPY **1%**\n* QQQ **1.5%**\n* IWM **2.0%**\n* DIA **1.1%**\n\nAs an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here\u2019s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $463 and $472 to see Max Gain:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfun2vgje8y71.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc34590345aba5a79ba116143186fd10f5534c94\n\n### In the News\n\nElon Musk posted a Twitter poll over the weekend asking whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. He followed with a tweet saying he would abide by the poll. \u201cYes\u201d won. It\u2019s unclear what would happen next, as Twitter polls are generally not considered legally binding. Tesla options are pricing about a 6% move for the upcoming week and about 12% for the remainder of November:\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nThe *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter.\n\nMonday\n\n**Paypal** PYPL / [Expected Move: **6.1%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/Z) / Recent moves: -6%, +2%, +7%\n\n**AMC** AMC / [Expected Move: **13.3%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/AMC) / Recent moves: -6%, +6%, +4%\n\nTuseday\n\n**Palantir** PLTR / [Expected Move: **8.4%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ATVI) / Recent moves: +11%, +9%, -13%\n\n**NIO** NIO / [Expected Move: **7.1%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ATVI) / Recent moves: -3%, +2%, -13%\n\n**Wynn** **Resorts** WYNN / [Expected Move: **5.3%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ROKU) / Recent moves: +8%, -1%, +8%\n\nWednesday\n\n**Disney** DIS / [Expected Move: **4.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/QCOM) / Recent moves: +1%, -3%, -2%\n\n**SoFi** SOFI / [Expected Move: **10.4%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FSLY) / Recent moves: -14%\n\n**Beyond Meat** BYND / [Expected Move: **8.3%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ETSY) / Recent moves: +2%, -7%, +1%",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 4, 2021**\n\nThe good times keep on rolling! The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the \u201csubstantial progress\u201d benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.\n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nSpecifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on \"changes in the economic outlook.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. \n\nNew weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion. This is the next $1 trillion stock IMO. The surge happened due to Wells Fargo raising price target $330, citing the metaverse as a major growth contributor\n* According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) are working out how quickly the rental car company can receive its 100,000 cars delivered\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5\\&amp;amp;reflink=article\\_copyURL\\_share](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share)\n\n* Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for \"green\" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.\n* Britain could speed up a move to make the executives of big techs firm criminally liable for harmful content on their platforms if they do not take action to tackle the problem, Digital Minister Nadine Dorries told lawmakers on Thursday.\n* Google is pursuing a massive cloud-computing contract with the Department of Defense, nearly three years after abandoning a similar bid process in the face of employee protests.\n* Google said on Thursday it plans to allow third party payment systems in South Korea in order to comply with a new law that bans major app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Oppenheimer from $296 to $307 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n* Stocks rose to a new high as traders reduced their expectations on the Fed's rate of tightening, while bond yields fell.\n* The S&amp;P 500 was led higher by technology and retail stocks, while the NASDAQ 100 extended its winning streak to a ninth straight day, the longest since December. A positive outlook from semiconductor giant Qualcomm contributed to evidence that the industry's squeeze is lessening. Short-maturity Treasury yields fell as global investors reviewed the future for monetary policy after the Bank of England defied expectations by leaving interest rates unchanged.\n* The decision came after weeks of speculation that the BoE would be the first major central bank to boost borrowing costs since the pandemic began. It also occurred a day after Fed's Powell announced the beginning of a pullback in asset purchases while indicating policymakers may be patient with rises. Interest-rate futures contracts, which had priced in two quarter-point increases in 2022, pushed the second one into 2023.\n* \"We thought the amount of market pricing for Fed hikes really around the middle of next year was very full, and that should come down,\" said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Global Research.\n* Saudi oil output will top 10 million barrels per day for the first time since the pandemic, according to al Arabiya TV.\n* OPEC+ decides to ease cuts by 400k in December - sources.\n* JMMC supports no change to OPEC policy of easing cuts by 400k bpd - sources WTI weakened\n* Traders push out the first 15bps BoE hike to February, and see 1% in September.\n* BoE Gov.

        "selftext": "Welcome to the weekend update!\n\nAnother great week (as expected)! We leveraged up at the bottom and have been unloading into the predicted rally. Portfolios are still strongly biased towards a continued upmove but the current leverage was reduced to 1.5/1.6. Meaning a 10% move should make us 15-16% overall (it goes both ways). That's why taking profits is king. Those were the profits taken this week.\n\n\nDD +15% (3 trading days)\n\nQCOM +21.2% (18 trading days)\n\nEXPE +8.3% (5 trading days)\n\nGE +9.4% (34 trading days)\n\nSBUX +4.7% (19 trading days)\n\nLeveraged ETFs:\n\n30% of URTY +33% (now I only own 30% of the initial position)\n\nBut let's cut to the chase: Portfolios are up 49 and 40% year to date while the best performing US Index is up 27% (NDX100). An international benchmark mix (60% US) is only up 17.8% because Brazil and Asia were tanking again.\n\nAs always there is no way to post charts on reddit/stocks so I will explain what I see!\n\nNDX100: It all started with the extremely low MACD readings late September and October. I had posted that it was a buying opportunity. Obviously laughed at by redditors but I like being attacked and laughed at because that means chances are I am right. Around that time investor sentiment was net negative 4 weeks in a row. Just 1 year after a recession that is a buying opportunity! Anyhow. NDX100 made 14% since the low and broke above the highs from early September. Because many were left behind we went up in a straight line!\nAs long as we can stay above the breakout area of 15700 we will continue to go higher. Expect a test of the area around 15700 but the minimum target should be 17000. If we make it in a straight line or not depends on how much FOMO all the bears from September have.\nI am a swing trader so I already took a profit of 15% on TQQQ. The main reason was to deleverage on the way up.\n\nDisclaimer: I own QQQ, FB, Amazon longterm. \n\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 15700\n\nDJI: Same is true for DJI as for NDX100. Watch the 35500 level. I also realized already a 13.8% profit on UDOW. \nMinimum target 37250.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 35500\n\n\nS&amp;P500: Watch 4550 level. Also broke above and confirmed bullish bias. Minimum target 4800.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 4550\n\n\nRussell 2000: Russell 2000 is my favorite US Index right now and the only index I still own leveraged ETFs on. It had a rough 2021 trading in a trading range for at least 8 months but it finally woke up and it could run at least 10% from here still. This week alone it made 6%. I predicted the Russell to outperform NDX, S&amp;P, DJI until end of year and I still think more money can be made with small caps.\nFor deleveraging purpose I had sold another 30% of URTY. Gain was 33%.\nMinimum target 2580 but will likely go much higher.\n\nDisclaimer: I own IWM and URTY plus many individual small cap stocks that were sold off brutally into October.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 2360 area.\n\nSpecialty Indices:\n\nToday I mention one specialty Index that I think has potential\n\nXBI (Biotech):\nBiotech had a rough time for months now but came back big time breaking a months long downtrend. It hit the 200 day average and is in the middle of retesting that broken downtrendline. XBI could be a buy from here.\n\nDisclaimer: I own LABU (leveraged ETF on XBI). Up 14% as of today.\n\nIf you are only interested in US investments stop here!\n\n\nInternational plays.\n\nFEZ: Eurostoxx had a great comeback like the US Indices and also made new highs after months of sideways action. Minimum target is the 51.5 are or FEZ\n\nDisclaimer: I own FEZ and DB\n\n\nChina (FXI): China is in the middle of a medium-/longterm bottoming phase. It retraced the recent upmove by a little bit more than 61.8%. It could turn any time here. If we really break down to the 37.5 level again it is definitely a buying opportunity.\n\nDisclaimer: I am currently overweight the regular 10% allocation to Asia\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish although choppy because we are in the middle of a bottoming phase (only index I think is in a longterm bottoming phase)\n\n\nSpeculative:\n\nBrazil: I had mentioned last week that Brazil was in dire straights!\n\nHere is the article again:\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/markets-reeling-brazil-deficit-fears-005715131.html\n\nI speculated that like with the Evergrande disaster it might be worth looking at trading opportunities here.\n\nBrazil was sold off with high volume 10-21 and a hammer formed with higher volume 10-22. We were in the middle of retracing the 10% upmove last week. Dropped below the 61.8% retracement but made a double bottom at 29. Friday's candle needs to be be confirmed but I think it has potential. I bought more call options around the $29 area.\n\nExtremely dangerous situation.\n\nDisclaimer: 7-9% of my portfolios are call options on EWZ\n\nOutlook: Possible bottoming phase. Highly speculative.\n\n\n\nOverall positioning:\n\nTime in the market is key and therefore I am almost always 100% invested. This way you get the skeptics out of the way and really don't miss out on opportunities.\n\nHowever timing the market CAN absolutely be done. One can beat the benchmark without ever being out of the market with margin loans, leveraged ETFs and options trading by finding bottoms. My specialty is finding bottoms. The maximum leverage at the lows early October was 3. Now portfolios are at 1.5/1.6 and the goal is to unleverage on the way up to a goal of 1 again when we are closer to a neutral/bearish signal.\n\nThere is a good possibility that a huge rally internationally just started but because one never knows for sure we will continue to unload our positions because we are still overleveraged due to the fact that we anticipated the bottom about 1 month ago and loaded up on stocks then.\n\n\nHappy to discuss as usual. Just post in comment section.\n\nHappy Trades and have a great weekend and trading week!\nGo out there and make money with the tip of your finger!\n\nSee you next week.\nChart-trader",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500\u2032s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.\n*****\n&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.\n*****\n&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%\n*****\n&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,\u201d said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program \u201clater this month.\u201d This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it\u2019s provided since the pandemic took hold.\n*****\n&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today\u2019s meeting, which is why we aren\u2019t seeing a \u2018taper-tantrum 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[W]e\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,\u201d said Oanda\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week\u2019s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/csr94jX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNBnRQj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fohWsiA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/dimSvYo.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/oImlOeJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TnV9F9e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/f2OW6wj.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2psSyZE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5P5LNw4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RrVCnQY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/k3dndoN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/WhuthuY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/XIdGKfq.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TOMORROW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5kgHYBl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jSIcjQk.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VqyLZlv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/INro3Hf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2GtTG34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5EXfeNk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/9QaOqLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rVxlcYW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aG5Jy73.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u4uclmF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-planet-fitness-viacomcbs-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2013 The drug maker\u2019s shares rallied 2.7% in the premarket after it reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter.

The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the \u201csubstantial progress\u201d benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.\n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nSpecifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on \"changes in the economic outlook.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. \n\nNew weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion. This is the next $1 trillion stock IMO. The surge happened due to Wells Fargo raising price target $330, citing the metaverse as a major growth contributor\n* According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) are working out how quickly the rental car company can receive its 100,000 cars delivered\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5\\&amp;amp;reflink=article\\_copyURL\\_share](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share)\n\n* Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for \"green\" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.\n* Britain could speed up a move to make the executives of big techs firm criminally liable for harmful content on their platforms if they do not take action to tackle the problem, Digital Minister Nadine Dorries told lawmakers on Thursday.\n* Google is pursuing a massive cloud-computing contract with the Department of Defense, nearly three years after abandoning a similar bid process in the face of employee protests.\n* Google said on Thursday it plans to allow third party payment systems in South Korea in order to comply with a new law that bans major app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Oppenheimer from $296 to $307 at Outperform.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500\u2032s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.\n*****\n&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.\n*****\n&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%\n*****\n&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,\u201d said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program \u201clater this month.\u201d This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it\u2019s provided since the pandemic took hold.\n*****\n&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today\u2019s meeting, which is why we aren\u2019t seeing a \u2018taper-tantrum 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[W]e\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,\u201d said Oanda\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week\u2019s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/csr94jX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNBnRQj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fohWsiA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/dimSvYo.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/oImlOeJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TnV9F9e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/f2OW6wj.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2psSyZE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5P5LNw4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RrVCnQY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/k3dndoN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/WhuthuY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/XIdGKfq.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TOMORROW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5kgHYBl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jSIcjQk.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VqyLZlv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/INro3Hf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2GtTG34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5EXfeNk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/9QaOqLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rVxlcYW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aG5Jy73.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u4uclmF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-planet-fitness-viacomcbs-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2013 The drug maker\u2019s shares rallied 2.7% in the premarket after it reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter.

S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.\n*****\n&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cCOVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.\n*****\n&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.\n*****\n&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.\n*****\n&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed\u2019s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September\u2019s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.\n*****\n&gt; The other big event for the week will be October\u2019s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September\u2019s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cKey to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WXTnY3e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/xic6dLX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ON $PCG $CRNT $TRVG $AMG $CNA $ALX $SXC $TKR $JELD $LDI $OIS $ENBL $BEN $WTRG $SBT $CHT $AKTS)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/F75otQF.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z21eWxD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aO8d0Fs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mtCexr5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/fj3byrA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tTxuJf8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OLOoH6Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* LCID\n* FSR\n* MVST\n* GEVO\n* BITF\n* XPEV\n* ORGN\n* NIO\n* LRC.X\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-harley-davidson-spotify-trivago-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** \u2013 The motorcycle maker\u2019s shares soared 9.4% in the premarket after the U.S. and the European Union ended a dispute involving steel and aluminum tariffs.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading month of November and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.\n*****\n&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cCOVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.\n*****\n&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.\n*****\n&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.\n*****\n&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed\u2019s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September\u2019s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.\n*****\n&gt; The other big event for the week will be October\u2019s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September\u2019s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cKey to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WXTnY3e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/xic6dLX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ON $PCG $CRNT $TRVG $AMG $CNA $ALX $SXC $TKR $JELD $LDI $OIS $ENBL $BEN $WTRG $SBT $CHT $AKTS)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/F75otQF.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z21eWxD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aO8d0Fs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mtCexr5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/fj3byrA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tTxuJf8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OLOoH6Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* LCID\n* FSR\n* MVST\n* GEVO\n* BITF\n* XPEV\n* ORGN\n* NIO\n* LRC.X\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-harley-davidson-spotify-trivago-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** \u2013 The motorcycle maker\u2019s shares soared 9.4% in the premarket after the U.S. and the European Union ended a dispute involving steel and aluminum tariffs.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500\u2032s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.\n*****\n&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.\n*****\n&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%\n*****\n&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,\u201d said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program \u201clater this month.\u201d This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it\u2019s provided since the pandemic took hold.\n*****\n&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today\u2019s meeting, which is why we aren\u2019t seeing a \u2018taper-tantrum 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[W]e\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,\u201d said Oanda\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week\u2019s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/csr94jX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNBnRQj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fohWsiA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/dimSvYo.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/oImlOeJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TnV9F9e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/f2OW6wj.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2psSyZE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5P5LNw4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RrVCnQY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/k3dndoN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/WhuthuY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/XIdGKfq.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TOMORROW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5kgHYBl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jSIcjQk.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VqyLZlv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/INro3Hf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2GtTG34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5EXfeNk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/9QaOqLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rVxlcYW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aG5Jy73.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u4uclmF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* DKNG\n* SKLZ\n* EVAX\n* ROKU\n* HIMX\n* CRO.X\n* PENN\n* MRNA\n* BTTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-planet-fitness-viacomcbs-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2013 The drug maker\u2019s shares rallied 2.7% in the premarket after it reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading month of November and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.\n*****\n&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cCOVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.\n*****\n&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.\n*****\n&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.\n*****\n&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed\u2019s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September\u2019s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.\n*****\n&gt; The other big event for the week will be October\u2019s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September\u2019s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cKey to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WXTnY3e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/xic6dLX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ON $PCG $CRNT $TRVG $AMG $CNA $ALX $SXC $TKR $JELD $LDI $OIS $ENBL $BEN $WTRG $SBT $CHT $AKTS)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/F75otQF.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z21eWxD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aO8d0Fs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mtCexr5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/fj3byrA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tTxuJf8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OLOoH6Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-harley-davidson-spotify-trivago-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** \u2013 The motorcycle maker\u2019s shares soared 9.4% in the premarket after the U.S. and the European Union ended a dispute involving steel and aluminum tariffs.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading month of November and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.\n*****\n&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cCOVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.\n*****\n&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.\n*****\n&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.\n*****\n&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed\u2019s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September\u2019s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.\n*****\n&gt; The other big event for the week will be October\u2019s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September\u2019s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cKey to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WXTnY3e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/xic6dLX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ON $PCG $CRNT $TRVG $AMG $CNA $ALX $SXC $TKR $JELD $LDI $OIS $ENBL $BEN $WTRG $SBT $CHT $AKTS)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/F75otQF.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z21eWxD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aO8d0Fs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mtCexr5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/fj3byrA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tTxuJf8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OLOoH6Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-harley-davidson-spotify-trivago-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** \u2013 The motorcycle maker\u2019s shares soared 9.4% in the premarket after the U.S. and the European Union ended a dispute involving steel and aluminum tariffs.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500\u2032s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.\n*****\n&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.\n*****\n&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%\n*****\n&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,\u201d said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program \u201clater this month.\u201d This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it\u2019s provided since the pandemic took hold.\n*****\n&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today\u2019s meeting, which is why we aren\u2019t seeing a \u2018taper-tantrum 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[W]e\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,\u201d said Oanda\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week\u2019s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/csr94jX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNBnRQj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fohWsiA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/dimSvYo.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/oImlOeJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TnV9F9e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/f2OW6wj.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2psSyZE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5P5LNw4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RrVCnQY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/k3dndoN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/WhuthuY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/XIdGKfq.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TOMORROW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5kgHYBl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jSIcjQk.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VqyLZlv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/INro3Hf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2GtTG34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5EXfeNk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/9QaOqLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rVxlcYW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aG5Jy73.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u4uclmF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* DKNG\n* SKLZ\n* EVAX\n* ROKU\n* HIMX\n* CRO.X\n* PENN\n* MRNA\n* BTTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-planet-fitness-viacomcbs-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2013 The drug maker\u2019s shares rallied 2.7% in the premarket after it reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter.
