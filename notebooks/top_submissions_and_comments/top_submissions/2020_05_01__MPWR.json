        "selftext": " MPWR stock is too good. MPWR was 10% over all time high, even after yesterday's dip. Their stock price is an anomaly in their sector: $SOXX is up 30% from the march drop, still below february highs. MPRWs larger competitors like Analog devices($ADI), Texas Instruments($TXN), ON semiconductor(ON), and Intel show similar gains. This makes sense: these companies make fundamental manufacturing parts and are sensitive to weak global manufacturing and trade. So what makes MPWR so special? What do they do?\n\n90+% of MPWR's business is the design and sale of DC power supply/power converter chips, the rest is similar derived devices like motor drivers and power sensors. They do not actually manufacture chips themselves, instead contracting to semiconductor foundries. The vast majority of their customers are manufacturers of integrated circuits, mostly in china. This risk profile is common in the segment, but it does leave them exposed to China specific market forces like tariffs, quarantines.\n\nTheir product is so universal to electronic devices that they have a very broad customer base in consumer electronics, industrial automation,  automotive, computing and telecom infrastructure. This has insulated them from some of the cyclic boom-bust patterns of the sector, and historically MPWR's performance is consistently better than the semiconductor ETFs $SOXX.\n\nMPWRs recent history shows some decent management moves. 2018 was a banner year for MPWR. They posted 61% year over year profit growth and their stock price mostly traded sideways for the year. They invested heavily until q4 2019 tanked the sector. They were smart enough to see the contraction coming and were able to eke out 1% profit growth through investment returns and executive pay structure deferments. A better than expected Q1 earnings report helped kick them up over 200$.\n\nSo there's stuff to like. Seems like a good buy in the 150-160 range.nce it comes down, and I think it will come down, here's why:\n\nThe most basic indicators are wrong: P/E ratio is 83. This is 4x higher than typical for the sector, 2x higher than is normal for their closest competitors during the best times. Market analysts are not recommending this stock, it's not being pumped on twitter. MPWR stock looked pretty normal until the second week of april until april 9:\n\nAround April 9-10 MPWR begins to diverge from competitor $POSI after a press release announcing they built a ventilator gets picked up by a few news aggregators. I encourage you to go look at this ventilator:\n\nhttps://www.monolithicpower.com/en/mps-open-source-ventilator\n\nThis is not a remotely viable product. It doesn't even offer practical improvements on the open source ventilator it's based on. It's a medium quality arduino project put together using spare parts, lithium batteries, and MPWR off-the shelf hardware. To me this suggests MPWR has engineers and marketing staff short for paying work.\n\nYou have likely noticed ads/speculation/spam about making money from 5G networks and internet infrastructure. After the ventilator story brought attention to MPWR I expect unfamiliar traders began investigating and found MPWR's marketing materials about these products. MPWR makes almost all of its money from 5 markets:\n\n1) Computer/server gear at roughly 30% of their business\n\n2) Consumer Electronics at 25% of their business\n\n3) Industrial/Commercial Devices 15%\n\n4) Embedded Automotive Devices 15%\n\n5) Infrastructure to consumer scale Telecommunications gear, 15%\n\nNone of their markets are in great shape.\n\nComputer and semiconductor markets are projected to shrink this year, even with some cloud growth.  Unemployment is hurting consumer spending and with that Auto/Consumer electronics spending will shrink.  Telecommunications infrastructure spending could grow this year but broad 5g rollout is scheduled at least a year out. Industrial products might have opportunities with new customers who don't already know who they are, but a locked down sales force and the lack of variety in their product development are bad signs: their sales teams will be less effective globally and I don't expect viable new products from their engineering team.\n\nWithout good new revenue lines they'll need to cut costs. Signs point to them being fucked here. They bought a new US facility shortly before the crash/shelter in place. They purchase their silicon wafers in yearly installments based on sales projections, so inventory costs are locked in. They have an abysmal 1.94 inventory turnover ratio. Maybe this is secretly good: sucking that bad suggests ample room for supply chain improvements.\n\nFinally, their  Q1 earnings which kicked the stock to record highs might not be a good indicator of their health during that quarter. Earnings transcripts describe their sales are long cycle collaborations with oems, with orders taking 8-16 weeks to fulfill. With lead times that long new bookings could have dropped 90% during the end of Q1 and the signal wouldn't show up until next quarter.\n\nAlso: an aside: breathing equipment is a saturated and losing game. Thousands of people are working on solutions, but they won't beat the existing ventilator manufacturers. They are competing with tested, regulatory approved products manufactured with purpose built tooling and process. These companies have already multiplied their throughput with quick purchases of tooling and wiped out the supply of valves, instrumentation and raw materials needed to make that gear. The flattening of infection curves points to less gear being needed than was thought. Look for profits in suppliers of these raw parts.($PH)",

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.
