        "selftext": "Well, I've officially made my first, second, and third million from PRPL (I called it [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7mjl/prpl_more_dd_for_you_autists/) two months ago).   My net liquidity in PRPL as of Friday close is $2,622,131,72.   That, along with the $380k I've taken out, I'm at just over $3M.   At this point, when you take into account all the stupid moves I made when I first found this sub, I'm now playing with house money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Has PRPL Memed Yet?\n\nNo.   It hasn't.   Not yet.   \n\nI'm kind of getting tired of answering this in PMs, so please don't ask me if it is too late to invest.   This hasn't memed and I believe we will be in the $25-27 range easily after earnings just by fundamentals alone (assuming the previous low visibility on the stock).   As visibility increases, I think the valuation multiple increases, and not past fundamentals.   We will see higher if this becomes a no longer under-the-radar stock.\n\nThis isn't a meme yet, and it is no where close.\n\nHow do we know?   Let's look at the ultimate source of truth on the subject:  [Robintrack](https://robintrack.net/symbol/PRPL).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzr2qdg4kne51.png?width=1889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46997d3050986a77c318c7c9e17ceb39cf8b7f91\n\nAs you can see, we've seen a significant influx of Robinhood tards in the last few days, but this isn't memeing, yet.\n\nIf you check the [Robintrack popularity changes](https://robintrack.net/popularity_changes?hoursAgo=168) over the last week, PRPL comes in at #113 most popular in terms of user growth.    That isn't very high at all.   It's surrounded by other stocks you've never heard of.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2376iielne51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ea7b7afb1b7de17dd2f36d4bde3f5f17c0ebf5d\n\nThis is hardly meme worthy yet.   Compare this to KODK:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u62x1fgdmne51.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b16c21e2b56c23818b6a48c97ee0410c12047a\n\nWe should also compare PRPL to two recents meme stocks:  SPCE and DKNG.   As a side note, all three of these stocks came from SPACs BTW, hence the warrants.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ne6lwwnvpne51.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97dba747dc51ec779ef8a8a5640f72257313798\n\nSPCE shot up to about 92,000 Robintards very quickly, which drove the price up.   When the rate of Robintard increases declined and flattened out, the stock dropped.   There are now 150k Robintards holding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xndxysxpne51.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4db5e52718775e5b30ffe74d59784f34395600c\n\nDKNG shot up to about 100,000 Robintards investing on the meme run up, and still has about 120k still in.  The meme drop off is less pronounced on DKNG because, unlike SPCE, they have this thing called \"Revenue\".\n\nKODK, SPCE, and DKNG all had run ups to about 100k Robintards driving the meme up in price way over fundamentals.   PRPL only has 6,600 Robintards, and the current price is fully supported by fundamentals (see some of my previous posts and u/dhsmatt2's previous posts if you want support on that statement).\n\nSo, no, it isn't a meme.   Keep tabs on this though as Robintard entry could definitely cause this to meme up (and we may very well be in the early stages of this right now).   Buy calls now and sell when we start getting close to 100k Robintards.\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nI think u/dhsmatt2 did a pretty good job [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0zaqh/prpl_nurples_why_purple_valuation_just_might_make/?sort=new).   My only two comments are:  1)  I think his revenue estimate is low (mine:  $244m, his $225M), and 2)  the warrant liability accrual won't be recurring at the same level (we will see one big bang this quarter and then a wimper going forward until the warrants are gone--so his forward EPS estimate should be higher on his math).\n\nMy revenue estimates:\n\n||Q2 Total|June|May|April|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)|*205.0*|*80.0*|**71.0**|**54.0**|\n|Wholesale Partner|*39.0*|*19.0*|**17.3**|*2.7*|\n||||||\n|Total|*244.0 M*|*99.0*|**88.3**|*56.7*|\n\nThe bold numbers are known for sure as they were disclosed.   The italicized are my estimates.\n\nI'm putting June DTC as an acceleration over May because of the following:\n\n1. The website still showed significant delays in delivery, which means they were still selling every mattress they make.\n2. Extra manufacturing capacity came online at the beginning of June.\n3. Purple discontinued its lower end models, which would cause a mix shift up in revenue per unit when selling at capacity.\n\nI may be underestimating this as well.\n\nI placed wholesale where it was at because it is still recovering and Joe Megibow [said in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=youtu.be) that they were almost flat of wholesale year over year at this point.\n\n# Valuations\n\nI'm copying this [from a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hig038/i_bought_six_prpl_mattresses_today_you_should_buy/), even though the data is slightly dated now after TPX and SNBR had their releases.\n\n**Enterprice Value / Revenue**\n\n|Ticker|As of 6/28/20|2020 Q1|2019 Q4|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PRPL|2.01|2.52|3.94|3.61|3.73|3.09|\n|TPX|1.71|4.84|7.39|7.34|8.07|6.88|\n|SNBR|0.98|2.36|4.40|3.79|4.97|3.78|\n|CSPR|0.53|0.91|||||\n\nBased upon the chart, I don't see a 2x multiple on revenue as unreasonable at all for PRPL, and arguably, it should be higher due to the acceleration in growth rate.\n\nThe Q2 revenue pattern will continue into Q3 and beyond (they are still backed up on delivery on several products).   Additionally, they will be bringing substantial capacity online in the next year to support sales.   I see PRPL producing $800M-$1,200M in revenue over the next year as we see continued capacity growth, shift into higher end mattresses, and continued expansion on both DTC and wholesale doors.\n\nClearly, it is easy to justify the $1.32B valuation as of close Friday, and arguably, much higher.\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kza0j31utne51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcb053f5300205be309cdf19b4fbc23a7a6df276\n\nA bunch of warrants and call debit spreads.  \n\n# Recommendations\n\nI don't have any recommendations.   Go talk to your investment advisor as this isn't investment advice.   What am I looking at right now?   Debit spreads.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hv4gez1une51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8bdb7c9ecd0ae6730e95732434687b2ecc56a11\n\nIf you took the ask, you can pick up a 20/22.5c debit spread for only $1.70.   It pays out $2.50 as long as the stock stays above $22.50 after earnings (likelihood is extremely high as the stock is currently at $24.37).\n\nFor those of you who are asking what to do or wondering if it is too late to make money:   that is an example conservative position to take even if you think the stock will be flat from here on out till earnings (it won't be).\n\nMy bet is that it continues to grow each day on a run up.   I'll be watching Robintrack very closely on the run up.    My plan is to hold through earnings, unless we meme up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PRPL GANG FTW!!!",

        "selftext": "# tl;dr - Earnings is gonna be lit!\n\n[PRPL earnings is tomorrow, 8/13, after hours](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-to-Report-Second-Quarter-2020-Results-on-August-13-2020/default.aspx).   Any other date is wrong.  Robinhood is wrong (why are you using Robinhood still!?!).\n\nI'm going to take you through my earnings projections and reasoning as well the things to look for in the earnings release and the call that could make this moon even further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Earnings Estimates\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3qad4gb9ng51.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a88656a9867d0e40710736f61974a22b5f4a631\n\nI'm calling $244M Net Revenue with $39.75M in Net Income, which would be $0.75 Diluted EPS.  I'll walk you through how I got here\n\n# Total Net Revenue\n\nI make the assumption that Purple is still selling every mattress it can make (since that is what they said for April and May) and that this continued into June because the website was still delayed 7-14 days across all mattresses at the end of June.\n\n**May Revenue and April DTC:**  The numbers in purple were provided by Purple [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx) and [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-Business-Update-Ahead-of-Participation-in-Oppenheimer-20th-Annual-Consumer-Growth-Conference/default.aspx).  \n\n**April Wholesale:**  My estimate of $2.7M for Wholesale sales in April comes from this statement from the Q1 earnings release:  \" *While wholesale sales were down 42.7% in April year-over-year, weekly wholesale orders have started to increase on a sequential basis.* \"  I divided Q2 2019's wholesale sales evenly between months and then went down 42.7%.\n\n**June DTC:**  This is my estimate based upon the fact that another Mattress Max machine went online June 1, thus increasing capacity, and the low end model was discontinued (raising revenue per unit).\n\n**June Wholesale:**  [Joe Megibow stated at Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=emb_logo) on 7/30 that wholesale had returned to almost flat growth.  I'm going to assume he meant for the quarter, so I plugged the number here to finish out the quarter at $39.0M, just under $39.3M from a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenue Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/notxd6hhbng51.png?width=384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa0453414f467aa6c5bf72ce8a8046c0ae6e62a5\n\nMy estimate of $244M comes in way over the high, let alone the consensus.   PRPL has effectively already disclosed \\~$145M for April/May, so these expectations are way off.  I'm more right than they are.\n\n# Gross Margins\n\nI used my estimates for Q3/Q4 2019 to guide margins in April/May as there were some one time events that occurred in Q1 depressing margins.   June has higher margin because of the shift away from the low end model (which is priced substantially lower than the high end model).   Higher priced models were given manufacturing priority.\n\n# Operating Expenses\n\n**Marketing and Sales**\n\nJoe mentioned in the [Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=emb_logo) video that they were able to scale sales at a constant CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).   There's three ways of interpreting this:\n\n1. Overall customer acquisition cost was constant with previous quarters (assume $36M total, not $93.2M), which means you need to add another $57M to bottom line profit and $1.08 to EPS, or\n2. Customer Acquisition Costs on a unit basis were constant, which means I'm still overstating total marketing expense and understating EPS massively, or\n3. Customer Acquisition Costs on a revenue basis were constant, which is the most conservative approach and the one I took for my estimate.\n\nI straightlined the 2.2 ratio of DTC sales to Marketing costs from Q1.   I am undoubtably too high in my expense estimate here as PRPL saw marketing efficiencies and favorable revenue shifts during the quarter.  So, $93.2M\n\n**General and Administrative**\n\nA Purple HR rep [posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6691037138018017280/) about hiring 330 people in the quarter.   I'm going to assume that was relative to the pre-COVID furloughs, so I had June at that proportional amount to previous employees and adjusted April and May for furloughs and returns from furlough.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nI added just a little here and straight lined it.\n\n# Other Expenses\n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nStraightlined from previous quarters, although they may have tapped ABL lines and so forth, so this could be under.\n\n**One Time and Other**\n\nUnpredictable by nature.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI'm making some assumptions here.   \n\n1. We know that the secondary offering event during Q2 from the Pearce brothers triggered the clause for the loan warrants (NOT the PRPLW warrants) to lower the strike price to $0.\n2. I can't think of a logical reason why the warrant holders wouldn't exercise at this point.\n3. Therefore there is no longer a warrant liability where the company may need to repurchase warrants back.\n4. The liability accrual of $7.989M needs to be reversed out for a gain.\n\nThis sucker is worth about $0.15 EPS on its own.\n\n# Earnings (EPS)\n\nI project $39.75M or $0.75 Diluted EPS (53M shares).  How does this hold up to the analysts?\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2i1dvk6hng51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27e63f7934d85393e1f7b87bf2e2066c28047202\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psu5rajfhng51.png?width=1359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0612d43777c644789b14f8c5decbe36f41925f5e\n\nThese losers are way under.   Now you know why I am so optimistic about earnings.\n\nKeep in mind, these analysts are still giving $28-$30 price targets.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What to Watch For During Earnings (aka Reasons Why This Moons More)\n\nAnalysts, Institutionals, and everyone else who uses math for investing is going to be listening for the following:\n\n* Margin Growth\n* Warrant Liability Accrual\n* Capacity Expansion Rate\n* CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)\n* New Product Categories\n* Cashless Exercise of PRPLW warrants\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Margin Growth**\n\nThis factor is HUGE.  If PRPL guides to higher margins due to better sales mix and continued DTC shift, then every analyst and investor is going to tweak their models up in a big way.   Thus far, management has been relatively cautious about this fortuitous shift to DTC continuing.   [If web traffic is any indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i7gjsn/prpl_q2_revenue_forecast_using_web_traffic/), it will, but we need management to tell us that.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI could be dead wrong on my assumptions above on this one.   If it stays, there will be questions about it due to the drop in exercise price.   It does impact GAAP earnings (although it shouldn't--stupid accountants).\n\n**Capacity Expansion Rate**\n\nThis is a BIG one as well.   As PRPL has been famously capacity constrained: their rate of manufacturing capacity expansion is their growth rate over the next year.  PRPL discontinued expansion at the beginning of COVID and then re-accelerated it to a faster pace than pre-COVID by hurrying the machines in-process out to the floor.   They also signed their [manufacturing space deal](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Expands-U.S.-Manufacturing-with-a-New-Facility-in-Georgia/default.aspx) which has nearly doubled manufacturing space a quarter early.   The REAL question is when the machines will start rolling out.   Previous guidance was end of the year at best.   If we get anything sooner than that, we are going to ratchet up.\n\n**CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)**\n\nSince DTC is the new game in town, we are all going to want to understand exactly where marketing expenses were this quarter and, more importantly, where management thinks they are going.   The magic words to listen for are \"marketing efficiencies\".   Those words means the stock goes up.  This is the next biggest line item on the P&amp;L besides revenue and cost of goods sold.\n\n**New Product Categories**\n\nWe [heard the VP of Brand](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-authentic-influence-31157510/episode/purple-vp-of-brand-burke-morley-67762598/) from Purple give us some touchy-feely vision of where the company is headed and that mattresses was just the revenue generating base to empower this.   I'm hoping we hear more about this.    This is what differentiated Amazon from Barnes and Noble:  Amazon's vision was more than just books.   Purple sees itself as more than just mattresses.   Hopefully we get some announced action behind that vision.   This multiplies the stock.\n\n**Cashless Exercise of PRPLW Warrants**\n\nI doubt this will be answered, even if the question is asked.   I bet they wait until the 20 out of 30 days is up and they deliver notice.   We could be pleasantly surprised.   If management informs us that they will opt for cashless exercise of the warrants, this is anti-dilutive to EPS.   It will reduce the number of outstanding shares and automatically cause an adjustment up in the stock price (remember kids, some people use math when investing).   I'm hopeful, but not expecting it.   The amount of the adjustment depends on the current price of the stock.    Also, I fully expect PRPL management to use their cashless exercise option at the end of the 20 out of 30 days as they are already spitting cash.\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tho65crvkng51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6241ff5e8b26744f9d7119ddef7da86f163c741d\n\nI'm not just holding, I added.\n\nPRPLW Warrants:  391,280\n\nPRPL Call Debit Spreads:   17.5c/25c 8/21 x90, 20c/25c 8/21 x247\n\nAlso, I bought some CSPR 7.5p 8/21 x200 for fun because I think that sucker is going to get shamed back down to $6 after a real mattress company shows what it can do.",

About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.\n\nTesla passed Johnson &amp; Johnson \ufffc (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&amp;P 500 index worth more, including Visa \ufffc (V) at $447 billon and Apple \ufffc (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.\n\nThere is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.\n\nIt\u2019s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It\u2019s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla\u2019s own CEO Elon Musk.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly four times International Business Machines \ufffc\u2019 (IBM) market cap.\n\nYou could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store\u2014or just buy Dollar General \ufffc (DG) and Dollar Tree \ufffc (DLTR).\n\nIt\u2019s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.\n\nWith $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA\u2019s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.\n\nIf you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla\u2019s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "Hey gang, just wanted to provide a quick update on whats happening in Silver.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*DD ALERT\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n My Positions:\n\nSLV 9/18 24.5C - 79\n\nSLV 9/30 26C - 30\n\nSLV 12/31 27C - 25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Required Prerequisite Reading\\*\\*\\* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5m4ri/real\\_talk\\_slv/g0qcer1?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5m4ri/real_talk_slv/g0qcer1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHappy Sunday ladies, get ready for Futures Open in 7hrs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Trump turned the Money printer on yesterday, again.  $400/wk (states have to pickup 25% of it) - You don't have to pay rent/mortgage, electricity bills, or student loans through EOY.  Also, he enacted a payroll tax cut that will be come a grant IF he becomes re-elected. So inflation will continue to rise, oh and the Fed is capping interest rates on bonds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Metals compete DIRECTLY with REAL (inflation adjusted) interest rates. As a foundational bedrock investment of  Pensions, Mutual Funds, and general portfolios - people have traditionally held long term bonds.  Metals are a 0% thing, you can't eat them and they are basically a pet rock - but they are stable at 0% forever, as metals were the ORIGINAL money.  If you take the current bond rate, and subtract the inflation rate, you get -1.1%.  This is causing MASSIVE moves in the market as people leave bonds and crowd into metals, as 0% beats the hell out of negative REAL rates.  Currently Gold is at 2100, if we go to -2% REAL rates, Gold will be 2500. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Learn about Rehypothecation here ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:\\~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.)).  For obvious reasons, this is why housing blew up in 2008.  The exact same thing is happening in Silver, but inversely.  Silver has been abused for so long, but it REALLY started in 2011. The \"classic\" (meaning the mined ratio, or the ratio at which they pull this shit out of the ground) is around 16:1.  In 2005, the ratio was 60:1.  On Friday's close, the Silver/Gold ratio was 79:1.  Silver has a LONG way to catch-up.  At CURRENT levels, Silver SHOULD be (assuming a 60:1 ratio) \\~ 35ish.  So when you look at the fact that Silver has been abused for so long that its undervalued, coupled with the Massive run on metals due to negative REAL rates, Silver has massive upside. The amount of fund inflows into Silver ETF's is another leg up on silver as well - they eventually are going to have to officially re-value silver to reflect fund inflows and sentiment.  Who knows what the new Silver/Gold ratio could end up as...but I'm betting its a LOT lower than 60:1. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short, and the world blew up in their face.  HSBC lost $200M in a single day, and closed their industrial metals business around 6 weeks ago ( [https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html) ).  Soctiabank also closed down its metals trading desk around 4 months ago ( [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&amp;text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&amp;text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.) )  This means the ONLY one left is JPM, and they are still trying to fight us, but are losing and continuing to wind down shorts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4b) The $1.5 drop we saw Thursday night was exactly this - banks reloading shorts to try and fight us, but there is a big difference. An ALL TIME RECORD amount of shorts were opened on the Comex on Thursday, around 350k contracts....a RECORD amount...and all it did was $1.50 in damage....so that should tell you where sentiment and price action is.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&amp;t=1s) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Silver is about to go hyperbolic and nothing is in it's way.  The fed is printing money (driving inflation), people are already crowding metals, banks are unwinding their short positions (or closing their metals trading desk all together), and there are HISTORIC inflows into Silver - which will eventually cause a revaluation to the upside.  I'm an EE and I love Technical Analysis, but this is 100% fundamental driven. \n\nA retired energy trader once told me \"Fundamentals will tell you why something is happening, TA will tell you when\".  TA is broken on metals right now and all its doing is making algos and morons try to load shorts.  Multinational global banks are literally leaving the idea of shorting metals, so maybe follow suit?  These are some of the smartest people on earth and I hate bankers, but they aren't dumb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a great week.",

        "selftext": "Ok, so you know how Apple has been mooning on news of the iPhone 12, and ARM MacBooks, which has totally screwed over INTC and made TSM and other suppliers to AAPL moon?\n\n(Here's the background info in case you missed the news [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY))\n\nApple was actually approached by Softbank to buy ARM but they couldn't due to ARM licensing stuff out to competitors as well, and Apple obviously has a very private philosophy too so that wouldn't work. But, they will continue to use chipsets based on ARM's architecture for the future macbooks/iphones as well ([https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/](https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/)). But if you just follow the money, and try to find out who actually will OWN ARM, the offer has come from none other than Nvidia, and the deal to buy ARM is all but confirmed. (seeck ingalpha.com/article/4370499-chippening-part-2-nvidia-reaches-for-outstretched-arm). And I'm sure that most of you are aware of how AAPL is trying to expand its reach into countries like India for the first time offering first-party stores and an online store, etc. This will only increase their sales numbers, and Apple will only get more bullet proof from hereon. The real story here, is in NVDA.\n\nWhen they do end up buying ARM, the merger will either be seen as A.) a value destroying buy that wasn't worth it or B.) A merger of epic proportions that inserts Nvidia into the mobile and CPU market \"Apple recently indicated it would change their use of Intel chips in Mac computers to custom made ARM-based chips. This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets.\n\nNVIDIA is not currently a major competitor in the smartphone and tablet business, so acquiring ARM would expand it into new realms where ARM happens to dominate. NVIDIA did previously attempt to compete in this business, but its Tegra chips never got much market share.\"\n\nMost of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&amp;D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer. Their Cash per share has grown insanely :\n\nCash Per Share ratio\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3wz4otn79j51.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501e51a371f0d4ab402a8500a03e14b6e31f86d3\n\nAnd they have low long term debt that has barely increased, but their assets have remarkably increased, which means a low lt debt/asset ratio, just showing you how much of a powerhouse NVDA is.\n\nLT debt/total assets\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0hg0zqmo79j51.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2862927faff7933cf9600ae20f76455de0a47ee\n\nNot only that, but along with decreasing/flatlining long term debt, they have a negative cash conversion cycle, which greatly reduces opex. Financially, this is only the beginning of their buildup. Aside from just solid financials for such a revolutionary company, they have revolutionary products. Their cloud services and acquisition of Mellanox will only expand their bases. Nvidia has a vision, and it may be very far-out and hard to accomplish or it may be the most genius thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure how long this'll take to work itself out, but I wouldn't fear buying March 2021 740 calls.",

        "selftext": "NFA (Not Financial Advice)\n\nHere's another round of some fairly comprehensive fundamental DD on a stock I believe is well positioned to provide many tendies going forward. If you hate reading, but want to spend your parent's inheritance on something that is somewhat defensible / not retarded, skip to the bottom for the bolded call.\n\n**I. The Company - CrowdStrike Holdings**\n\nIntroducing CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). Founded in 2011 by George Kurtz a former EVP @ McAfee &amp; 2 other guys (including a Russian hacking genius), the Company is a cloud native endpoint security provider. Google's venture capital arm initially put in $100mm into the Company &amp; while private, took in funding from a couple big names in the VC/PE space then went public in mid-2019. What the fuck does cloud native endpoint security mean? In an era where everything is shifting to the 'cloud' &amp; more folks work from home, this Company focuses on developing/implementing/selling cloud-based software that provides security to all 'endpoint' devices (laptops, servers, phones, tablets, etc.). Do I need to say more on how big this market opportunity is? Should be common sense at this point. To put some numbers to this - in June 2020, the endpoint security market was estimated to be \\~$8Bn total, &amp; adding up the other verticals CRWD participates in, the TAM (Total Addressable Market) of their line of products totals \\~$27Bn \\[9\\], though there are estimates that this is much higher. \n\nSo far, CRWD's products protect 49% of the Fortune 100's Company's endpoint devices \\[9\\], but before I go into more detail on what differentiates CrowdStrike from its competitors, I want to highlight a couple recent themes that are emerging which formed the pillars to my investment thesis.\n\n**II. CIO Investment Spending Surveys as of August 2020**\n\nAt the beginning &amp; midpoint of each year, the big investment banks conduct surveys from CIOs of major corporations to gain insight into where they intend to invest going forward. I have the most recent Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, &amp; Stifel surveys summarized here, which became publicized this month (8/2020)\n\n\\- JPM surveys 130 CIOs responsible for \\~$88Bn in annual enterprise IT spending, average IT budget of \\~$675mm per firm\n\n\\- GS compiles the results &amp; tracks an \"IT Spending Index\"; the latest results? IT Spending Index fell to 21.5 from 60.5 in 12/2019, which is the lowest level since GS began the index tracking in 2002\n\n\\- IT budgets set to shrink by \\~5%, removing the largest IT budgets (Companies with budgets &gt;$1Bn), set to shrink by \\~7% this year (JPM)\n\nSo, IT budgets are overall shrinking &amp; expected to be down. Let's get to the good shit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Question to CIOs: Please describe the categories of project that will be impacted positively\\/negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic &amp; global economic recession](https://preview.redd.it/mdbqee86i9j51.jpg?width=485&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=399ea22eb349e284f06ac8902efe53ee4e6bf691)\n\n\\- 79% of CIOs believe COVID is acting as a forcing function to make them digitally transform &amp; move to the public Cloud even faster than they had planned with 36% of them increasing their spend in these areas for 2020 &amp; beyond (JPM)\n\n\\- Security remains the top spending priority, followed up with Collaboration Applications, Business Intelligence/Analytics, Workflow Automation &amp; Public Cloud (GS)\n\n\\- Within Security, Identity, Firewall, &amp; Endpoint are top priorities - 36% of CIOs polled expect Security spending to accelerate in 2020. Caveat: Is down compared to 10-year average of 38% (GS)\n\n\\- Endpoint screened at #3, down from #1 for the first time since June 2016 - believe drop in ranking is temporary as shift in spending priorities to ensure seamless provisioning/de-provisioning of user rights accesses &amp; secured traffic workflow to corporate network for WFH. This also may be due to the significant decline in PC spending from the 12/2019 survey (21% expected to increase PC spending vs. 33% prior) - more on this below (GS)\n\n\\- Percentage of survey respondents that mentioned 'endpoint security' as a highly prioritized area of security investment expanded from 42.4% in the 1Q'20 VAR survey to 81.3% in the 2Q'20 VAR survey (Stifel)\n\n**III. WTF is Endpoint Security &amp; Comparable Products from a Computer Autist**\n\nSince I'm fairly new to what the fuck \"cybersecurity\" is, I'm assuming most of you autists are as well. Here are my findings on 3 major components of cybersecurity - Identity, Firewall &amp; Endpoint.\n\nThink of Identity/Firewall as basically the Security implementations a Company deploys that occur 'outside' of your Company issued device. Basically, it is all the encryption &amp; other shit that secures your user ID/password &amp; engages in the web traffic, etc. you go through. \n\nEndpoint on the other hand is basically 2 parts. 1st part is akin to your Anti-Virus bloatware shit that comes pre-installed on most retail laptops, etc. &amp; runs in the background of your device constantly monitoring everything going on to make sure some weird file with an embedded virus ends up on your device. I might get shit from the real cybersecurity folks on this, but I'm not an IT guy - I'm the user of these devices, I'm the one fucking paying you. Your 'endpoint' security thing is software that replaces my anti-virus, so I see it as similar. Deal with it fucking nerds. \n\nThe 2nd part is what sets it apart from traditional AV software - which is some magical, computer geek shit that monitors 'network' activity that occurs as your device sends information out of your device &amp; receives information from the web, usb devices, or whatever. This is where the 'Cloud' &amp; 'AI' stuff occurs - a bit more on this later. \n\nPicture this: if you've ever worked on a Company issued device in the past, there's one thing that always sticks out. The AV is fucking annoying - when working with large excel files/presentations, basically anything outside of web surfing/email, there is a noticeable lag that really pisses you off, especially when you're in time-crunch situations &amp; need to get work done quickly. On your personal devices, you can just pause the scans or whatever, but on Company issued devices you'll get random lag spikes &amp; from my personal experience it is usually due to the security bloatware that you cannot uninstall. \n\nSo what differentiates CRWD? There are a bunch of benchmarks full of computer-geek jargon but overall, the top products block \\~99% of threats &amp; deal with them in their own manners that are OK to me. So what do I want to focus on, &amp; what matters to me as a non-IT employee is efficiency. So, I've done some research into CRWD's claim that they provide a 'light-weight' solution to all this. I don't give a fuck about how the Samsung Galaxy Note has a pen &amp; all those gimmicks if it isn't executed well. I like my iPhone not because it can do all those weird things Androids can do, I like it b/c out of all the simplistic things I want a phone to do, it does it well, does it without lag, &amp; does it predictably. CRWD seems to aim for this type of experience for the end user while providing top of the line cybersecurity. \n\nThe market leaders in the endpoint security space based on market share as of July 2019 are: Symantec (16%), Trend Micro (12%), McAfee (12%) &amp; a few steps down is Crowdstrike (5%) \\[6\\]. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As of July 2019](https://preview.redd.it/tbatexuog9j51.jpg?width=344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ea99f254dc8f92597b75a3a84df4bfebf64fd49)\n\nSo based on these comps, I want to try to proxy for which of the companies above offer an Endpoint Protection product that fits me, the most likely average user.\n\nI'm going to proxy the 'load' of each Company's product, proxied by RAM Usage:\n\n\\- Symantec: 25MB of RAM, takes up \\~450MB of hard drive \\[1\\]\n\n\\- McAfee: Claims 75MB of RAM, complaints of 150-200MB+ \\[2\\]\n\n\\- Trend Micro: Requirements of &gt;256MB of RAM, install size of \\~350MB \\[3\\]. They have all these configurations on how to reduce CPU usage but I'm going to ignore that as I want to compare standard installs. Google is full of complaints on how much memory usage other Trend Micro products utilize that bogs down computer performance\n\n\\- **CrowdStrike: \\~25MB of your hard drive &amp; uses 2MB of RAM; also consumes 4-6MB of bandwidth/day \\[4\\]** \n\nClearly the winning solution is CrowdStrike. With the previously mentioned finding that there will be a decline of PC buying as a CIO priority, older systems will be utilized for a bit longer than usual going forward. However, the size &amp; complexity of software will continue to demand more &amp; more computing power, paving the path for CRWD implementation as one of the easiest ways for an organization to improve efficiency while retaining the most advanced modern form of cybersecurity - a tailwind many might be overlooking, &amp; something the Sales teams at CRWD are undoubtedly pushing. \n\n**IV. What else differentiates CrowdStrike &amp; Total Addressable Market Continued**\n\nSo we've gone over the market opportunity size &amp; why CRWD's main product, Endpoint Security (called Falcon Prevent) would be the preferred choice for regular autistic users like myself, but couple other things:\n\n\\- On Gartner.com - which reviews &amp; compiles customer experiences of cybersecurity products, CRWD is the most highly rated &amp; has one of the leading \"would recommend\" %s of 98% \\[5\\]  \n\n\\- While every fucking Company in the Tech space likes to throw around the term \"AI\" &amp; \"Cloud\", these guys are legit in their claims. The reason their Endpoint Security is so lightweight is because it is Cloud-based &amp; is AI-based in its architecture. Meaning - for every incremental customer added, the Endpoint Security collects more data &amp; gets smarter. \n\nI'll get into how the Company scales financially later, but it's important to note that the product exhibits similar characteristics. Their product, along with its revenues, will scale with each additional customer added.\n\nCRWD's host of products are offered in 10 distinct modules across endpoint security, security &amp; operations, &amp; threat intelligence:\n\n\\- Endpoint Security: Falcon Prevent (Nextgen AV - AI-based), Falcon Insight (Endpoint Detection &amp; Response), &amp; USB Device Control\n\n\\- Security &amp; Operations: Falcon Overwatch (Prov. customers with access to dedicated experts - managed threat hunting solution), Falcon Discover (gives deep visibility into endpoints on a customer's network), Falcon Spotlight (IDs unpatched vulnerabilities in real time running on endpoints), Falcon Complete (Comprehensive managed solution)  \n\\- Threat Intelligence: Falcon X (Leading threat research &amp; intelligence), Falcon Search Engine, Falcon Sandbox.   \n\\- Crowdstrike Store: Provides 3rd party app developers the ability to leverage CRWD's cloud native architecture &amp; lightweight agent to create custom 3rd party apps\n\nAll said, CRWD charges $6.99 - $17.99 per endpoint, per month.\n\nIn the U.S., it's estimated that there are \\~1.2 endpoints per employee at every company in the US with &gt;100 employees. At the aforementioned pricing, this represents potential revenues per year of $8.2Bn - $21.1Bn \\[6\\]. Remember this is the U.S. only - in 2019, CRWD generated 23% of its revenues outside of the U.S., and as of the most recent quarter, this came in at 27%. Globally, Morgan Stanley predicts the IT security spending market to reach $128Bn; while currently, 24% of IT security spend is spent on Endpoint Security. Putting these 2 together implies a TAM of \\~$31Bn. \\[8\\] All of these calcs from extremely credible sources seem to imply that management's use of IDC's estimate that CRWD's 2020E TAM of $8Bn is an extremely conservative estimate (also something to note: what goes in each Company's investor presentations is highly scrutinized by internal legal counsel, so they play it as safe as they can - unless you're Elon Musk).\n\n**V. Financials** \n\nCRWD likes to market themselves to the investor community as the category-defining cloud platform for Security. CRM Cloud is dominated by SalesForce, Service Management by ServiceNow, HR by Workday, &amp; Security by CRWD. So from the angle of a SaaS investment opportunity, the main things to focus on are subscription customers, ARR (annual recurring revenue) &amp; billings plus the corresponding growth rates in each of the categories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s64sdnjqi9j51.jpg?width=895&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd78748412a99433eaecb54229b89c42a2c2e8af\n\nCRWD as of the most recent quarter has 6,261 customers which grew by +105% YoY, adding +830 from the previous quarter. ARR came in at $686mm which grew +88% YoY. Billings came in at $231mm, representing +90% YoY growth. \n\nThis is cool &amp; all, but let's look at some ratios, &amp; how they compare relatively to other SaaS peers.\n\nLTV (Lifetime Value) to CAC (Customer Acquisition Costs) ratio -&gt; higher ratio means Company is acquiring new customers at higher levels of profitability &amp; S&amp;M investments will translate to higher profitability over time:\n\nCRWD is in the top 5 out of 34 SaaS companies with a LTV:CAC of 5.8x as of the most recent quarter vs. a 2.6x Median across SaaS companies \\[6\\]\\[7\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CRWD as of MRQ - Remainder as of 7\\/2019](https://preview.redd.it/doj9bjpxg9j51.jpg?width=535&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb0c696c6d5772caf2b0e6446ccfc4296b8dfc86)\n\nAnother interesting feature is they went EBITDA positive for the 2nd quarter in a row - a first in the Company's history; also want to add their EBITDA went bigly positive, growing by +270% QoQ from barely eeking out EBITDA of $0.3mm a quarter ago. \n\nWhat about sales efficiency? This is important as we want to assess the variable costs associated with generating incremental ARR &amp; can be defined as the LTM S&amp;M Expense / New ARR. As of the most recent quarter, CRWD clocks in a ratio of 0.9x, &amp; is in the top 10 out of the 34 SaaS comparables \\[6\\]\\[7\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CRWD as of MRQ - Remainder as of 7\\/2019](https://preview.redd.it/qcvf2hk3h9j51.jpg?width=532&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4b83a2bcadc9d7bd7e6cb8a1118834ec292d9f)\n\n**Final Remarks - Valuation / Is Everything Priced In? &amp; Quick Management Overview**\n\nSo far we've covered the scope &amp; size of the Cybersecurity market, gone over some reasons why CRWD is differentiated, &amp; have shown that their unit economics / business model is being executed at the highest levels. How does all this translate into a stock price?\n\nLet's start with market share. Goldman estimates that these guys crank out \\~$780mm of Revenues this year, &amp; based on Management's conservative view of TAM totaling \\~$27Bn this year \\[9\\], that shakes out to a *paltry 3% market share* for CRWD. Other analysts (JPM, Stifel) are pegging Rev. to this \\~$770-$780mm mark, &amp; based on everything said about the Company, their recent performance, all of these estimates seem to be *'playing it safe'* which should result in the Company positioned to 'beat' earnings expectations going forward. If you've done this autistic earnings play shit for long enough, you'll learn quickly that this is how the game is played; especially for high growth companies. \n\nAll of this put together, I am **modeling a near/medium-term share price target of $120 - $135 per Share**. This represents a 21x - 24x EV/Sales multiple on \\~$1.3Bn of Sales, which corresponds to a \\~4.8% market share. Other SaaS companies like CRM, SHOP, NOW &amp; WDAY trade at an average EV/2021E Sales of 17.4x, with 3-year Rev. CAGRs of \\~28%. More importantly, SHOP trades at 33x EV/2021E Sales &amp; has a 3-year Rev. CAGR of 44% &amp; on the low end is CRM (more mature now) which trades at 9.6x EV/Sales with a 21% 3-year Rev. CAGR. The unit economics &amp; current macro backdrop suggests CRWD should be at least a 30% Rev. CAGR company, which warrants the \\~20x EV/Sales price target. \n\nMore on the Rev figures: \\~$1.3Bn of Rev. shakes out to Subscription Customers totaling \\~11,800 based on their most recent ARR/Subscription Customer of \\~$110k (which is below their '19 &amp; '20 figures). While this may seem like some insane figure to reach given their most recent quarter had total subscription customers of 6,261, it is easy to make sense of if you think about how at the end of 2019, they had total subscription customers of 2,516 - so from then to now they've grown by \\~2.6x! I will re-evaluate my positions if the stock breaches $140/Share. As a side note: Salesforce went from 10.5% market share in 2008 to 16.4% in 2009, their biggest jump in Company history. These SaaS companies really start to accelerate when shit hits the fan, CRWD is well positioned to mimic this phenomenon. \n\nQuick management overview: \n\nGeorge Kurtz is their CEO - has \\~30% of total Class B shares, controls \\~23% of CRWD's voting power. Dude is 49 years old, been doing cybersecurity for nearly 30 years, &amp; prior to CRWD was the worldwide CTO of McAfee. He later resigned from McAfee (where he was undoubtedly probably getting paid millions with a good shot at becoming CEO) to found CRWD with Dmitri Alperovitch &amp; Gregg Marston. There are stories about what prompted the move, &amp; one he usually talks about is how while at McAfee &amp; on an international flight, he saw one of the passengers seated next to him boot up his laptop &amp; wait 15 minutes for the McAfee AV software to load up to begin working. This story jives with my previous observation on the light-weightedness of CRWD's product vs. competitors. Anyway, this dude is definitely in line to produce as many tendies as possible along with us as he has a million shares that vest in 48 equal monthly installments that began on 11/2018 &amp; another 350k shares that vest over 24 equal monthly installments beginning in 11/2022. On top of this, he has $131mm / 2mm additional RSUs that vest in 16 equal *quarterly* installments which began on 12/2018 - meaning this huge chunk of RSUs are starting to hit their stride this year, &amp; you know Kurtz is definitely going to do what it takes to maximize the value of this. \\[10\\]\n\n\\[1\\] [https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=7101aafb-4290-4945-af3a-dd1e79f73659&amp;CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&amp;tab=digestviewer](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=7101aafb-4290-4945-af3a-dd1e79f73659&amp;CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&amp;tab=digestviewer)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://community.mcafee.com/t5/Endpoint-Security-ENS/ENS-10-6-10-5-4-McShield-Average-Memory-Usage/td-p/596633](https://community.mcafee.com/t5/Endpoint-Security-ENS/ENS-10-6-10-5-4-McShield-Average-Memory-Usage/td-p/596633)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://www.ingrammicro.com/healthcare/TrendMicro\\_enterprise-security-endpoints.pdf](http://www.ingrammicro.com/healthcare/TrendMicro_enterprise-security-endpoints.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/WhitepaperGuidetoAVReplacement.pdf](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/WhitepaperGuidetoAVReplacement.pdf)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-protection-platforms/vendor/crowdstrike/product/falcon/alternatives](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-protection-platforms/vendor/crowdstrike/product/falcon/alternatives)\n\n\\[6\\] Goldman Sachs CrowdStrike Holdings Initiation - July 8, 2019\n\n\\[7\\] [https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/7686/pdf](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/7686/pdf)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/04/05/2020-roundup-of-cybersecurity-forecasts-and-market-estimates/#1dd80739381d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/04/05/2020-roundup-of-cybersecurity-forecasts-and-market-estimates/#1dd80739381d)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/547e5c92-3594-4eef-9dfc-9eca37b635f4](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/547e5c92-3594-4eef-9dfc-9eca37b635f4)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://www.bamsec.com/filing/104746920003177?cik=1535527](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/104746920003177?cik=1535527)",

First if you haven't seen [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0zaqh/prpl_nurples_why_purple_valuation_just_might_make/?sort=new) you should if you plan to invest, but you can skip for now and go to this vid where CEO talks about how when the business suddenly halted due to corona they were SUCCESSFUL at pivoting beyond expectations. Imagine you get fired, and shortly after you're doing fine again - that's called having brains and determination, a good sign.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=youtu.be) \n\nWhat I liked right away about this vid was how confident and optimistic the CEO was. He isn't mumbling he's on point and knows what's good and bad. Now watch how he talks about pivoting to making small beds to help out, and then to masks. And here is where it hit me. These dudes are SMART to  have had a very specific business  for 20 years, and then to start a new company to sell  product to retail, and make this much money in 5 years you gotta be pretty freaking smart. And then to be able to pivot and have a ton of money in May again, thats brilliant.  This is why PRPL is not just about beds, these dudes will find a way to provide value and make tendies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm up on PRPL and it helped my account after ass raping, but I converted almost all calls into shares last week to be more safe for my own sanity.

        "selftext": "#**Introduction**\n\nHey all, it's ya boy Tatar back with the 2nd episode of my option series. If you missed last week, got check out last weeks as this weeks topic builds on it. You can find it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iewqhw/options_101_episode_1_an_introduction_to_the/)\n\nLets dive right in.\n\n#**What is a vertical spread?**\n\nA vertical spread is the simultaneous purchase and selling of an options contract of the same type, same expiration date, but different strike prices. If you are familiar with what a spread is, continue to the next section. I'm going to keep it basic for all the kiddos in the back.\n\nThere are four different types of vertical spreads: 1) Call Credit Spreads 2) Call Debit Spreads 3) Put Credit Spreads and 4) Put Debit Spreads\n\nLets look at an example of each with a ticker, XYZ that is trending at $50.\n\nA call credit spread would be selling a call contract that is closer to being ITM, and purchasing one farther OTM. Example: selling the $52 contract and purchasing the $55. You will receive a premium for this trade that will decay with time, lets call it $100. With this play, you want the price of XYZ to stay under $52 so you collect the full premium. Your max loss is the distance in the spread minus premium earned ($300 - $100) and max gain is the premium earned ($100). You will need to put up the collateral to cover your max loss.\n\nA call debit spread would be the opposite of above: purchasing the $52 call and selling the $55. You will pay a premium for this play, so you will not need to put up any collateral for this play. Lets keep consistent with the above example and say you paid $100 for this play. Your max loss is $100, max gain would be the distance of the spread minus premium payed ($300 - $100).\n\nA put credit spread would be selling a put contract that is closer to being ITM, and purchasing one farther OTM. Example: selling the $48 contract and purchasing the $45. You will receive a premium for this trade that will decay with time, lets call it $100. With this play, you want the price of XYZ to stay above $48 so you collect the full premium. Your max loss is the distance in the spread minus premium earned ($300 - $100) and max gain is the premium earned ($100). You will need to put up the collateral to cover your max loss.\n\nA put debit spread would be the opposite of above: purchasing the $48 put and selling the $45. You will pay a premium for this play, so you will not need to put up any collateral for this play. Lets keep consistent with the above example and say you paid $100 for this play. Your max loss is $100, max gain would be the distance of the spread minus premium payed ($300 - $100).\n\nIf you need a further explanation, checkout the Investopedia page [here.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalspread.asp)\n\n#**Vertical Spreads vs Naked Options: Greeks Analysis**\n\n**TLDR: Compared to naked calls, spreads experience less time decay, less movement when the underlying moves, and are much more affordable for longer time frames**\n\nThe basic premise behind understanding how that works is to understand the greeks. Basically, what you do is take the long option greeks and subtract the short option greeks and that will give you the greeks values for the play.\n\nI screencapped a couple options this past week for SPY and will use them to illustrate what I mean. For this example, lets look at a call debit spread.\n\nPurchase: SPY 350c and sell SPY 353c\n\n          350c          353c          Total\nPrice     3.16          -1.82         1.34\nDelta      .47          -.33           .14\nGamma      .04          -.04           ~0\nTheta     -.21           .19          -.02\nVega       .2           -.18           .02\n\nAs we can see, the spread gives us an entirely different greeks profile than if we bought the 350c naked.\n\nSo, lets get into the pros and cons of these type of spreads when comparing them to their naked conuterpart.\n\n#**Pros:**\n\n1) **Each play is cheaper.** This will allow you to either buy more contracts of the same play, or buy more expensive contracts.\n\n2) **The price moves against you slower.** Since gamma and delta are neutralized, the underlying moving against you will have less impact on the play. \n\n3) **Time decay is lessened.** There will still be time decay as long as both legs are OTM, but it is drastically reduced. In the example above, the spread time decay is 10% what the naked 350c is.\n\n4) **Theta works FOR you when both legs are ITM.** Keep in mind that this will be a slow burn, and most will close out their spread when it gets here, but some times it might be worth holding the spread and letting time decay work in your favor.\n\n5) **You can purchase contracts with longer expiration dates.** Since these contracts can be very expensive, this can open up some plays to a smaller account that they might not have been able to afford before.\n\n6) **Easier to cut your losses.** Since the spread takes longer to move against you due to decreased delta and theta, you have more time to wait and think about closing it out for a smaller loss.\n \n#**Cons:**\n\n1) **You won't be able to earn the full profit until expiration day.** This is due to the fact that each contract will have extrinsic value that gets lessened as the contracts get close to expiry.\n\n2) **You limit your upside.** This can't be ignored, since you are selling an option, any price movement beyond that option doesn't offer any more intrinsic value to the spread. However, since we can often buy more spreads, this can actually benefit us. I'll get into that below.\n\n3) **Getting fills is harder.** If you are trying to make a play on an illiquid option, or want to get a bargain on your limit price, it might take a while to get filled, if at all. This can be counteracted by legging into a spread, which I will get into later.\n\n#**Calculating max profit compared to just buying a naked option**\n\nI expect a lot of you retards to scoff at the idea of limiting your gains, but pump the breaks before going full retard.\n\nWhen I purchase a spread, my goal is to purchase 3 spreads for the price of 1 naked option. Sometimes it's 2:1, but with each additional spread you purchase you have the opportunity for increased gains.\n\nUsing the example of SPY above, 1 naked option of 350c would cost $316. A 350c/353c spread costs $134, so you could purchase 2 spreads for $268. \n\nIf SPY goes to 353, the spreads will yield $300 more profit than the naked option.\n\nYour breakeven would be $356, with both plays being worth the same at that point.\n\nYou are limiting your upside only if the underlying goes above $356.\n\nSo while it is a fair criticism to talk about limiting upside risk, most of the time our plays would benefit from purchasing spreads instead. Especially the closer to expiry we purchase.\n\n#**Tips:**\n\nSo I am still tweaking my personal strategy, but here are a few things I've learned so far that might be helpful:\n\n1) Purchasing spreads &lt; 45 DTE. I found that purchasing options beyond that yields much slower gains, and I find myself closing them out for smaller profit to free up the capital. If you want to buy a leap, just buy the leap naked.\n\n2) Legging into a spread. What I like to do sometimes is purchase a call with the intention of selling the other leg of the spread at a later time. This can be tricky to pull off sometimes, but having this tool in your toolbox gives you more options.\n\n3) CUT YOUR DAMN LOSSES. Since spreads take longer to move against you, cutting your losses yields less overall loss than naked options. \n\n4) Buy multiple spreads of the same play. This adds a multiplier effect to your gains, and IMO is the best way to take advantage of spreads compared to naked options.\n\nPositions: AAPL 560/580 debit spread, rest cash",

        "selftext": "This is actually my first DD I've ever posted so fuck you and forgive me if this doesn't work out for you.  \nI've been looking at $PSTG for a while now and if my buying power wasn't so fucked from my decision to buy 8/7 UBER puts, I would have been already all over this play. \n\nWhat got me looking into Pure Storage was some unusual options activity alert. I've looked into this company before but didn't entirely understand what they do. Now after looking at them again, I'm still not exactly sure wtf they do....BUT I've gotten a better understanding. Basically what I got from this research is that these guys fuck with \"all-FLASH data storage solutions (enabling cloud solutions and other low-latency applications where tape/disk storage does not meet the needs).\"......and ultimately what this all means to me is these motherfuckers make those stupid fast laser money printers with the rocket ships attached. That's something I'm interested in.\n\nNow, here is the D^(aily)D^(ick) you all degenerates have all been fiending for:  \n*Fundamentally*:  \n[Pure Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage) remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double-digits, yet remains constantly cucked and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21\n\nThe 36 Months beta value for PSTG stock is at 1.62.   \n74% Buy Rating on RH.   \nPSTG has a short float of 7.28% and public float of 243.36M with average trading volume of 3.16M shares. This was trading at around $18 on Wednesday 8/5 when I started writing this and as of right now, it's about $17.33. \n\nThe company has a market capitalization of \\~$4.6 billion. In the last quarter, PSTG reported a ballin'-ass profit of $256.82 million. Pure Storage also saw revenues increase to $367.12 million. As of 04-2020, they got cash money flowing at $11.32 million . The company\u2019s EBITDA came in at -$62.81 million which compares very fucking well among its dinosaur ass peers like HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp. Pure Storage keeps taking market share from them old farts while growing the chad-like revenues of 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21. \n\nChart of their financial growth since IPO in 2015:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7\n\nAt the end of last quarter, Pure Storage had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.274B, compared with $1.299B as of Feb 2, 2020. The total Debt to Equity ratio for PSTG is recording at 0.64 and as of 8/6, Long term Debt to Equity ratio is at 0.64.   \nEarning highlights from last quarter:\n\n* Revenue $367.1 million, up 12% year-over-year\n* **Subscription Services revenue** $120.2 million, up 37% year-over-year\n* GAAP gross margin 70.0%; non-GAAP gross margin 71.9%\n* GAAP operating loss $(84.9) million; non-GAAP operating loss $(5.4) million\n* Operating cash flow was $35.1 million, up $28.5 million year-over-year\n* Free cash flow was $11.3 million, up $29.0 million year-over-year\n* Total cash and investments of $1.3 billion\n\nI bolded the Subscription Services Revenue bullet because to me that's a big deal. Pure Storage keeps them coming back with products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store and everybody knows that the recurring revenue model is best model. Big ass enterprises buy storage from vendors such as Pure Storage in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers. $$$\n\nWhat are Pure Storage's other revenue drivers? Well these motherfuckers also have the products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01su6chrwnf51.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e6a705f9392291bc0c3932c815802d9101365e\n\nSo far, it seems like Pure Storage's smart ass [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHE7X5Gt71o) has been spot on with his prediction of the flash storage sector's direction. Pure Storage's \"Pure-as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store\" unified subscription offerings is fo sho gaining momentum it. This shit is catching on with enterprises, both big and small. COVID-19 increased the acceleration of our digital transformation and our subsequent shift to the cloud. The increased demand in data-centers is going to drastically help Pure Storage's future top and bottom line and to top it off, **NAND prices are recovering** (inferred from MU earnings). I expect Pure Storage to get some relief on the pricing front because of this which obviously in turn should improve revenues. \n\nPSTG's numbers look pretty good to me so far but are they a good company overall? Even when scalping and trading, I don't like to fuck with overall shitty companies so I always check for basic things like customer satisfaction, analyst ratings/targets, broad-view industry trends, and hedge fund positioning.. that sort of thing.   \n**Pure Storage stands out in all of these fields for me.**   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4n0e5nve5of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=495416bb6f5a2dab77f3ac483ca4d9510b39037c\n\nCustomers like Dominos Pizza and many others all seem to be happy AF with no issues. I can hardly even find a negative review online. The products seems to be universally applauded. Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider Pure Storage's product line-up some of the best in the industry. \n\nThe industry average for this sector is a piss poor 65.  \nPure Storage has a 2020 Net Promoter Score of [86](https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/pure-storage)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w51io8yvmf51.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f7d06825d0ad9d126216e5069af2f9c3636f86a\n\nEnterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and modern data arrays that are based on NAND flash because they're forced to keep up with the increasing speed of the future of business inter-connectivity. This isn't changing because of the pandemic and this isn't changing in the future.. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled like the fat fucks at IBM need to be. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than the old school storage vendors like bitchass NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM. \n\nPure Storage\u2019s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year - LIKE A PROPER HIGH GROWTH COMPANY.   \nHPE, NetApp and IBM, like the losers they are, lost market share.   \nAccording to [blocksandfiles.com](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/07/03/gartner-all-flash-array-revenues-q12020/), AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:\n\n* \u201cDell EMC \u2013 34.8% (calculated $766m) vs. 33.7% a year ago\n* NetApp \u2013 19.3% at $425m vs. 26.7% a year ago\n* Pure Storage \u2013 12.7% at calculated $279.7m vs. 10.1% a year ago\n* HPE \u2013 8.4% \u2013 $185m vs. 10% a year ago\"\n\nPure has been gaining share almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as the following chart shows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5agj17gcgnf51.png?width=428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9c6389baccab85261d6e0f71b3474e84b90d3c\n\n**Hedge Funds are on this like flies on shit.** \n\nAlliancebernstein L.P. grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.5% in the 4th quarter. Alliancebernstein L.P. now owns 104,390 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $1,786,000 after purchasing an additional 560 shares during the last quarter. \n\nLegal &amp; General Group Plc grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.3% in the 1st quarter. Legal &amp; General Group Plc now owns 258,791 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $3,213,000 after purchasing an additional 753 shares during the last quarter. \n\nSunbelt Securities Inc. acquired a new stake in Pure Storage in the 4th quarter worth $4,106,000. \n\nCENTRAL TRUST Co grew its position in Pure Storage by 79.8% in the 2nd quarter. CENTRAL TRUST Co now owns 3,226 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $56,000 after purchasing an additional 1,432 shares during the last quarter. \n\nNorthwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. grew its position in Pure Storage by 203.0% in the 1st quarter.

Looks like its found support at the 50 DMA and zooming out , the chart just looks like to me that it's coiling up for a big breakout. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxtz8minmnf51.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7baabbd3e8f97dfc8bd0d5bfa512613c2eea4921\n\nThese fucking shorts are going to get squeezed out hard.

If/when RSI breaks out, I want to play this thing aggressively with bullish call calendar spreads....THAT IS IF I HAD SOME FUCKING BUYING POWER (FUCK YOU UBER)....  \nSoooo really what I'll be doing is asking my wife's boyfriend sometime this weekend for a loan. That way on Monday I can buy some **$PSTG 9/18 $17.5 &amp; $20 calls** at open and YOLO my saddness away for a week.  \nGod forbid, I might even buy of those things called \"shares\" I heard about from /r/investing if at all possible because in all honesty, I really do feel like this is a good company to hold in a long term growth portfolio.  \nPure Storage is NOT looking like your average KODK prostitute to flip or scalp and actually more like someone you'd bring home to your 2 dads.   \n**EARNING DATE: 8/25**\n\nPure Storage has a history of beating estimates and rocketing up. Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply fuck-ups at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business...but then again NAND prices look to be recovering now if MU's earning isn't fucking with us and telling us fibs. Big money is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a disrespectful ass penny....Fuck that conservative ass guidance! I think PSTG is going to blow that shit out the water.  \nThis chart shows Pure Storage\u2019s past performance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4xflpezdhnf51.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1660a80a1a1821ef8098791a8cee632e25f1445\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fuen3n65of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9737a8d2c2a04163f447cf6d0ee287b40235868e\n\nMy Prediction: After ER on **8/25**, Pure Storage will hit new 52 week highs.   \n$20.50  - $23.50 is my guess. Bold prediction, $27.50+ by the EOY and $50 by December 2021.  \n\n\ntldr: **PSTG 9/18 $17.5 &amp; $20 calls**",

        "selftext": "There are different ways to play TSLA to $2000 this past week. Here\u2019s my thought process on how I approached trading the move up, without paying a debit (but uses margin).\n\n# The Entry\n\nOn Monday, August 17, besides TOS being absolutely atrocious, TSLA was lurching higher, and at around 11am PST or so, when it broke out to new highs, my thought was that there\u2019s probably going to be a short squeeze again that takes us to $2000, the target that basically everyone was looking at. So, I looked to put on a play that captured something to that $2000 price level by Friday, Aug 21 expiration. \n\nI began by looking at the 1980/2000 long call vertical. At the time, that spread cost $2.28 debit. So if I were to just put on that vertical, I would be paying $2.28 to make potentially $17.72. But I don\u2019t really like paying large debits (large is anything above $.25 per spread), especially for these types of short-term directional bets. \n\nSo I looked for other ways to reduce the debit. Alongside the purchase of the long call vertical, I also sold the 1650/1625 put vertical, for $2.05 credit. The reason for placing the short strike of the put vertical at 1650 is that it was under Monday\u2019s low, and the reason for the long strike at 1625 was that it made the put vertical wide enough to collect a decent credit. Now, the total debit on the trade became $2.28 (debit of 1980/2000 call vertical) - $2.05 (credit from 1650/1625 put vertical), or $.23.\n\n$.23 was pretty cheap, and honestly I could\u2019ve stopped there. But as I was thinking about the trade, I realized I didn\u2019t really like how the short put verticals actually added more downside risk to the trade. So I was thinking that as early as I could, I would buy back that short put vertical once it drained in value, as TSLA continued running up with the momentum it had. And given the huge upside momentum that day, I thought that TSLA would probably gap and continue higher the following day, or at the very least just move sideways, which would drain the value of the short put vertical and allow me to buy it back for a low debit.\n\nHowever, if I bought back the put vertical before it fully drained to 0, then my overall debit on the trade wouldn\u2019t just cost $.23 anymore - it would cost more. So in the spirit of keeping the debit as low as possible, I needed to actually collect more credit from somewhere else, if I really didn\u2019t want to pay for this trade. So, I decided that I was going to sell a call vertical above the 1980/2000 long call vertical. And a safe enough distance above the long call vertical, would be up at 2200, which gives me 200 points of runway above 2000. So I sold to open the 2200/2250 call vertical, for $1.27 credit. \n\nI felt safe about selling the 2200/2250 call vertical, because for it to really be at risk, TSLA would first need to move above 2000, the psychological level, and by the time it starts to get near 2200, the 1980/2000 call vertical will be 20 points deep ITM, so I have 20 points of coverage.  Of course there\u2019s still 30 points of risk (given that the 2200/2250 short call vertical is 50 points wide), but time is on my side. Assuming that TSLA even gets near 2200 on the last day, given how little time left there is, that short call vertical would probably be trading for maybe $10 or so, and the 1980/2000 long call vertical in front of that short call vertical, would be deep ITM and worth $20, so I can just close the entire spread at a profit anyway.\n\nSo after selling that 2200/2250 call vertical, the trade went from $.23 debit to $1.04 credit (because $.23 - $1.27 = -$1.04, or $1.04 credit). Now I\u2019m getting paid to play the breakout to TSLA 2K.\n\n# The Adjustment\n\nOn Tuesday, TSLA gapped up higher, and right off the bat, the short put verticals basically drained from $2.05 to $.83. I closed that out to remove any downside risk, so that if TSLA decides to reverse and tank, or hang out sideways and never make it to 2000, no harm no foul, I have the upside play on for a credit. Recall that $.23 (the debit of the initial entry) - $1.27 (the credit collected from the sale of the 2200/2250 call vertical) + $.83 (the debit of buying back the short put vertical) is -$0.21, which is a $.21 credit, after adjustments. And now, I just have to manage TSLA to the upside.\n\nThe result of this adjustment left me with a 4 legged spread where I\u2019m long the 1980/2000 call vertical and short the 2200/2250 call vertical (this 4-legged spread is also called a condor, specifically a Call condor).\n\nThroughout Tuesday and all of Wednesday, TSLA just moved sideways, and I was fine with that. Others who purchased naked long calls far OOM were worried about the premium drain, but I was fine knowing that I got paid to play the move to 2K, whether it happened or not. It completely did not matter if TSLA moved sideways or tanked, because it wouldn\u2019t negatively impact the equity curve. Another reason why I actually liked TSLA hanging sideways is that it gives TSLA less of a chance to surge higher and run over that 2200/2250 short call vertical with the time left before expiry. \n\n# The Exit\n\nThursday was where the magic happened (for pretty much everyone). As we know at around 7:45 am PST, TSLA rallied from around $1900 to almost $2000, and the Call condor really started to expand in value. When TSLA was at $1990, the call condor spread expanded to $8.34. \n\nRecall that the cost on this trade (after the closing the short put vertical) put my cost at a $.21 credit. Now, I can sell this condor out and pocket another $8.34. That\u2019s pretty sweet. Getting paid $.21 to make another $8.34.\n\n(At this moment, I noted what the legs were trading for. The long vertical of the condor was trading for $9.27, and the short vertical was actually trading for $.93. Recall that when I entered the short vertical on Monday, I actually collected a $1.27 credit on it. Now, even after the 150 point move up in TSLA, even after volatility expansion, that short vertical was still worth $.34 LESS - that\u2019s the power of theta decay). \n\nSo at that point, I pretty much just closed out the entire position. I was pretty happy with essentially getting paid $.21 to make another $8.34 (in hindsight, I could\u2019ve milked another $11.66 per spread, but that\u2019s besides the point).\n\n# FAQ\n\n* **What if TSLA decided to tank upon entry, jeopardizing the short put vertical?**  \nUpside conviction was strong, but I would have to buy it back and find a way to reduce the new debit on the overall trade.  \n\n* **What if TSLA decided to make a run up to $2000+ very early on in the week (ie. on Tuesday it runs up to $2100)? Then the 2200/2250 short call vertical would\u2019ve expanded too much and offset the gains of the deep ITM 1980/2000 long call vertical.**  \nI would have to cough up the debit and buy additional call verticals to cover the upside. Perhaps a 20 or 30 point wide call vertical around the 2100 strike to cover the remaining upside risk, which would cost around $10-$15 debit. Then work to reduce that debit over the week.  \n\n* **But what if TSLA decided to tank below 2100 after adjustment above? Or lower to below 1980? Or even further down?**  \nSell more 2200/2250 call verticals. Then sell out the long call vertical for whatever remaining debit. Then sell out the 1980/2000 call vertical for whatever value it has left.  \n\n* **So many adjustments. KISS. You will just get whipsawed and use up a ton of margin.**  \nIt's just what I have to do. I have to be mechanical about the greeks and not play the hope card. This trading style is not for everyone and is not the holy grail.  \n\n* **It\u2019s hard to read this. Is there a more visual explanation?**  \nHere\u2019s a video on it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAlF91COka0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAlF91COka0)  \n\n\nTL;DR - I collected a $.21 credit to make an additional $8.34, netting $8.55 profit per spread.",

        "selftext": "First of all, like you, I am also a retard. If my life depended on explaining the difference between a T cell and B cell, I\u2019d tell you to just make it quick and painless. Unlike you however, I\u2019m aware of my condition and try to minimize the damage. I took an interest after reading the latest insider sell off on another WSB thread here. Here is a recap of where we are with Moderna:\n\n* First, I would read the excellent Washington Post article: \u201c[A coronavirus vaccine rooted in a government partnership is fueling financial rewards for company executives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/02/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna-rna/#comments-wrapper)\u201d. Since your attention span is probably shot from too much KODK bag holding, key points from the article include:\n* Moncef Slaoui, Chief Scientist for Operation Warp Speed, was a board member of Moderna immediately before taking the new government role. It is my opinion that this government relationship with Moderna creates a conflict of interest and plays a part in propelling Moderna\u2019s vaccine hype and continued access to government funding. Slaoui was not required to disclose his holdings and ended up divesting $10 million in Moderna stock options after Moderna received federal funding ([source](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-tsar-divest-his-10-million-in-stocks-from-moderna-2020-5)). I believe that is his entire holdings in Moderna so there may not be an apparent conflict moving forward, only unapparent conflict.\n* Moderna\u2019s vaccine tech is based on mRNA carrying a spike protein. The spike protein triggers the immune system to create antibodies and was invented by the NIH and Univ of Texas. Moderna has a \u201cnonexclusive\u201d license to the spike protein patent according to the NIH. In my opinion, this gives Dr. Fauci and the NIH a natural incentive and bias in specifically Moderna\u2019s success. Also, Dr. Fauci and the NIH would probably be more familiar with Moderna and the spike protein rather than the other vaccine candidates since for those they would be on the outside looking in. This would explain Dr. Fauci\u2019s more optimistic stance on Moderna compared to others when discussing with media.\n* Not in the article is an interview by [Contagio](https://www.contagionlive.com/)n with Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong titled [Can Moderna's COVID 19 Vaccine Generate Lasting Immunity?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gEsOWDVYFQ) (it\u2019s a 5 minute youtube clip from a longer interview uploaded July 27). For the uninitiated, Dr. Soon-Shiong is just your normal transplant surgeon/professor/billionaire businessman/inventor of Abraxane which is used to treat lung, breast and pancreatic cancer. For the math nerds, this man has more approved drugs than Moderna (but then again, you have the same amount of approved drugs as Moderna).\n* Now I\u2019m not going to lie, I don\u2019t understand much of the medical jargon being thrown around (again, my retard knows bounds), but it gets really interesting when [Dr. Soon-Shiong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Soon-Shiong) begins discussing Moderna\u2019s vaccine results from the [3:36](https://youtu.be/9gEsOWDVYFQ?t=216) mark. He goes on to say \u201cone of my greatest fears is unfortunately being borne out\u201d in that Moderna\u2019s vaccine results show antibodies but a deeper look at Moderna\u2019s supplement shows that \u201cT cells are quite literally zero\u201d after explaining why T cells are the key to a long term vaccine.\n* At this point, the other oncologist (i.e. cancer doctor), [Dr. Adam Brufsky](https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/faculty_info.aspx/Brufsky4971), chimes in with \u201cYou\u2019re saying everything I was going to say. You\u2019re stealing a lot of it. Keep going, it\u2019s great!\u201d (yeah, this isn't directly relevant but I enjoyed the bro moment).\nLaughs were had by all, then Dr. Soon-Shiong summarizes that he is concerned with an RNA vaccine because \u201cthe generation of that RNA is going to happen just for a short period of time and maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re not generating the T cells from the Moderna results.\u201d\n* Now, I could just trust what the literal Batman of cancer fighting said but I checked the Moderna [Preliminary Report](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483) published by the New England Journal of Medicine and its [Supplementary Index](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483/suppl_file/nejmoa2022483_appendix.pdf) to confirm his T cell claims. Again, I have no idea what a T cell is or does, but I believe Dr. Soon-Shiong was referring to the charts on pages 22-24 of the Supplement which show very little T cell responses, if any.\n* And this is of course in addition to Moderna\u2019s insider sell off where Moderna executives (including CEO, CFO and CMO), board members, and a venture capital fund run by Moderna\u2019s own chairman of the board ([Flagship Pioneering](https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/noubar-afeyan)) collectively sold almost $101 million worth of stock. The WaPo article above goes into more detail if you missed this gigantic dump signal.\nHow the story ends: Like everybody else I want a vaccine too, but this ain\u2019t the one. In my opinion, it seems Moderna has played the business side of the COVID response perfectly... but at the end of the day, you can\u2019t juke the juice. They bought some time before their house of cards collapse when CEO Stephane Bancel said results could be ready in November. The only thing their delivering in November is a big dose of disappointment, whether it's in the form of a delay, poor results, or another vaccine does better.\nStay away, buy puts, short the stock, whatever you want... but Americans deserve better. If Moderna doesn\u2019t create a vaccine and ends up siphoning nearly $1 billion in federal funding, they better find a vaccine for retardation because I\u2019m going to lose my shit.\n\nMRNA 70P 15 JAN 21",

They are KING marketers. Investing 90 million dollars on a kid without playing a day in the NBA? At the time people thought Nike was batshit insane for signing that type of deal.

Nike has its finger on the pulse of American culture. \n\nWell, Nike has done it again.

The effect? Nike is Drake, Drake is Nike. Syllogism greek shit. Basically, it means Nike has cemented itself in our culture.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Drake pops up wearing JORDAN 13's that matches the entire of an expensive ass rolls Royce looking Benz. Oh, did I mention he's got an absolute baddie in the passenger seat? = For the culture\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*He's literally just walking around chilling around the NIKE campus. Oh, he walks into that cool looking building. \\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*What's that? Oh, nothing just a marketing ploy with \\*Kevin Durant\\* and NIKE BASKETBALL. What does every basketball fan in America want to do more than anything else? Here's a guess: play an intimate game of pickup with the biggest simp in the \\*NBA\\*? Well, \\*KD\\* does just that. The man just hoops with KD in a dope ass facility. \\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Remember this, NIKE wants us to know how dope their facilities are, after all, it's what makes their brand vision.\\*\\* \n\n\\*\\*Then \\*Drake\\* casually reunites at the employee NIKE store with another hot smoke show with two shopping carts that are literally filled to the brim with NIKE products.  In case you fucktards don't get it yet, this means two very important things:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*NIKE is strategically creating their brand identity-  All these cool facilities show how dope of a company NIKE is. Imagine if your company literally had a specially designed store where it's employees could shop for shit that they genuinely wanted. Well, that's exactly the type of business NIKE wants you to think they are. How could you cucks not love an employee that treats their employees like their princesses? \\*\\*\n2. \\*\\*\\*Drake\\* shops at NIKE- This one's simple. \"Drake is cool\". Drake wears NIKE. NIKE is cool. In case you didn't already know, \"Nike is cool\" is pretty much synonymous with \"Nike is rich\". \\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Ok, we are back outside now. Wait, what? Drake could play football too? Oh shit, that's \\*Odell Beckham Junior\\*. Doing one of those typical 60-yard throws he likes throwing.

Yes, it is literally Drake pretending to do a photo shoot for his #1 draft pick to the NBA, accompany by his feature, Lil Durk. Once again, Nike is trying to show us that they are what every one of us little wannabee hoopers wants to be: a number one draft pick. \\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*nothing much, just two of the coolest dudes in the world right now riding cool vehicles around exotic locations.

Again, every football fan's dream.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*But the real reason for the music video trying to be funny? Well, this shit's gotta go viral right? What do people like? \\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*People like funny shit. This is funny shit. Your music doesn't even have to be good to be profitable. If it's funny, it'll sell. Lil dicky proves that this works with his funny ass short films he calls music videos\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*cut scene to drake partying with some cool ass people in our culture. Some more fine bitches. Cut scenes to drake turning uncool sports like swimming and golf into fucking stud fests.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Oh, now he's breaking a sweat with KD.  Now he's running with a gas mask strapped to a treadmill.  Now, why would Nike want to portray this? Two Reasons:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Nike's wants us to believe that their products are so good that they would make us be able to compete with the world's best athletes.\\*\\*\n2. \\*\\*Nike wants us to know that they are on the cutting edge of sports technology. Why is this important? because that creates perceived value in their products and that gives them a reason to charge you more for shitty shoes. Want some more logic Nike sells $200 shoes. Every nonhomeless person in the world will buy at least a pair of shoes a year. = Nike is rich\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*YOU FUCKING RETARDS SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY NIKE BEING RICH MEANS THAT INVESTING IN THEM IS GOOD. THE RICH GET RICHER RIDDLE TAUGHT US THAT INVESTING IN NIKE IS GOOD. WE JUST NEED TO LISTEN. \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:  THEORY THAT ARGUES THAT DRAKE'S LAST MUSIC VIDEO WAS A MARKETING PLOY BY NIKE. BY UTILIZING THEIR ENDORSEMENT DEALS NIKE WAS ABLE TO SECURE THE RIGHTS TO SOME OF THE WORLDS BIGGEST ATHLETES AND ARTISTS. TOGETHER THEY CREATED A HIGHLIGHT REEL OF CLIPS THAT EVERY PERSON IN AMERICA DREAMS TO EXPERIENCE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. BY CONTINUING TO MAKE US LOVE THEM AND THEIR ABILITY TO BECOME A PART OF OUR CULTURE, NIKE WILL ONLY GROW BIGGER AND BIGGER. INVEST IN NIKE.",

        "selftext": "Good morning fellas. Swaggy is back with a Sunday morning read and summary of unusual options activity for the week. I've highlighted some plays that came across as unusual based on how far OTM the bet was, the premium paid, and the volume of contracts in the play. If you want to check out additional tickers for yourself, you can scan the [unusual option flow tracker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) that I use at your liking (it's free).\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nSaw a bullish position in ADBE being opened with a debit spread. My scanner missed the long leg being opened, but I managed to catch the play by digging deeper. I\u2019ve added the OI from Yahoo Finance so you can see the contracts. Stock is currently sitting at $450 after Friday\u2019s -3% move. The debit spread was in October\u2019s $450 strike (long leg) and sold the $490 strike (short leg). Earnings aren\u2019t until September 15.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5zwew1t8zf51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb0137a19b57af372a8bc574686146ec796933b\n\n**CNK \u2013 Cinemark**\n\nA bit of an unusual ticker for unusual activity. Cinemark saw some pretty heavy call buying on Friday. The stock has been on a bit of a run recently. One player bought calls 80% OTM for the $20 strike (stock is currently $11). This play was only $55k, but highly suspect with how far out the money they went. The play has an expiration date for September 18. I\u2019ve attached Yahoo Finance option chain for August 21 so you can see the heavy volume in the near OTM strikes. This stock typically does not have high volume with options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfl6sgou8zf51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c240cd54686a66f589a3733cc3a44437c29467d\n\n**FB \u2013 Facebook**\n\nFacebook had a huge melt up Thursday and Friday. Volume on option activity was well above the average for the last 2 weeks. Saw a good amount of CALL buying with some CALL selling far OTM as well. Most of the call selling (potentially covered calls?) were done with expirations in the next 1-3 weeks. The call buying had expirations toward the end of the year and even into 2021. Long-term bullish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h59saplv8zf51.png?width=2856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36f92032e3c7444ec4f41e4a83bc22468518393\n\n**MSFT \u2013 MicroTok**\n\nMicrosoft saw a massive bullish debit spread opened in November 2020 calls. 75,000 CALL contracts bought with the $220 strike while selling 75,000 CALL contracts at the $240 strike. Looks like the player/fund is expecting upside, but wanted to limit their downside by opening a spread. They have a max risk of $49 million with a max reward of $150 million if MSFT closes above $240 by November.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/804hwqew8zf51.png?width=2858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f76633f4b0db8220a1d1053daa8f54f5b796121\n\n**SDC \u2013 Smile Direct Club**\n\nAnother unusual ticker, this stock saw some unusual call buying recently. Two trades in particular were for next week\u2019s earnings report (August 12). Both trades are for $9 strike, which is currently in-the-money. When the trades were initiated the stock was trading at $8.82. Judging from the OI it looks like of the 16k contracts traded, only 10k are left on the Open Interest. He may have sold part of his position to collect profit, but left a lot on the table for next week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4ish39x8zf51.png?width=2740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08d9b879e6326f3a90959a6c2e9087da82ab9c1c\n\n**Snap \u2013 Snapchat**\n\nSnap saw extremely high volume of call options traded relative to it\u2019s average. Bullish flow out-weighed bearish flow by 3.5 to 1. Could be potential TikTok play as they expect the ban to increase their own share. There\u2019s was a lot of flow to go through on this ticker, so I\u2019m only mentioning that flow in general was above the average here and also more on the bullish side.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy8yygxx8zf51.png?width=2858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a02ccb95317ec638ac9566cbae050a86c6067d22\n\n**V \u2013 Visa**\n\nVisa saw some unusual option flow last week on Wednesday. That day alone the stock gapped up 2% and closed another 3% higher. Stock is currently trading at $196 and most of the call blocks had strikes of $202.5-$205. Visa generally does not have that much volume on option flow so it\u2019s always interesting to keep an eye on. If you look at the price action of the stock is has been in range-bound trading in the $190-$200 channel for almost 3 months now. Hit\u2019s $200 and drops back down to $190, then touches $190 and makes it\u2019s way back up to $200. Maybe some flow rolling through will be enough to have it break out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7wovjqy8zf51.png?width=2860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e352e915225089fb7e9f31524ed1fe04cbdefd",

        "selftext": " Since   its\u2019 Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares   have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its\u2019   next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive   collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality   the situation has been years in the making for those who\u2019ve been  paying  attention. Today I\u2019d like to look at some of the technical  decisions  Intel made, why they\u2019ve caused problems and the implications  of that on  their future.\n\n**Lithography techniques**\n\nLithography   is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible   competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a   template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and   shine a powerful laser on it [\\[1\\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).\n\nOver   time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area \u2013 this   would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption   and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\\[2\\]. This becomes   progressively more difficult over time, as you\u2019re trying to cram   transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a   hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm   mark, since the size of the laser you used to \u2018print\u2019 the circuit design   became so relatively big that it couldn\u2019t reliably follow the   complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of   thought developed to address this problem \u2013 patterning (using more than   one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with   each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet,   using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel   saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its\u2019 22 and 14nm   process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on   its\u2019 10nm process.\\[3\\] Meanwhile, its\u2019 competitors TSMC and Samsung  chose  EUV. \\[4\\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to  pursue EUV  for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to  which was the  right choice\u2026\n\nOther  terminology  I\u2019ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a  wafer is  actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of  the wafer  as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed  from  several pieces of silicon stuck together)\n\n**The problems with 10nm**\n\nBack   in 2013, Intel was in it\u2019s prime. It dominated the CPU market with   &gt;90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its\u2019   chips \u2013 every two years you would have a die shrink \u2018tick\u2019, then the   alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change \u2018tock\u2019. In   the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next \u2018tock\u2019   of 10nm in 2016. The \u2018tick\u2019 \u2013 Skylake architecture came, but the \u2018tock\u2019   never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released,   10nm still isn\u2019t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake   in 2018 \u2013 but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not   hundreds. On paper, the \u2018mass-market\u2019 generation Ice Lake launched in   2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior   performance to Intel\u2019s own 14nm offerings. \\[5\\] The latest update is that   desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 \u2013  but  for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet   again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total  writeoff,  and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage  have doomed  it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you  are bound to  have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating  billions of  devices tens of atoms in size isn\u2019t going to be perfect.  Patterning as a  lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect  rate than not  using it \u2013 you\u2019re basically going through the same  process multiple  times, thus increasing the chance of defect  dramatically. As I mentioned  earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in  10nm \u2013 this means their  defect rates are going to be sky high. At the  same time, their usage of a  monolithic die compounds this problem for  high-performance, high core  count CPU models. As you can see from the  blue wafer below, it\u2019s  difficult to draw large squares (high-core count  models) that are  without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD\u2019s  chiplet approach,  built on TSMC\u2019s less defect-prone EUV process.\n\n(Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here)\n\nSince   you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you  use  a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting  you  freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to  build.\n\nOf  course, it\u2019s impossible  for anyone outside Intel to know the exact  numbers for the defect  rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt  they are improving as  time goes on,as they always do with a maturing  architecture. However, I  can say with certainty that\n\n1. they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS\n2. The   margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has   traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the   last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole   product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%.   The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only   by AMD\u2019s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance.   If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy   margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5   year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers   would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues.\n\nThese   are bold statements but I believe Intel\u2019s actions over the past few   years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.\n\nWhen   you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it   be \u2018better\u2019 than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly   obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent   flaws that you can\u2019t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer   architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own   previous-generation Phenom II architecture \\[6\\], leading to   near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising   core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the   future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs,   massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture.   Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design   choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce   10nm high core count chips. This would\u2019ve been fine if their monopoly   continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs.   Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4  cores.  However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count  capable Zen  architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising  their own core  counts to compete \u2013 there has been a doubling of core  counts across  their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with  its\u2019 double  patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of  10nm mean that  current generation chips at the same price point from  Intel have 14nm  massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core  counts outweighing  any density improvements that 10nm brings.  Similarly, leaks for the  upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake  Xeon chips suggest that  the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will  be 33-50% lower than those  from 14nm \\[7\\] \u2013 not to mention AMD\u2019s  offerings which top out at 2.3x  the core count at half the price.\\[8\\]  The persistent lack of chips on  10nm that can outperform their  predecessors, despite us now technically  being on \u201810nm+++\u2019, suggests  that there is a fundamental barrier in the  technology that no amount of  delays and extra engineering can get past.  10nm is rotten from the  very first steps taken.\n\n**7nm and beyond**\n\nSo   now we\u2019ve established just how much of a disaster Intel\u2019s 10nm process   is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its\u2019 built  on  the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it  to  be Intel\u2019s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was   widely attributed to the \u20186 month delay\u2019 in 7nm rollout. While I don\u2019t   have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just   want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2  call  were \u2018we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm\u2026 12 months behind our   internal target\u2026 we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield   degradation\u2019.\n\nThere\u2019s quite a  lot  to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call,  were  confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at  the  same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The  truth is  that Bob\u2019s claim of a \u2018buffer in planning process\u2019 as the  reason, while  technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any  typical launch of a  new process node, you spend a few months getting up  to speed \u2013 running  the foundry through the whole process,  troubleshooting, using the  produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM  partners for them to design  products around, etc. You don\u2019t sell the  chips produced to anyone.  Industry standard is to call this period a  tape-out, not a launch of a  new process \u2013 that\u2019s when you actually  produce chips that you sell to  people. Bob\u2019s comment translated is that  the process is delayed by 12  months, but they\u2019re going to breach  industry standard and \u2018launch\u2019 7nm  when the first fabs start spinning  up 6 months before they have chips in  any volume. Sound ridiculous?  Well, Intel did the exact same thing with  10nm. Faced with mounting  pressure over the constant delays, Intel  \u2018launched\u2019 Cannon Lake in May  2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole  generation, a dual core processor  with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was  slower than the i3-3250 released  in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm  part. Not to mention it was nigh on  impossible to actually buy one.\\[9\\]  Cannon Lake was an incredibly  obvious paper launch, released to appease  investors at a time where  Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake,  the first 10nm  architecture you could actually buy (in limited  quantities) shipped in  September 2019, more than a year after Cannon  Lake \u2018launched\u2019. This  \u20186-month\u2019 delay is nothing more than an attempt to  sweetcoat a 12 month  delay (assuming no further delays).\n\nThe   second part of the comment, relating to a \u2018defect mode\u2019, is just as   interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology   for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information  suggesting  they might move away from this if it proves to be too  difficult. \\[10\\]  GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is  a new and  unproven transistor technology that should overcome the  technical  difficulties current transistor technologies face at  increasingly  smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is  going to a  completely new type of transistor and we only have one other  comparable  in history \u2013 the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few  years ago.  With FinFet, the research process from having a \u2018working  prototype\u2019  demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \\[11\\]  Meanwhile,  the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years  ago.\n\n\\[12\\]  While FinFeT and  GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the  plans from  Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly  ambitious. The  latest leaks suggest that the \u2018defect mode\u2019 Intel have  ran into has to  do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true,  you could easily  see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.\n\nBeyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/)   As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV   and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage   in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm.   At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs.  They  might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've  finally  come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little  technologies, all of  which I'll explore in a future blog post.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019ll   leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these   deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is   far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel   will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet   another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD,   outsourcing production fully and writing off its\u2019 own fabs?   Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible   margins from their monopolistic position?\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html)\n\n\\[2\\][Dennard,    R., Gaensslen, F., Hwa-Nien Yu, Rideout, V., Bassous, E. and Leblanc,    A., 1999.

Uber\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d full year 2019 result was a GAAP loss of $8.5 billion with a (-60%) margin, but these were based on problematic accounting that makes it impossible to evaluate Uber\u2019s financial performance properly over time. After necessary adjustments that were documented in Part 22 [1], the more meaningful full year 2019 result was a GAAP loss of $5.9 billion with a (-42%) margin. Uber has now lost $23.2 billion in the past four and a half years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber burned $4 billion in cash in the first half of 2020. As of June 30th, it had $7.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments on hand. Uber\u2019s full year 2019 cash burn was $5.1 billion.\n&gt; \n&gt; For readers who have followed this series\u2019 depiction of Uber\u2019s awful economics and financial results over the past four years, these headlines may seem no more surprising than \u201cFrancisco Franco is still dead.\u201d [2] Nothing has happened to change the fact that after ten years, riders have always been fundamentally unwilling to pay prices that would cover Uber\u2019s actual costs, that Uber was always less efficient than the traditional taxis it drove out of business, that its only \u201cefficiency improvement\u201d was to push driver compensation to minimum wage levels, and that its growth depended entirely on unsustainable predatory subsidies.\n&gt; \n&gt; But if anyone still thought that Uber could somehow magically reverse its multi-billion dollar losses, the coronavirus should have put their fantasies totally to rest. The coronavirus has crushed the major drivers of urban car services demand, including business travel and discretionary urban entertainment (clubs, restaurants, etc.). Their customers remain highly concerned about the health risks of all forms of public transportation.\n&gt; \n&gt; While many industries have been devastated by the coronavirus it is critical to distinguish between those that clearly had a strongly profitable business model prior to the pandemic (United Airlines, Disneyland, Major League Baseball) and a company like Uber that had been incapable of generating positive cash flow under ideal economic conditions. There needs to be discussion about how to best restructure airlines, tourist and entertainment industries because they have contributed to overall economic welfare in the past, and clearly can in the future. Uber has only served to reduce overall economic welfare. Society has nothing to gain from \u201csaving\u201d Uber.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2ndquarter Uber revenue in its core \u201crides/mobility\u201d business fell 74% ($3,056m to $790m) from the 4thquarter of 2019, the last quarter with no coronavirus impacts. Echoing issues discussed in part three of my airline series [3] there is no prospect of any type of robust \u201cV-shaped\u201d urban car service revenue recovery. Demand may remain seriously depressed for years.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2ndquarter Uber revenue in its \u201cEats/delivery\u201d business doubled but the economics of these services were always substantially worse than Uber\u2019s hopeless car service business. Uber only reports segment financial performance on an \u201cadjusted EBITDA\u201d basis that (in the 2ndquarter) excluded 38% of actual Uber expense from its \u201cprofitability\u201d calculation. But 2ndquarter \u201cEats/delivery\u201d had an \u201cadjusted EBITDA\u201d 25 margin points worse than car services, even after the big coronavirus driven boost in food delivery demand. And since Eats\u2019 year-over year \u201cadjusted EBITDA\u201d improved by only $54 million (from negative $286 million to negative $232 million) even though revenue doubled, this business is clearly not \u201cgrowing into profitability.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Food delivery is hypercompetitive (DoorDash, GrubHub, JustEat, Deliveroo), neither customers nor restaurants can afford the true cost of the service, and none of these companies have ever been sustainably profitable. Uber has never presented a plausible argument it will suddenly become the first company to realize returns from investments in this business.\n&gt; \n&gt; Coverage of these results in the business and tech industry press was a bit less fawning than the coverage Uber received a few years ago. The fact that Uber has always been unprofitable and is still facing major legal challenges to its labor practices is now at least mentioned in all stories. But none of the dozen or so stories published on Friday [4] even raised the issues of whether (or how) Uber revenue might suddenly recover, or how Uber could quickly achieve cash breakeven. The question of whether the coronavirus shock had significantly increased the risks to Uber\u2019s viability and survival was totally ignored.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most stories emphasized top-line volume numbers instead of GAAP profits or cash flow. None made any mention of the impact of the revenue collapse on Uber\u2019s drivers, who comprise roughly 80% of Uber\u2019s business model but are not included in its financial reports.\n&gt; \n&gt; A couple of stories noted that the ridesharing collapse had been ugly, but most tried to obscure this issue by emphasizing the \u201cpivot to delivery\u201d as a \u201cbright spot\u201d and highlighting Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s claims that with Eats, the company \u201chad built a second Uber in under three years\u201d and \u201cha[s] secured the path forward.\u201d None addressed the question of whether Uber could ever earn sustainable profits from food delivery. [5] None of the stories mentioned that recent Uber narrative claims such as the profit potential of driverless cars, or that it would soon become the \u201cAmazon of Transportation\u201d were totally absent from its presentation about 2ndquarter earnings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Several reporters cited Khosrowshahi\u2019s new claim that Uber would achieve \u201cEBITDA profitability\u201d by the end of 2021. None of these reporters appeared to understand that this measure was neither \u201cprofitability\u201d or \u201cEBITDA\u201d [6]. None made any effort to document how Khosrowshahi hoped to achieve these multi-billion dollar improvements, or mentioned Uber\u2019s failure to achieve any of its past profitability promises or to otherwise evaluate the credibility of its newest promise. A couple of articles noted a previous Uber\u2019s promise to remove $1 billion in \u201cfixed costs,\u201d but failed to note that Uber has never publicly explained where these cost cuts would come from, or that nothing in its 2ndquarter financial release provided any evidence of progress against that target. None considered how long it might take to exhaust Uber\u2019s remaining cash given highly depressed demand, or whether a company reporting these results would be able to attract new financing.",

A *heroic phase* ensues characterized by **\"a high level of activity with a low level of productivity\"**, where **\"risk assesment becomes impaired\"** followed by a *honeymoon phase* where **\"Optimism exists that everything will return to normal quickly\"**  \\[[Phases of Disaster](https://www.samhsa.gov/dtac/recovering-disasters/phases-disaster)\\]\n\nKinda sounds like where we're at with COVID, eh???\n\nThese good feelings are quashed about \\~5 months later, for the sentiment trends below the baseline in the disillusionment phase:  \"**During the disillusionment phase, communities and individuals realize the limits of disaster assistance. As optimism turns to discouragement and stress continues to take a toll, negative reactions, such as physical exhaustion or substance use, may begin to surface. The increasing gap between need and assistance leads to feelings of abandonment. Especially as the larger community returns to business as usual, there may be an increased demand for services, as individuals and communities become ready to accept support. The disillusionment phase can last months and even years. It is often extended by one or more trigger events.\"**  \\[[Phases of Disaster](https://www.samhsa.gov/dtac/recovering-disasters/phases-disaster)\\]\n\nAnd that sounds a whole lot like what's going to happen when stimy dries up and we head into the election: economic disillusionment.  (See my last post: [Thing Most Of You Believe Is True, That Isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hwhz83/the_thing_most_of_you_believe_is_true_but_isnt/))\n\nBut will this expected change in sentiment cause the next leg down, and drive us into the next Depression?  No idea, but we should find out soon: \n\n[The Russel Chart doesn't have the 5-6 Stonks that make the V in the SPY or QQQ](https://preview.redd.it/q2m9kkmpmhh51.png?width=1978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e736f8e8164e8b96db61b256cbae142ac76e8bca)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Inverse Sodom and Gomorrah soon, everyone not gay burns in massive fire.** \n\nBut yo, this is probably just going to embarrass me, because even I've become a habitual vibe doubter.

We can't get those months back. Additionally, the printer has been going brrrr increasing the money supply, M. We have not yet seen large increase in the price level. So why haven't we seen it?

Brace yourself, there's some reading ahead, if you are illiterate and have trouble with words, please refer to the TLDR for hand holding.\n\nKey Information (taken from simplywall.st)  \n Name: Luminex Corporation  \n Ticker: LMNX  \n Exchange: Nasdaq  \n Founded: 1995  \n Industry: Life Sciences Tools and Services  \n Sector: Pharmaceuticals &amp; Biotech  \n Market Cap: US$1.431b  \n Shares outstanding: 46.36m  \n Website: [https://www.luminexcorp.com](https://www.luminexcorp.com/)\n\nWhat do they do?  \n \u201cLuminex Corp develops, manufactures and sells proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industries. Its products include MAGPIX, Luminex 100/200, &amp; FLEXMAP 3D. \u201c\n\n\"\\[Luminex offers\\] a wide range of solutions applicable in diverse markets including clinical diagnostics, pharmaceutical drug discovery, biomedical research, genomic and proteomic research, biodefense research, and food safety.\"\n\nAre they doing anything for the coronavirus?  \n Yes, but they aren\u2019t one of the \u201cpenny stock companies\u201d who are riding the coat tails of FOMO/Hopium. Luminex has been around a very long time, and are not reliant on covid-19 related sales. With that said, they are also selling their FDA authorized (under EUA) covid-19 test (SARS-CoV-2 Assay designed for use in Luminex\u2019s ARIES Molecular Diagnostics Platform\u2013 good video on how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOy2bUePLJ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOy2bUePLJ8&amp;feature=youtu.be)). I will also mention though, that covid19 has been providing them with positive tailwinds thanks to molecular diagnostic revenue, which was $64.9M for the most recent quarter, up more than 100% compared to same quarter 2019.\n\nHow are they financially?  \n According to simplywall.st, they have [$455M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/455M) in short-term assets, $62.8M in liabilities. Their debt/equity is 39.3%. Their most recent ER, from August 4th, saw them beat earnings with 0.27 EPS vs. 0.08 consensus, and beat revenue with 109.5M vs 107.4M. Additionally, they are seeing 31.9% revenue growth year-over-year. For Full Year 2020 they are expecting revenue at or above $415M.   \n [https://www.earningswhispers.com/epsdetails/lmnx](https://www.earningswhispers.com/epsdetails/lmnx)\n\nAdditionally, their most recent ER has these highlights of the quarter mentioned:\n\n\\*\\*Licensed Technologies Group revenue of $35.2M, down 4% vs. Q2 2019  \n\\*\\*Flow Cytometry revenue of $7.4M, down 44% vs. Q2 2019, continues to be significantly impacted by the slowdown in academic research due to COVID-19  \n\\*\\*Operating cash flow of $31M and $24M for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020  \n\\*\\*Ended the quarter with an order book of approximately $29M, most of which is COVID-19 related;            almost six times the pre-COVID quarterly average  \n\\*\\*Sold or contracted 162 sample-to-answer systems in the quarter, the majority of which were ARIES\u00ae  \n\\*\\*Received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization on April 6, 2020 for the \tARIES\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 Assay  \n\\*\\* Received U.S. FDA EUA for COVID-19 antibody test on July 16, 2020\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/luminex-corporation-reports-second-quarter-200100150.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/luminex-corporation-reports-second-quarter-200100150.html)\n\nEarnings call transcript:\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/05/luminex-corp-de-lmnx-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/05/luminex-corp-de-lmnx-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx)\n\nI particularly like this portion of the CEO\u2019s statement:\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about the opportunity for this COVID-19 specific antibody tests in the market. We also submitted our **fourth assay** to the FDA for EUA clearances a few weeks ago, **a new NxTAG RPP plus SARS-CoV-2 consolidated panel**. Finally, we continue to work on a number of products in our VERIGENE family. We recently submitted SARS-CoV-2 stand-alone assay on VERIGENE I and planning to submit soon for an EUA for VERIGENE II Respiratory assay with the SARS-CoV-2 target.\n\nWe are in the process of **expanding** our total manufacturing capacity of all MDx assay **from approximately 1.8 million tests per quarter to approximately 3 million tests per quarter** as a result of **significant demand** for our product to assist in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nDo they pay a dividend?  \n Luminex has been known to pay a quarterly dividend, most recently in Q2 2020 at 1.17% which had a June 18 ex-div and was payable July 9th.   \n\nWho is their CEO?  \n Nachum Shamir is the current CEO/Chairman, and has been there since 2014. Prior to that he worked at IDB Holding from 2006 to 2014, and just prior to that in 2004/2005 he served as President of Kodak Versamark, Inc. (part of Eastman Kodak Company KODK). He currently receives a $743k salary, with total compensation of $3.36M which is roughly 25% lower than similar size companies. Mr. Shamir currently owns 0.41% of LMNX, and the only insider owning more (besides Mr. Loewenbaum) is the CFO/SVP Harriss Currie who has 0.54% ownership.\n\nWhat does institutional ownership look like?  \n According to MarketBeat.com, Q1 saw 68M bought/26M sold by institutions. Q2 saw 56M bought, 50M sold, and thus far in Q3 114M bought with only 17M sold.   \n [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/lmnx/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/lmnx/institutional-ownership/)\n\nAccording to fintel.io:  \n \u201cLuminex Corp. (US:LMNX) has 456 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 41,360,722 shares. Largest shareholders include BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc, RGM Capital, LLC, IJR - iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, Renaissance Technologies Llc, Dimensional Fund Advisors Lp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, State Street Corp, Select Equity Group, L.P., and VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares.\u201c  \n [https://fintel.io/so/us/lmnx](https://fintel.io/so/us/lmnx)\n\nWhy was there a drop recently after earnings, if they beat &amp; are growing?  \n George Loewenbaum has been with the company for 25 years, and they announced his resignation. Additionally, there was insider selling which was detailed out in May, and Mr. Loewenbaum has also been selling off some of his shares. Interesting side note, Mr. Loewenbaum also serves on the board of 3D Systems Corporation which trades under DDD and does 3d printing.  \n\nI do not believe the market cares about sentiment; in that the market makers/institutions/hedge funds are not sentimental.  Thus, I speculate the drop from $40 to $30 was largely due to the desire to get more shares at a cheaper price. If you really look at the institutional ownership, it\u2019s currently 77.37% and growing every quarter this year.\n\nAnalyzing LMNX Stock Price\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k89h61sbk7h51.jpg?width=2389&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afe6e45d00c716527e61e4f79228fe1646b27406\n\nLuminex would be $51 stock if it traded at the same p/s as [$TMO](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/TMO), or $47 if it traded at same p/b as [$ATRC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATRC).\n\nThe stock is currently trading in an upward channel, with the current price very near the bottom channel support line. If the stock falls below $29.80, it may be headed for a further decline. While I do not know the future, many stocks have been sold off immediately after ER despite beating, only to immediately recover. A good example of this is Owens &amp; Minor, Inc. (OMI ticker). They fell from $17 to $13, then rebounded back up to high $16s in the matter of 10 trading days (from fall to recovery).  \n\nOn Friday, it double bottomed around $30.50 and closed at $30.87, down 3.35% for the day. LMNX is a highly volatile stock, with 3 of the last 4 days seeing a +/- 3% movement. This appears to be quite normal for LMNX, and when it moves up, it does so sharply over a period of days or even weeks.   \n\nChart wise, D crossed above K on SlowStoch and RSI (14) is currently nearing oversold at 40.58. The MACD &amp; Signal deviation are at 3x, which is the relatively high and unusual (-.648 macd/0.213 signal). LMNX also recently bounced off the lower Bollinger band, and closed just below the MA5 $31.22.\n\nHuge growth and major institutional buying, with relatively little selling, makes this worth a closer look.\n\nOne final note I will make, are option calls open interest for next Friday, August 21st.  \n\nFor calls, there are:\n\n44 OI for $30 strike; 408 OI for $35 strike; 1130 OI for $40 strike (increased by 9 Friday); 135 OI for $45 strike\n\nFor puts, there are: 338 OI for $30 strike (increased by 2 Friday); 227 OI for $35 strike; 1 OI for $40 strike\n\nGiven the rapid price movement LMNX can make, it is interesting yet perhaps not surprising that more $40 calls are being purchased than even $30 puts. The number of calls for September, October and Jan \u201921 all vastly outweigh the puts as well. It appears that option traders are extremely bullish on LMNX continuing its upward movement for the foreseeable future.  \n\nRegarding shorts, according to shortsqueeze.com, LMNX has seen a 10% decrease in short interest, from 5,470,000 shares short to 4,900,000 shares short, now at 11.39% short percentage.  \n\nPlease do your own due diligence and feel free to comment with further information and/or thoughts.\n\nTLDR; Fuck you",

ATVI could also be a great play, as COD: Modern Warfare is doing quite well. Both companies are in really good shape in terms of their financials with their massive cash positions, and they've never been this popular before. ATVI and TTWO are sitting at around $6 billion and $2 billion in cash respectively with little debt. They have massive potentials for growth with decent PE ratios considering today's standards, and these gaming stocks have never seen a better time than now when most of the country is staying indoors.\n\nLet's be real here, every teen this summer is either gaming or streaming Riley Reid's educational videos on the hub.

        "selftext": "Alright I'm seeing enough of this shit, too many of you think Epic games is gonna slap Apple around. Here's the quick explanation so some of you autists don't waste too much money on puts at market open. So here. \n\nEverytime one of you schmucks buys some V-bucks on your iPhone XX3200. The money goes through the App Store. Apple takes a cut for the App being on the App Store. Epic obviously gets the majority. \n\nEpic decided to give you middle schoolers discounts on your v-bucks if you pay them directly. Well obviously Apple goes \"wait a second, I'm not getting my cut of the lunch money anymore\", and kicks Fortnite off because they aren't paying their due. \n\nEpic decides to go \"WAIT, YOU CAN'T HAVE A MONOPOLY OVER THE APP STORE SO WE'RE SUING\". \n\nThen over in some cave hiding from Congress, Google pokes its head out and goes \"Wait a second, WE AREN'T GETTING OUR LUNCH MONEY EITHER\" and promptly boots Fortnite off whatever the fuck store android users have. \n\nLet me quickly handle some of your questions. \n\n1. No, Fortnite absolutely violated the app stores terms and agreements. \n2. The App Store gives Fortnite like 20% of it's income. \n3. No, I don't think Apple will be broken up. They will most likely get regulations but still make a boat load of cash. \n4. Again, read #1, but instead of \"app store\", whatever you android people have. \n5. Positions?? Call me Meowth cause I'm loading up on RKT. (Yes, Boomer Reference)\n\nTL;DR; Tim Cook probably didn't even get woken up from his 14 hours of sleep to be told Epic games is suing them. Don't expect Apple to dip because of this. F for PRPL Gang.",

        "selftext": "First, let's laugh at ourselves. We never get SPAC targets right. Batting .000 at this point.  \n\n\nNow let's get down to business. You could write off Canoo as another vaporware EV company. But when you start to dig  you  see, okay, maybe these guys have something and are ahead of other EV companies that have come to market lately:  \n\n\n* They are already in pre-production testing and have built [at least 30 test vehicles](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). They've figured out how to turn their concept into a [manufactured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvWFpnUbRv8) [product](https://www.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/emobility/proof-of-concept-la-based-start-up-canoo-gets-production-ready/40572.article). \n* It's run by a team [experienced in the auto industry](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-company-overview). A lot of ex-BMW, ex-Tesla, etc. This is not another case of 'this idea is so crazy we had to hire outsiders.' \n* They built their own modular ev [skateboard](https://electrek.co/2019/12/17/canoo-eschews-traditional-vehicle-constraints-ditches-ev-battery-enclosure/) [platform](https://www.canoo.com/engineering/), similar to what large auto companies like [VW](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/modular-electric-drive-matrix-meb-3677) or [GM](https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/ev.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/mar/0304-ev.html) are doing. The platform contains batteries, motors, and control systems can be adapted to a lot of different vehicle 'shells.' Hyundai deemed it credible enough that they want to use it for their own vehicles, and they [pay Canoo for engineering services](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/hyundai-taps-ev-startup-canoo-to-develop-electric-vehicles/). They seem to have relationships with legit suppliers: [Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/startup-vehicles-drive-agx/) and [Blackberry](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoo-s-next-generation-) (QNX OS) for autonomy. [Nexen](https://www.tirebusiness.com/automotive/nexen-secures-oe-fitment-ev-skateboard-startup-canoo) for tires (still looking for their   \n battery cell supplier). \n* The leasing model is unique and perhaps unproven, but the launch plan seems [measured](https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/canoo-takes-the-covers-off-of-its-debut-electric-vehicle/), with a near-term focus on city dwellers, delivery, and [ride-shares](https://www.fleetforward.com/341195/canoo-unveils-subscription-only-ev), full autonomy longer term. \n\n&gt;The plan for 2021 is to launch in Los Angeles and have another eight cities account for the company\u2019s U.S. market. That means four on the West Coast and four on the East Coast, according to Kranz. After the launch in the U.S. we are considering launching the vehicle in China\u2026 There are 18 cities that represent 75% of the EV population in China,\n\n* They have a competent PR and social media team that gets their name out there. They've appeared in a lot of press including [Jay Leno's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM), NYT, Car &amp; Driver, are on the radar of analysts covering  EVs.\n\ntl;dr I'm long on Canoo. The more I look the more I  like it. Assuming the deal goes through, if we have FMCI effect on Monday because its not Proterra and it drops below 11 I will buy more shares.",

BigCommerce merchants can be among the first  to adopt the new feature, which provides shoppers an intuitive,  seamless and secure way to purchase products they discover on Instagram  in a few clicks, without leaving the app.\n\nLeveraging  BigCommerce\u2019s native integration with Facebook Commerce Manager,  merchants can easily connect their ecommerce storefront\u2019s catalog to  Instagram and give customers the ability to buy from their favorite  brands directly on Instagram\u2014rather than navigating to a brand\u2019s website  to make a purchase\u2014and pay using PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, American  Express or Discover. After placing an order, customers can also use the  Instagram app to view their order status, estimated delivery date and  tracking number, as well as cancel orders, initiate returns or request  additional support.\n\n\"Creating  a streamlined checkout experience is paramount for merchants looking to  social commerce to drive revenue growth. The rollout of checkout on  Instagram is another significant step in Instagram\u2019s evolution toward  becoming an essential commerce channel for customer-focused brands,\"  said Brent Bellm, chief executive officer at BigCommerce. \"BigCommerce  is proud to be one of a select group of partners to offer their  customers access to this innovative new feature at launch.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigcommerce-teams-facebook-unlock-checkout-150500474.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigcommerce-teams-facebook-unlock-checkout-150500474.html)",

        "selftext": "  \n\nThis Post intends to give an overview over the ticker RLFTF, it is divided in different sections to give a holistic overview over RLFTF. RLFTF is a Drug Development Company registered at the Swiss Stock Exchange RLF.SW and US OTC Ticker RLFTF. \n\nRLFTF's patented drug RLF-100TM(Aviptadil/VIP) has a FDA Fast Track designation and is in two Clinical Trials and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program. Preliminary data show a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most critical COVID-19 ICU Patients.^(3)\n\n**Clinical Data and Mechanism of Action - why this is the best COVID-19 drug.**\n\nRLF-100(Aviptadil/VIP) has a 30 year research history and is already Approved by some Countries for other Indications (UK Approved for Errectile Dysfunction and EU Orphan drug status for Sarcoidosis treatment \\*EU designation (EU/3/07/473)), it is already known to be a safe drug with minimal side-effects. ^(5,6)\n\n*Mechanism Of Action*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. RLF-100 inhibits the SARS-COV-2(COVID19) Virus from replicating itself by blocking the      respective receptors. **It is the only known Drug** so far that **prevents      the Virus from replicating**(spreading), it act's preventive and not just symptomatic. ^(1)\n2. RLF-100 prevents and/or stops the Zytokine Storm, is highly anti-inflamantory and acts on RANTES (CCL5) - in almost the same way that e.g. CYDY's LL drug does.^(2)\n3. RLF-100 is a natural peptide produced and used by the body to protect &amp; heal the lung and to      improve blood oxygenation. Severe CASES of COVID-19 have shown low levels of exactly this Peptide.^(3)\n\n*Clinical Data*\n\nCurrently there are 2 Clinical Trials underway and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Phase 2/3 Trial, IV RLF-100 for Critical COVID-19 Patients, Estimated completion in September 2020 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697) \n2. FDA granted IND for Clinical Trial of RLF-100 in inhaled version with the goal to provide a **preventive treatment at home** to prevent a moderate/severe COVID-19 infection.^(4) Estimated      completion in November [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096) \n3. FDA Intermediate Population Expanded Access of RLF-100, Expanded Access Program for cases too critical to be part of the above studies. In this EAP aims to treat the most critical COVID-19 Patient. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839) \n\nAll currently available Clinical Data regarding COVID-19 is from the Expanded Access. The first 21 Patients showed a Rapid recovery and a mortality reduction of over 90%. This patients consist out of the worst case COVID-19 cases like patients with combined double lung transplant rejection and severe COVID-19 infections. ^(3)\n\n*Summary:* \n\nRLF-100 blocks the COVID-19 Virus, prevents a zytokine storm, heals the lungs and improves blood oxygenation with a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most severe cases.\n\n*Further possible indications*\n\nPossible further indications for RLF-100 are almost all lung affecting diseases, as RLF-100 protects and heals the lungs. \n\nFurther RLF-100 acts on RANTES(CCL5) and could be indicated for treatment of HIV, Cancer and other RANTES specific diseases after further studies. \n\n**Current Demand / Demand for Expanded Access**\n\n\\- On behalf of Relief Therapeutics, NeuroRX is currently fielding multiple requests from representatives of health ministries, who would like to access RLF-100 for their countries. ^(7)\n\n\\- There is currently a high volume of requests for Expanded Access from US licensed physicians ^(8)\n\n**FDA Fast Track &amp; NeuroRX Partnership** \n\nRLFTF has a FDA Fast Track designation for the RLF-100 Drug 1 all clinical trials and studies are conducted by Relief Therapeutics partner NeuroRX, a privately held US Company. Relief Therapeutics own all rights on RLF-100 and pays NeuroRX to conduct the trials. ^(6)\n\n**Share Price Target** \n\nWhile it is difficult to determine a Share Price for a Stock which this Potential, my personal calculations put the potential between 5-20$. Analysis see the intermediate Share Price target at 18$ which would be a 3600% increase of the current Price. `9` \n\n**Catalysts in the near Future**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. In the Upcoming Days we expect an announcement of a Partnership with a large drug distribution and logistics Company. ^(10)\n2. A Board member of RLFTF saidduring an interview that by October they will be ready to deliver      treatment to 100'000 patients. ^(10)\n3. Study Results of the Phase 2/3 Study are due in September. Judged by the Expanded Access data, which treats more severe Cases than in the Study, the results are expected to be very good. ^(10)\n4. It is expected that the Data      Monitoring Committee might Stop the study and recommend an approval to the FDA, so that Patients from the Placebo control group can be treated as well.^(10)\n\n**Information about Market Cap, Outstanding Shares and Expected Earnings.**\n\nThere was a very comprehensive interview by a Swiss Investment Newspaper covering the Above topics, please check out [https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478](https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478) , it contains almost everything we want to know at this Point.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nI follow the clinical development of RLF-100 since the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 and i'm invested since early spring, i see myself as a long term investor. My primary investment motivation is that, after extensive reasearch over months, i believe in the potential of this drug.

        "selftext": "These times feel uneasy,  but this report will make you feel good. Here is some actual positive economic data to prove we are going up. There are many signs of growth in the underlying economy to justify today's valuations. One of the more important indicators, being the manufacturing index, was released this morning. \n\nYou can find the full report here:\n\n[https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/b8fe1953311a43c795488641e8b75bb7](https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/b8fe1953311a43c795488641e8b75bb7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKey findings:\n\n* Flash U.S. Composite Output Index at 54.7(50.3 in July).18-month high.\n* Flash U.S. Services Business  Activity  Index  at 54.8 (50.0 in July). 17-month high.\n* Flash U.S. Manufacturing  PMI  at 53.6 (50.9 in July). 19-month high.\n* Flash U.S. Manufacturing  Output  Index  at 53.9(51.7 in July).19-month high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;U.S. private sector firms signalled a strong upturn in business activity in August, with both manufacturers and   service   providers registering expansions. Notably,  it  marked the first  rise  in service  sector activity  since  the  start  of  the  year, while goods manufacturers recorded the   fastest   increase   in production since January 2019. Adjusted for seasonal factors, the IHS Markit Flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index posted 54.7 in August, up from 50.3 at the start of the third quarter and    signalled a    strong increase    in    output. Moreover,  it marked the  sharpest  upturn  in private sector business activity since February 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Driving  the  overall upturn in output  was  stronger client demand. Total new business rose for the first time    since    February and    at    a    solid    rate. Manufacturing firms registered a steeper expansion in  new  order  in flows than  in  July, while service providers signalled a  renewed increase  in sales. Companies  commonly  stated  that  new  business growth  stemmed  from  increased marketing  efforts and   the   resumption   of   client operations.   The reopening  of  economies worldwide also  helped to boost new   export   orders, with foreign   sales expanding at  the sharpest pace since  September 2014. Meanwhile, increased pressure on capacity and an associated upturn  in  outstanding  business  led  to a further expansion   of   workforce   numbers   across private  sector  firms  in  August.  The  rate  of job creation accelerated  among  service  providers,  with manufacturers   indicating   the   first   rise   in   staff numbers since February.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on this report, I would expect unemployment claims to drop next week and continue dropping. I would also expect the continued claims to decrease, and as they literally  said in the report - I would expect more new jobs to be posted. The numbers is in this report indicate we will rapidly return to our previous baseline from a manufacturing stand point, and likely surpass it. Obviously, the industrial sector and related industries are going to get a boost in the markets.\n\nAll this happy stuff aside, do not forget the debt it took to produce this will weigh heavily on the dollar and financial balance sheets for some time. This fact will be used to instill fear in investors. I fully expect ass-hat investment bankers and hedge fund managers to continue publishing the same fear mongering bullshit they do to try to induce a panic sell-off so they can buy in cheaper. JPM, WF, GS, and all other hedge funds literally spread fear in an attempt to drive prices down so they can buy in: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI)\n\nThis same perspective - that we are rapidly recovering - was also reiterated by the Fed in their FOMC minutes earlier this week (skip to the economic section): [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200729.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200729.htm). The Feds were astonished so see such a swift rate of recovery, but do acknowledge we have recovered about 1/3 of the payroll lost thus far and that they do need to continue their BRRR efforts as needed to ensure this recovery continues. We are on track to be \"recovered\" in a few quarters. Keep in mind the Feds wrote this report without access or knowledge of the manufacturing index report released this morning. \n\nOne final \"fuck you bears\" is that a lot of the recent growth and recovery happened in spite of the BRRR. The feds balance sheet was reduced by 200 billion:\n\n&gt;In light of improved conditions across these markets, the Federal  Reserve's balance sheet declined over the intermeeting period from $7.2  trillion to $7.0 trillion. The decline was driven by the reductions in  repo and U.S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding. These reductions more  than offset ongoing purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there is a pull back, buy that shit. We are not \"crashing\", or \"tanking\", we are going up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: suck it bears, buy calls, buy stocks.\n\nPositions: I own stock in AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, ARKF, VTI, VUG, QQQ, and I'm eyeing some calls for Monday (no specifics yet). I also like doggy style and anal.",

        "selftext": "I wrote this shit up to rake in some \u20acuropoors so I could feed my cat just to realize you can't instantly publish random shit on Seeking Alpha (the site did the best to cause that impression) so here we go:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFollowing a series of either positive (Ampere) or at least interesting (ARM) news, NVIDIA's stock has run as hot as it can possibly get over the past few weeks, almost climbing as high as $500 a share.  NVIDIA will report their earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 today after the bell. This report will define whether or not the very ambitious valuation of NVIDIA is - for now - justified or not. Let's attempt an educated guess at the numbers they're going to report tonight.\n\n**Data Center - $1900M**\n\nThe data center segment has been the major growth driver for NVIDIA since late 2016. Back then, they reported $240M revenue for Q3 of fiscal 2017. This boosted the stock by 50% in a matter of weeks. Since then this segment has been under close observation by analysts and NVIDIA has been aggressively growing it as much as they can. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang is saying that data center is now a $100B market and expects it to grow to $1T in the coming years. Last quarter NVIDIA reported a record $1,141M data center revenue. Their new superstar AI-accelaretor, the A100, already contributed to that quarter, yet it was still very new to the market. According to their last report the A100 will have solid visibility in Q2. Almost more importantly, starting\u00a0with Q2, data center will incorporate Mellanox revenue, which was\u00a0$429M last quarter. This means that had Mellanox revenue already been included last quarter, NVIDIA's data center revenue would already have surpassed their revenue from gaming. [In a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY61ExKhnfA) NVIDIA demonstrated the construction of Selene, the world's 7th fastest supercomputer. [Their A100 dominated AI benchmarking against competitors.](https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/29/nvidia-sets-16-new-performance-records-latest-mlperf-ai-benchmarks/)\u00a0The strength of the A100 combined with the inclusion of Mellanox' revenue should skyrocket their revenue from data center up to almost $2B.\n\n**Gaming - $1600M**\n\nThis quarter will be the last one of the Turing generation. You'd think that consumers would be aware of that fact and that they'd be reluctant to buy any hardware that will be obsolete within weeks. Yet demand for Turing cards, fueled by covid, has been very strong. Despite the release of NVIDIA's next high end card being a matter of weeks if not days, people are still buying used (!) 2080 tis for $1000 and above. The 2070 super ($500-600) has seen high demand and competitor AMD has not managed to make much of a dent in NVIDIA's revenue. Buyers of the RX 5700 XT reported serious driver problems, further confirming NVIDIA as the brand you go for if you want things to \"just work\". Moreover, NVIDIA has built 2 more USPs in DLSS 2.0 (AI upscaling) and RTX Voice (AI noise cancelling) in this quarter to which competition has no answer yet. Consumers describe these features as \"black magic\" and the premium for RTX cards is finally being accepted. Big graphic intense game releases such as Microsoft's Flight Simulator and Cyberpunk 2077 (delayed but upcoming) further helped demand for gaming GPUs. In Q2 of FY 2020 NVIDIA reported\u00a0$1,313M revenue from gaming, a number they should handily beat this quarter.\n\n**Automotive - $120M**\n\nLast quarter, revenue from automotive came it at $155 million which was the lowest number since quite a few quarters. NVIDIA is by no means giving up this segment, they are determined to becoming a major player in the self driving car revolution. In June, they announced a close partnership with Daimler. Starting 2024 [every single next-gen Mercedes-Benz](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/06/23/mercedes-benz-nvidia-software-defined-vehicles/) vehicle will include hardware and software from NVIDIA. While this is a great outlook, it does not help the upcoming earnings release a lot. Due to covid, NVIDIA expects revenue from the automotive segment to decline by 50%. The recent success of Tesla is helping NVIDIA in this sector, as Tesla has successfully been applying pressure on the \"dinosaurs\" of the car industry. As Tesla is building their own hardware and software for their autopilot, traditional car makers have fallen too far behind to catch up in time and have to rely on partners like NVIDIA to survive.\n\n**Professional Visualization - $340M**\n\nRelative to the rest of NVIDIA's business, ProViz has been growing very slowly, but yet steadily. What speaks against strong numbers from their ProViz business is that Turing is on it's way out. The same was the case 2 years ago with Pascal and yet NVIDIA reported a solid $281M revenue in this segment. Combine this with the fact that covid has been boosting demand due to heavily increased home office working, a solid increase in revenue can be expected.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThese guesses add up to a revenue of close to $4B. NVIDIA's guidance for this quarter was $3.65B. If this attempt at a guess of NVIDIA's revenue ends up being correct, the stock's current valuation would gain strong support. There are more factors that could come into play tonight. Play close attention to any of the following:\n\n* Any information regarding a potential purchase of ARM from SoftBank\n* Guidance for H2 data center revenue\n* A potential announcement of a stock split",

That said, we have started to see an increase in weekly wholesale orders on a sequential basis, which is an encouraging sign that demand for our brand in the wholesale channel remains strong despite the challenges facing physical retail. The increase in DTC orders allowed us to work through a substantial portion of the inventory we had on hand at the end of March and generate a meaningful amount of cash in April, along with the collection of the majority of our wholesale partner receivables under existing contract terms. And our cash preservation actions, cash and cash equivalents increased $36.1 million, or 137%, to $62.5 million at April 30, compared with $26.4 million at March 31.\n\n**May sales from June Press release**\n\n&gt;Business Update \u2013 May 2020  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u25cf\tMay 2020 Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) orders increased 125% to approximately $71 million compared with the same month last year driven by growth in mattresses and bases as well as ancillary products including pillows, sheets, and seat cushions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u25cf\tMay wholesale orders were $17.3 million, a decline of less than 2% year-over-year, compared to down 43% in April as more wholesale doors reopened and weekly orders have increased on a sequential basis.

That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I am a 29M and still in school pursuing a PhD in the USA. I have no student loans/cc debt etc.  I am living off a stipend, but I manage to put aside $600 each month to invest. I just started investing a couple of months ago and since I am not confident about what I am doing, I opened two brokerage accounts, one with Robinhood and the other with Chase. The Chase account is an \u201caggressive\u201d (meaning approx. 90% stocks) portfolio account, in which the bank handles my entire portfolio and I simply put money in it every month. The RH account is, of course, handled by me. My idea is to continue this for a year or two and ultimately consolidate all my money into one account and close the other one, depending on which performs better. \n\nIn my RH account I have/planning to have the following stocks:\n\n**Technology:** GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, BABA, INTC, TSM, QCOM, NVDA\n\n**Finance:**  BAC, JPM, PYPL, BRK.B, V, AXP, C\n\n**Communications:** T, VZ\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:** PG, MCD, WMT, DIS, KO\n\n**Industrial:** BA, LMT, DAL, AER\n\n**Healthcare:** JNJ, UNH\n\nI do not plan to invest in ETFs as of now since I am young and able to take risks. Out of the $600 I am investing each month, $300 goes to my Chase investment account and $300 goes to my RH account. I am planning to DCA by investing an equal amount in each of the stock I own in RH, so I would like to own no more than 30 stocks, preferably 25.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is my strategy of having an RH account and another investing account with Chase a good one? Or should I just stick to one or the other from the get-go? Will having two investment accounts be an issue when I file my taxes?\n\n2) Does my portfolio look good? Am I well / over-diversified? Am I missing some obvious sectors? I think I might end up with way too many similar companies e.g. INTC, TSM, QCOM, and NVDA which is not really diversification. Maybe I should just pick one out of all such companies?\n\nAny other advice/comments about my portfolio are welcome. TIA!",

        "selftext": " \n\nAlright nerds buckle in.\n\nI see a distinct lack of defence contractors and in particular aerospace defence posted on here. Y'all are pussies. Guaranteed tendies as war is eternal. The big boys are set for the most part. LMT has JSF income for the next forever, NOC has B-21 which is going great. Boeing can't seem to unfuck itself which is good news for what I'm about to talk about.\n\nThe Air Force is sick and tired of procurement cycles that last multiple decades. They're feeling very burnt by the cancellation of F-22 production now that we need a modern 5th gen air superiority fighter. The F-35 is looking to finally be proving its worth, but the AF and DOD at large are looking to avoid that sort of 20+ year contract next time around. The murmurs about the \"Digital Century Series\" are indicative of this.\n\nIn the near term, we need to ensure air superiority and dominance, with our limited number of Air Superiority Fighters. The F-35 is good enough to partially bridge the gap, but we need to try new things to make it more effective. That's where Skyborg comes in.\n\nAF Big Safari, AF Research Lab, and the Rapid Capabilities Office have been spearheading programs lately designed to streamline the procurement process and get capabilities fielded in a fraction of the time it'd normally take. They have a huge role in the B-21 and they're a major reason why it's going so smoothly and why I'm so enthusiastic about Skyborg. They've had a project called \"Loyal Wingman\" in development for a little bit and it's been quietly making successful tests. Here's an old article about it. [https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/10475/usaf-research-lab-has-released-this-image-of-its-low-cost-stealthy-drone](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/10475/usaf-research-lab-has-released-this-image-of-its-low-cost-stealthy-drone)\n\nLoyal Wingman is basically the idea of a sidekick drone that carries weapons, sensors, and is smart enough to mostly handle itself. A few would be paired with every fighter and they would be used to augment its capabilities, giving it better situational awareness and even being capable of suiciding itself to take out a target that might be too heavily defended for a manned aircraft. It's since been largely rolled in to a program dubbed \"Skyborg.\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtUxfFaYAPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtUxfFaYAPs) is a video.\n\nThere are three contractors who were awarded contracts to vie for the big skyborg contract. It's looking to be a $400M+ contract for the first winner. Only one will get it. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TENDIES.\n\n1. Boeing. Their product is probably pretty good and it's likely to win Australia's Skyborg contract. But it's ABSOLUTELY not going to win the AF's competition. Why? Boeing FUCKED their reputation with the AF. The KC-46 program is FUCKED beyond belief and big daddy AF is NOT HAPPY. Ignore the small F-15EX orders, they're political bones thrown to senators and congressmen. They were handed a SURE THING contract for the AF's next Tanker, and they went out of their way to fuck it up. Seriously, I can't state how much of an inconvenience this has been to the pentagon and how much it will continue to be for the next decade or so. For an AF program where rapid development and delivery is paramount, they're lucky they got this far. Their ONLY hope is Trump makes the pentagon choose them.\n2. Northrop Grumman. The winners of the B-21 competition are in a good position, but I've heard literally nothing about their Skyborg proposal, other than they're looking to team up with small startups. I do know that the B-21 program is eating up a lot of their attention at the moment, especially as we get close to delivery of the first few production models, and their unveiling. It's a hush-hush program. My understanding is AFRL is looking towards smaller contractors though, so I'd lean away from NG.\n3. General Atomics: Private company, who cares. They make the Reaper and Predator. Not exciting. Moving on\n4. Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. They WILL WIN the contract. They've got good relationships with the AF and DOD at large. They primarily have made target drones before and have a reputation as a company that delivers with minimal fuss. They've got their fingers in a bunch of low profile pies. [Lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/SEQ-3_Laser_Weapon_System), [Satellite management](https://www.satellitetoday.com/government-military/2020/05/04/kratos-receives-contract-to-monitor-space-force-bandwidth/), [Target Drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_Engineering_BQM-167_Skeeter) and more. Their Financials are [sound](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KTOS/financials?p=KTOS), they consistently outperform estimated eps and the shitty robin hood advisers say it's a 100% buy. Their proposed drone, the XQ-58 Valkyrie has been in testing for a little bit and has hit its targets smoothly, with their whole development going incredibly well for a defence program. [Their drone](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26825/air-forces-secretive-xq-58a-valkyrie-experimental-combat-drone-emerges-after-first-flight) seems to be able to hit the AFRL/AF's cost targets as well, because it's basically a commercial target drone in a fancy suit. There was even an F-15 [spotted testing](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/34982/highly-modified-air-launched-loyal-wingman-drone-tested-with-air-force-f-15-eagle) with a Kratos target drone acting as a loyal wingman/skyborg testbed, reflecting how far along the program is and the level of AF involvement. They're going to win. Mostly because their product is the better one, but partly because the DOD doesn't want Boeing to win and NG is too busy to take this on.\n\nCompetition winner will likely be announced October, if my crystal ball isn't completely miscalibrated. I don't have insider info, but I do have a bunch of airplane nerd friends who all agree that the XQ-58 WILL WIN. A win for KTOS will likely see their stock price jump, possibly independent of the rest of the market as their market really isn't the civilian market. This will also position them well for future contracts and they are more than capable of picking them up.\n\nAlso, their name is cool.\n\nThey were in a dip today, buy now.\n\nMy play? 1/15/21 $30 Call. I don't have the money to make zillions off of this, but hopefully one of you will let me ride in your lambo.\n\nIf I'm wrong then I'll do something I don't want to do, idk haven't decided yet.",

        "selftext": "Thanks to Tesla the EV market has been getting a lot of attention in the past few months. Many retail investors are pilling into EV scams (NKLA) or overpriced SPACS like (SPAQ, HCAC, etc...). These companies don't have working vehicles, they depend on press releases to pump the stock and investors are constantly diluted for no reason.\n\nMeanwhile, many institutional investors are securing positions in different companies that have a high chance in becoming big players in the EV revolution. Solid companies with defined plans, realistic goals, working products and real factories.\n\n*July 09, 2020:* ([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/)) *Arcimoto, Inc.\u00ae, (NASDAQ: FUV) today announced the* ***entry into agreements with institutional investors relating to the sale of 1,370,000 shares of*** **its common stock at an above market offering price, pursuant to NASDAQ rules, of $7.30 per share.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/72r2hivr8tg51.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146bdfbff1dcb25ab76d32c83affe7fb03dbaceb\n\n**VARIETY OF PREMIUM VEHICLES**\n\n* **Fun Utility Vehicle (FUV).** Designed for individual transportation (two-seat). Mark Wahlberg recently bought one and he loves it. [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFBAZH4qGjU&amp;t=117s) He liked so much that he also got a delivery fleet for his restaurants \"[Wahlburgers](https://twitter.com/arcimoto/status/1285974987367755776)\".\n* **DELIVERATOR**. Designed for delivery. The vehicle has tons of space and can be used by restaurants do deliver large meals, by supermarkets to deliver groceries or by individual drivers that participate in the growing \"GIG ECONOMY\". [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BS5r_7710)\n* **Rapid Responder**. Designed for first responders, law enforcement and campus security. Improving response times and reducing carbon emissions all at once. [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgUNxakqvxw)\n\n**BASIC INFORMATION**\n\n* Located in Oregon. MADE IN THE USA\n* **Started trading in the NASDAQ 3 years ago at $6.50 a share.** The company was founded in 2007. Currently the stock is trading at $7.75\n* The company officially launched production and delivery on September 19, 2019.\n* World\u2019s first premium FUV, the Evergreen Edition, **has an affordable MSRP of $19,900 before gas savings, available tax credits, and rebates**\n* Company reported a backlog of more than 4,000 pre orders ($75M in revenue).\n\n**CURRENTLY WORKING WITH SANDY MUNRO TO GO FULL SCALE PRODUCTION**\n\n* Munro and Arcimoto. [PREVIEW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8yV99P7Tx0)\n* For those who don't know Sandy Munro: [https://sandymunro.net/bio.html](https://sandymunro.net/bio.html). Basically he is the go to guy for big automobile companies, he's highly respected in the automobile industry.\n* Munro &amp; Associates are evaluating the program to determine how much will the vehicle cost to produce at large scale so they can know the exact cost and avoid production problems.\n* Define a clear path to make Arcimoto vehicles profitable.\n\n**Q1 2020 HIGLIGHTS**\n\n[**FULL Q1 CALL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh8jO7xpuVQ&amp;t=807s)\n\n* They have applied for a federal ATVM loan **(ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY VEHICLES MANUFACTURING LOAN PROGRAM).** They plan to scale up with the proceeds of those funds with non diluting funding and become profitable in the next 18 months. [AVTM LOAN PROGRAM](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/title-xvii/products-services/advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program) (they worked very hard to meet all of the requirements)\n* **They wanted to have production experience before going big.** With 6 months of real production under their belt and a much clear picture of what capital expenditures and additional space will take to scale up manufacturing **they finally completed the ATVM draft, they are in the review process and are planning to submit the draft to the Department of Energy in the coming weeks.** This is from 11 June 2020\n* According to [Inside Evs](https://insideevs.com/news/339045/if-you-dont-watch-this-arcimoto-q2-video-youll-regret-it/) **the loan could reach $100M. This would be a game changer for the company because this loans are very generous with financing terms.**\n* Max daily output with the current facility: Around 3,000 vehicles. They want to focus on the high margin vehicles and become profitable.\n* **If they get the ATVM loan they want to achieve a yearly output of 17,000-20,000 vehicles.** Given the current economic situation and stimulus money going everywhere, the CEO believes they have a high chance of getting the loan relatively quickly.\n\n**FINAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n* The company is loved by the current shareholders. **Companies with cult following can be very profitable.** Long term investors reduce the float because they hold for the long term giving the company a lot of momentum when positive news happen because nobody sells.\n* The company has been working very hard for over a decade to have a perfect working vehicle once they go into full scale production. The CEO is very smart and transparent.\n* They tested the production line with low volume (low thousands per year) to avoid unnecessary costs and production problems. **Now they are ready for the next step.**\n* Having someone as Munro planning the production and preventing mistakes once full scale production starts is extremely bullish. [MUNRO &amp; ARCIMOTO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8yV99P7Tx0)\n* They are focusing on the DELIVERATOR given the growing trend of deliveries and many people joining the \"GIG ECONOMY\"\n* They only have 6M in debt.\n* **24% short interest**\n* **They raised money in June above market price (investors are willing to pay a premium to buy large blocks of shares)**\n* 40% owned by insiders\n* Q2 2020 in 6 days\n\n**TL;DR:** Premium EV company with virtually no competition in the FUV space with different WORKING vehicles (personal transportation, delivery and first responders). Planning on going full scale with an [ATVM loan](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/title-xvii/products-services/advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program) they applied and waiting for approval. Ideally they want to raise production to 17,000-20,000 vehicles once they get the loan. I think we can expect big news during the Q2 call.\n\n**POSITIONS:** 8/21 10C (40 contracts at $0.50)\n\n*(Will buy some LEAPS if I get burned with the FDs)*",

        "selftext": "I and many of you will have spent the last 48 hours reading nothing but bearish articles about how the market is fucked and how we are going to have a civil war. Many hours will have been spent looking at stats comparing the current index charts to 1929 1987 and 2000. Then..... futures will in fact open slightly down....maybe theyll even go down as far as .97% overnight, and all of us will sleep well with our little bearish pussies slightly wet in anticpation of the possibility that tomorrow will be a limit down for old-time's sake.\n\nWe'll wake up at 1am and then 2 am and 2:59 am to relieve our swollen prostates and bladders almost cummming seeing futures down even marginally. We'll check wsb for news. There wont be any. Some of us will wake up again at 3:35 to see that Europoors have bought the dip....just slightly. Again we will check for news. There will be nothing that we understand, or anything that we can see as consequential, but we will go back to bed and chock up the pump to europoor opening. Then many of us will wake up for the day around 7-730 to pretend like we are going to drink coffee and do legit market anal-sis for a few hours before market opens. We will see futures flat and possibly even green on no news, and our put positions will have been eaten by 3 days of theta. \n\nMarket will open, and we will see red candles out of the gate....deep ones. making new lows. We will see our -90% puts recover 5% and so we wont sell them as our bear pussies soak up the red bull blood. We'll watch...possibly even add more puts...0 dtes....cuz this is it, this is the rug pull! SPY will fall past that generational 350 support, and we will be cumming all over our screens like Randy Marsh in South Park. SPY will rollover, order book will be blood fucking red......and then out of no where, from SPY 349.43 or some other random non meaningful level, the v-shape recovery will begin. \n\nIt  cant go all the way back up we'll think as we wipe down our computers with that sock that everyone has...Ill just hold a little more and see what happens. \n\nThe green will slow and we'll think....Arite its -.001%....thats the re-test, here cums the dump...and it will...just enough to make it look like its dead, but not enough for our puts to gain any value. We'll scream in frustration. Some of us will even sell. Many will hold...why not, we'll say...already down 95%? \n\nThen, magically, Spy will turn green on the day. Brighter and brighter. We'll furiously check WSB to see if theres any possible fucking reason for it....all we'll see is bulltard perma-sheep jerking each other off and yelling bear r fuk and printer go brrr and ....stonks (gayest meme btw).\n\nAnd tomorrow, Monday 8/31, 2020 will be just like any other Monday where the D will be B'd and Bears will get cucked. \n\nGood day.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 31st, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks head into September in high gear as Apple and Tesla split, and markets await the August jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/stocks-start-september-in-high-gear-as-apple-and-tesla-split-and-markets-await-the-august-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; September is historically challenging for the market, but stocks could start the month on an upswing after what looks to be the best August for the S&amp;P 500 in at least 34 years.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead will be busy with Fed speakers and economic reports, including the important August employment count Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 9 a.m. ET Monday on monetary policy. He is is one of several officials, who are expected to reiterate Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole message that the Fed would be willing to let inflation run hot temporarily to help the economy and job market.\n*****\n&gt; The low volume days of late summer should be a hallmark of the week ahead, but there could also be window dressing trades around the month\u2019s end, as investors rebalance holdings.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, there could be some excitement around two of the market\u2019s favorite stocks. Apple begins trading after a 4-for-1 split. Tesla is also trading on a split-adjusted basis starting Monday, after it split its stock 5-for-1. Apple\u2019s split changes its weight in the Dow, so the index is being adjusted and there will be new names in the index Monday as some old ones leave. ExxonMobil, Pfizer and Raytheon will be replaced by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% in the past week, and it could continue to make gains in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we\u2019re still going to be basking in the the glow of an accommodative Fed, combined with the increased accessibility of Apple\u2019s share price to retail investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said that after its last split in 2014, Apple gained 36% over the next year, but after its 2000 split as the tech bubble burst, it lost 60%. Apple has risen more than 30% since announcing its stock split on July 30.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was on track for a more than 6.9% gain in August, its best performance since 1986 if it holds that level through Monday. The S&amp;P recovered and surpassed its all time high during the month and is now flirting with the psychological 3,500 area.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs\n&gt; Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,\u201d Markowska said. \u201cAt the same time, you\u2019re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there\u2019s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there\u2019s no bridge for the next six months,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed message\n&gt; After Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole symposium Thursday, Treasury yields moved in a wide range. The 10-year note was as low as 0.65% and as high as 0.78% Friday, before settling in at about 0.74% in afternoon trading Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Powell said the Fed would be willing to let inflation rise a bit above 2% for awhile, and that it would now target an average without moving to tighten policy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market reaction to Powell was a little confusing. I suspect the Fed did not want to see this back-up in nominal yields and I suspect they\u2019ll push against it,\u201d said Markowska.\n*****\n&gt; Fed watchers said the message from Powell was that the Fed will likely keep rates lower for a longer period. Bond strategists said the market was responding to the idea of higher inflation, and rates were rising, particularly at the long end of the curve.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TLHe03j.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TfUKyzr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/4yWqZND.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/LXBYRb7C/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oQ3yHrS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VD6IBme.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YaBzNQp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/f3VmrXB.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/3xk18bTX/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/VNGzq6TQ/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/d1hw4FP7/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Dzy24sxP/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Worlds Apart\n\n&gt; If you've been paying attention this year, you know that the S&amp;P 500 has been carried by the performance of the index's largest components, and the chart below illustrates just how wide the disparity has been. It shows the YTD performance of each of the S&amp;P 500's members sorted by their market cap heading into 2020 with the largest stocks on the left side and the smallest stocks on the right. So far this year, the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.3% YTD, and if we were to take an even narrower look at just the ten largest stocks heading into the year, the average YTD gain is over 27%!\n\n&gt; While the largest stocks are up a lot this year, the next 400 stocks in terms of market cap haven't fared nearly as well, averaging a decline of 2.0%. That's not great, but considering the pandemic this year, even a 2% decline isn't such a bad thing. The same can't be said for the smallest stocks in the S&amp;P, however. As shown below, the 50 smallest stocks are down an average of 15.3% YTD, and more than two-thirds of them are down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827-Individual-stocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Another way to illustrate the declining fortunes of stocks this year based on their size is by looking at a moving average of YTD stock performance across the market cap spectrum, In the chart below, the first point on the chart represents the performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 which have gained an average of 11.3% YTD. The next point to the right represents the average YTD change of the stocks that ranked between number 2 and 51 in terms of market cap at the start of 2020, and we continue that process down the entire list of components to the point where the last point in the series on the right side of the chart represents the average performance of the 50 smallest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 heading into the year. As mentioned above, that group of stocks has averaged a decline of 15.3% YTD. The performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 ranks as the fourth-best of 451 different points on the chart, while the basket of the 50 smallest stocks ranks as the 29th worst performing basket. In 2020, the bigger the stock, the better the returns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827moving-average-YTD-performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Which Bull Will It Be?\n\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 bear market bottom continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 50% from those fateful lows. It feels like a lifetime since the longest bull market ever ended. Remember though, although the recent bull market was the longest, it wasn\u2019t the greatest, as the 1990s bull gained more on a percentage basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We discussed in detail what the new highs in the S&amp;P 500 meant here, so we won\u2019t dive into that again. But this time we\u2019ll show just how this rally ranks versus others that ended major bear markets. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this new bull market, up to this point of about five months, is stronger than any other major bull market\u2019s start going back to World War II.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYes, this new bull market is the strongest bull market we\u2019ve ever seen after five months,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t be a source of worry. The previous two strongest rallies up to this point were in 1982 and 2009, and both saw continued strength during the first year of the new bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here is a chart showing just this bull market and the \u201982 and \u201909 bull markets.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 28th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcH7UWUfQn4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.31.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.31.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HLV3Hxj.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.31.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HLWoNcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.1.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4MRPa7I.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7dhII3i.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TROOwoH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L9FYSJe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7f5D5B7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4jUOy0x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.4.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # T.B.A THIS WEEKEND.\n&gt; **T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.** T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "Goldman hosted a virtual investor meeting yesterday with $DAL\\* CEO Ed Bastian and CFO Paul Jacobson. The discussions focused on demand recovery and the company's ability to adapt costs to the uncertain demand outlook. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n1. Commenting on the current demand environment, management noted that this has held relatively steady at down \\~75% year-over-year for the last four to six weeks, underlying which business demand remains down a more depressed -86% to -88% year-over-year. However, more recently the company has seen a very modest uptick in bookings, likely driven in part by the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend. Given that bookings remain relatively close-in, the company does not currently have much clarity around fall demand, but expects to have a better view post-Labor Day.\n2. Due to ongoing demand uncertainty, the company remains committed to its flexible planning approach. Currently, Delta\u2019s planning guardrails are for summer 2021 capacity to be down 20% to 40% vs. 2019 levels. If the demand recovery by summer 2021 requires a capacity cut of greater than 40%, the company believes there is room to flex down further. However, if demand were to recover in a more V-shaped fashion than most airline managements and we believe is likely, it would be difficult for Delta to cut capacity less than 20% given previously announced headcount reductions and aircraft retirements.\n3. Delta anticipates that its unit costs (\u201cCASM\u201d) coming out of the crisis will be lower than pre-COVID levels given various cost savings across the organization, including labor and the fleet. On the former, the company highlighted that 17,000 employees, or \\~20% of its workforce, have already elected to participate in voluntary retirement/separation programs. The majority of participants in these programs were more senior and therefore at the higher end of the pay scale, which should result in lower labor costs even as Delta/the industry scale back up as demand recovers, further aided by productivity gains the company is planning to leverage. With respect to fleet-driven savings, management highlighted its previously announced aircraft retirement plans would accelerate its fleet simplification process and reduce expenses going forward tied to improved fuel burn, fewer training events, reduced spare parts inventory, etc.\n4. With Delta planning for both capacity and costs to be down \\~50% year-over-year in the Dec Q, the company continues to anticipate that further cash burn improvement will largely hinge on demand. However, management commented that potential further fleet simplification actions could drive additional costs out of the business.\n5. Delta reiterated that it does not currently plan to draw on its loan allocation under the current CARES Act given the associated restrictions and as it has other options to raise additional liquidity if necessary. Looking forward, there have been discussions of a potential airline provision in a new proposed stimulus package (or \u201cCARES 2\u201d), which could include an extension of the Payroll Support Program (currently slated to end September 30th). Management noted that these discussions, which started out as a union-driven initiative, have bipartisan support in the US government and that a relatively larger CARES 2 package would increase the likelihood of the airlines provision being included.\n6. Management currently does not plan to back away from its long-standing strategy to strengthen its global network through partnerships with various international airlines. Instead, management believes cooperation between Delta and its global partners may actually accelerate as a result of the pandemic.",

Ever since the Cyber Truck, his clout has been slowly going down and down. \n\nScience nerds used to love this guy because he was all about Autonomous driving and going to Mars and Hyperloops etc. That hype trickled down to normies and now even the retards here on WSB worship him like he invented electricity. \n\nBut now that hype is dying down. It's been dying down among hardcore nerds for a while. The Hyperloop was shown to be a dumb idea [pretty much immediately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNFesa01llk) and [continues to be dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6Cz4hwuEI&amp;t=1025s), but now is also very well funded.

        "selftext": "Ok, so you know how Apple has been mooning on news of the iPhone 12, and ARM MacBooks, which has totally screwed over INTC and made TSM and other suppliers to AAPL moon?\n\n(Here's the background info in case you missed the news [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY))\n\nApple was actually approached by Softbank to buy ARM but they couldn't due to ARM licensing stuff out to competitors as well, and Apple obviously has a very private philosophy too so that wouldn't work. But, they will continue to use chipsets based on ARM's architecture for the future macbooks/iphones as well ([https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/](https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/)). But if you just follow the money, and try to find out who actually will OWN ARM, the offer has come from none other than Nvidia, and the deal to buy ARM is all but confirmed. (seeck ingalpha.com/article/4370499-chippening-part-2-nvidia-reaches-for-outstretched-arm). And I'm sure that most of you are aware of how AAPL is trying to expand its reach into countries like India for the first time offering first-party stores and an online store, etc. This will only increase their sales numbers, and Apple will only get more bullet proof from hereon. The real story here, is in NVDA.\n\nWhen they do end up buying ARM, the merger will either be seen as A.) a value destroying buy that wasn't worth it or B.) A merger of epic proportions that inserts Nvidia into the mobile and CPU market \"Apple recently indicated it would change their use of Intel chips in Mac computers to custom made ARM-based chips. This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets.\n\nNVIDIA is not currently a major competitor in the smartphone and tablet business, so acquiring ARM would expand it into new realms where ARM happens to dominate. NVIDIA did previously attempt to compete in this business, but its Tegra chips never got much market share.\"\n\nMost of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&amp;D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer. Their Cash per share has grown insanely :\n\nCash Per Share ratio has gone up from 2 to 17.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd they have low long term debt that has barely increased, but their assets have remarkably increased, which means a low lt debt/asset ratio, just showing you how much of a powerhouse NVDA is.\n\nLT debt/total assets has decreased, total long term debt hasn't increased since last year\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only that, but along with decreasing/flatlining long term debt, they have a negative cash conversion cycle, which greatly reduces opex. Financially, this is only the beginning of their buildup. Aside from just solid financials for such a revolutionary company, they have revolutionary products. Their cloud services and acquisition of Mellanox will only expand their bases. Nvidia has a vision, and it may be very far-out and hard to accomplish or it may be the most genius thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure how long this'll take to work itself out, but I wouldn't fear buying March 2021 740 calls.\n\nTl;dr NVDA LEAPS or shares",

        "selftext": "# Rationale\n\nI have seen some posts here wondering about the wisdom of investing in Wealthsimple's parent company, Power Corporation of Canada (POW.TO). I decided to look more into this, decided to post my research on why I, long-term, I have a very bullish view on WS (and by extension POW.TO), and why I think this is equal to being an early stage investor in a WS IPO.\n\nNote: I'm aware of the main criticisms that POW.TO is a mature company and dividend stock that has been trading sideways for many years, and the fact that WS is currently not a profitable company. I am not a professional investor, and this is just my amateur research, so I certainly welcome any comments/criticism of this thesis that people on this subreddit might have! (**Please be gentle on me).**\n\n# Overview\n\n* **Name**: Wealthsimple (WS) ([Crunchbase Profile](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wealthsimple))\n* **Founded**: 2014\n* **Ownership**: Power Corporation of Canada (POW.TO) (83.2% ownership)\n* **Assets** **Under** **Mangement**: $5.4 billion, as of June 30, 2020 (4.9 billion in June 30, 2019)\n\n# Current Products\n\n* **Wealthsimple Invest** (ETF Roboadvisor service), WS was one of the first-movers in this space in Canada and offered robo-advising as part of its initial product in 2015. WS claims to have largest digital investing presence in Canada (70% of the market) ([reference](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/02/how-canadas-wealthsimple-is-building-a-whole-financial-suite/)).\n* **Wealthsimple Cash**, a savings account service\n* **Wealthsimple Trade**, a commission free trading app where users can buy and sell \\~8,000 stocks and ETFs\n* **Wealthsimple Crypto**, a commission free cryptocurrency trading app, currently in beta\n* [**SimpleTax.ca**](https://SimpleTax.ca), a free tax-return service used by \\~1 million Canadians per year, acquired in late 2019\n\n# Investment Rounds\n\nWS has had many successful rounds of funding and a vote of confidence from both its parent POW.TO and other multinationals investing in fintech.\n\n* Last year WS received a $100 million dollar investment led by Allianz X, the start up investor arm of German financial services giant Allianz\n* WS has had 7 total investing rounds, totalling $266.9 million ([reference](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wealthsimple/company_financials))\n\n# Growth\n\nWS has been extremely aggressive in targeting growth areas. Wealthsimple\u2019s CEO Mike Katchen has said he wants to position the company as a \u201cfull-stack\u201d financial services company. Here are some of their current expansion areas:\n\n* **UK and USA Expansion** \\- in 2017, they started offering similar investing services in the UK and the US ([reference](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/uk-launch) and [reference](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/us-launch)).\n* **Socially Responsible ETFs** \\- WS recently partnered with Mackenzie Investment to offer socially responsible ETFs with a social and environmental focus. Although probably not something that older investors care about, this is particularly important for younger investors who want to make sure their investments are socially responsible\n* **Cryptocurrency** \\- WS is currently testing a beta service of their cryptocurrency app, and offering fee-free cryptocurrency trading, similar to Wealthsimple Trade. Although I can't predict. Whatever your views of cryptocurrency (I'm of the view that I can be part of a portfolio to hedge against risk), it's here to stay. Earlier this month, WS was the first company in Canada to register with the Ontario Securities Exchange Commission ([reference](https://twitter.com/OSC_News/status/1291772769378676740/photo/1)). My sense is that crypto will face increasing regulations and scrutiny in the coming years, which will be a good thing for WS which is a step ahead of the game ([reference](https://www.mackenzieinvestments.com/en/media-centre/press-releases/_2020/2020-june-16-mackenzie-investments-partners-with-wealthsimple-to-launch-socially-responsible-etfs)). Even Google is starting to look into relaxing its restraints on crypto ([reference](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/20/08/17160547/google-opens-the-door-to-mass-cryptocurrency-adoption))\n* **Other full-stack services** \\- WS has been mum on what other services they might offer, but insurance could be another area of disruption\n\n# People\n\nWS is run by young guys who have big ambitions and plans for the company. Sometimes there are CEOs with the intangibles that can really drive a company's growth, and from what I can glean, I think the company has a lot of potential here in terms of vision by its leaders. You can read more about the [founders here](https://opmwars.substack.com/p/the-wealthsimple-founders-before)\n\n* **Michael Katchen,** CEO, Background: Led product and marketing at a start up called 1000memories, a Y Combinator startup later acquired by [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com). Worked for McKinsey &amp; Company.\n* **Brett Huneycutt**, COO, Rhodes Scholar... not much else I know about the guy\n\nQuote from CEO: Michael Katchen\n\n&gt;Within the last month, Wealthsimple has also opened an office in London. Katchen said a push into the European market is \u201cpossible\u201d as its \u201cambitions are global,\u201d but right now the Canadian and U.S. markets are \u201ca lot to chew.\u201d It is a far cry from the company\u2019s early days: \\*\\*Katchen said he was \u201claughed out of the boardroom\u201d for laying out a global vision for Wealthsimple at a time when they had just $1.9-million in funding and 20 users.\\*\\* \u201cIt\u2019s a very personal mission of mine since I moved back from California, to inspire more Canadian companies to think big and to think internationally about the businesses that they\u2019re building,\u201d he said. ([reference](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/national-post-latest-edition/20170131/282157880973513))\n\n# Brand Value and Design\n\nOut of all the financial services company in Canada, WS probably has the most cohesive and smart design concept across its platforms and products. I see the value in Wealthsimple in not just the assets they have under management, but also the value of the brand itself. I mean, what kind of financial services company makes a [blog post about their branding colour scheme](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/new-wealthsimple-15) and font choices? Also see: Wealthsimple\u2019s advertisement earlier this year capturing 4 million views on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fypQIkUKgUE&amp;feature=emb_title).\n\nThere also seems to be very strong brand awareness and brand loyalty amongst its users. I think a lot of users find WS refreshing as a financial services company because they cut through the \"bullshit\" and legalese, and try to simply things for the consumer. They also have their own in house team of designers and creative directors to do branding, design, and advertising, and this kind of vertical integration is generally unheard of in the financial services industry ([reference](https://strategyonline.ca/2020/01/07/wealthsimple-tells-its-origin-story-as-it-prepares-for-the-future/)).\n\n# Potential IPO?\n\nInterestingly, the CEO\u2019s ultimate goal is to take the company public. Therefore, I see an investment in POW.TO as being an early stage pre-IPO investor in WS ([reference](https://betakit.com/wealthsimple-registers-three-businesses-indicating-expansion-into-new-financial-services/?fbclid=IwAR3iJ66E2AwjSRrTV8FtSiuKd7ro5mBybVU6Z7V7C7RvvsPYe6Sa3_5NFlY)).\n\n&gt;The goal is to get Wealthsimple to the size and scale to go public, something that Katchen said he\u2019s \u201cobsessed with.\u201d While admitting that an IPO was still a few years down the road, Katchen already has a target of $20 billion in assets under administration (AUA) as the tipping point (the company recently announced $4.3 billion in AUA as of Q1 2019) ([reference](https://betakit.com/wealthsimple-raises-100-million-from-allianz-x-to-build-a-full-stack-financial-service/))\n\n# Future Potential\n\nUltimately, my sense is that a spun-out Wealthsimple IPO eventually be worth a lot, perhaps even more than POW.TO at some point. Obviously the company is losing money right now, and no where even close to an IPO, and there are still many chances that this company could flop. The best analogy that I can think of is when Yahoo bought an early stake in Alibaba (BABA) back in the early 2000s, and there came a point where their stake in BABA was worth more than Yahoo\u2019s core business. I think an investment in POW.TO now is an early investment in WS before it goes public. ([reference](https://www.businessinsider.com/marissa-mayer-blames-activist-investors-selling-yahoo-alibaba-stake-2018-4))\n\n# Risks\n\n* Expansion problems. In the UK, they reported significant losses and despite increasing users. ([reference](https://www.ftadviser.com/your-industry/2019/10/07/robo-adviser-sees-losses-deepen/)). The US is also an especially competitive space with lots of similar competitors.\n* The robo-advising, fintech space is highly competitive now, and the Big Five Banks and other investment/trading companies could easily start offering low-cost or commission free trading\n* Competitors such as Robinhood could also expand into the Canadian market and take out a huge chunk of WS's userbase\n\n# The X Factor\n\nWhat I find particularly compelling about WS is they have aggressively positioned themselves to be a disruptor in the Canadian financial services industry. This is an area that has traditionally been thought to be a firewall for the Big Five Banks. There is also a generational gap in investing approaches, knowledge, and strategy, and I think WS has positioned itself nicely with first-time investors. My sense is that COVID-19 has also captured a huge amount of young adults with its trading app in the last few months, who will continue to use Wealthsimple products in the future. The average age of its user is around 34. As younger individuals are more comfortable with moving away traditional banking products, I think Wealthsimple\u2019s product offering offers significant advantages over its competitors.\n\n# Power Corp is a Good Home\n\nCurrently POW.TO is trading at $26.30, down from its 52-week high of $35.15. I see an investment in POW.TO now as fairly low risk, and while WS grows, and there is also the added benefit of a high dividend stock. One of the most confusing things I found about Power Corp was its confusing corporate structure where there were two stocks, Power Financial Corp, and Power Corp of Canada. Fortunately, in Dec 2019, they [simplified and consolidated the stocks](https://www.powercorporation.com/en/news/press-releases/2019/power-corporation-and-power-financial-announce-reorganization-simplified-corporate-structure-and-refocused-strategy-122591/), which also simplifies the holding structure of WS. I currently see [POW.TO](https://POW.TO) has a good stock to hold as well if you're a dividend holder, with a dividend of 6.86%.\n\nAlso, POW.TO is patient enough to bide its time and let its investment in WS grow, unlike a VC that might want to sell it quick. For example, the reason why WS went with POW.TO instead of the traditional VC route is explained here:\n\n\\&gt; Katchen has directly addressed the question of why he did not go the traditional VC route recently, saying: \\*If you are a business that requires perhaps decades to achieve the vision you have, well, if you\u2019re not going to be able to generate the kind of returns that venture needs is they will force you to sell yourself, they will force you to go public before you\u2019re ready, or they will just forget about you because you\u2019re going to be a write off\\*. And so Katchen essentially flipped Wealthsimple to Power Financial. Power is well known as a conservative, patient, long-term investor. ([https://opmwars.substack.com/p/the-wealthsimple-founders-before](https://opmwars.substack.com/p/the-wealthsimple-founders-before))\n\nMy belief is there is a huge unrecognized potential in POW.TO's massive ownership stake in WS that will be realized maybe 5-10 years down the road. I didn't really dive into the financials of POW.TO in relation, because the earnings reports do no actually say much about WS, so I'd be curious to see what people think.\n\n# Other Readings\n\n\\- [https://betakit.com/wealthsimple-raises-100-million-from-allianz-x-to-build-a-full-stack-financial-service/](https://betakit.com/wealthsimple-raises-100-million-from-allianz-x-to-build-a-full-stack-financial-service/)\n\n\\- [https://betakit.com/power-financial-claims-89-percent-stake-in-wealthsimple-following-new-30-million-investment/](https://betakit.com/power-financial-claims-89-percent-stake-in-wealthsimple-following-new-30-million-investment/)\n\n\\- [https://www.powercorporation.com/media/uploads/reports/quarter/pcc-2020-q2-eng\\_3KVPXLd.pdf](https://www.powercorporation.com/media/uploads/reports/quarter/pcc-2020-q2-eng_3KVPXLd.pdf)",

        "selftext": "**TLDR at the bottom**\n\nAs the title states, it is my opinion that SOAC warrants (SOAC.WT) are a great target for investors trying to get into the ESG sector. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD and make your own decisions.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. It is a $300 million blank check company with a dedicated ESG focus. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. As their [website](https://www.greenspac.com/) states, SOAC is \"focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices.\"\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nI believe that ESG has a strong impact on the market today. Just think bout some of the examples below and how it can affect the public's perception of a company and also how it can affect a company's stock.\n\n**E** for Environmental: climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, energy efficiency\n\n**S** for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards\n\n**G** for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards\n\nSOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nWhether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:\n\n[https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history](https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nWhat type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as \"manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others.\" They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThink about some of the \"hot\" investments sectors right now. I'm talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC's target comes from.\n\nMany people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.\n\nBased on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company's chance of success based on the public's excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its \"hype\" or its \"meme/moon potential\"). I can see that happening with SOAC.\n\nSpeaking of the management team...\n\n**Objective:**\n\nCEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard\n\nCFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT\n\nChairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nGood mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.\n\nBased on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088](https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088)\n\n[https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut](https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nSOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &gt; $1.50 and don't even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThe timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.\n\nWhat that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nSOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.\n\n**TLDR:** SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT's current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged by Washington stimulus talks and China tensions  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/markets-could-be-challenged-by-washington-stimulus-talks-and-china-tensions.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The debate in Washington over the next round of fiscal stimulus and rising tensions between the White House and China could act as brakes on the stock market in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week but were more sluggish Friday, as investors watched stimulus talks between Democrats and the Trump administration stall out. Investors also were concerned that President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning U.S. transactions with Tencent\u2019s We Chat and Bytedance\u2019s Tik Tok would accelerate the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China and draw retribution.\n*****\n&gt; Just ahead of Friday\u2019s market close, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just that he is recommending the White House move forward with executive orders on unemployment, student loans and rental foreclosures. He said a compromise could not be reached with Democrats, who wanted a $2 trillion package. Stocks edged higher after the announcement though details of the orders and how any assistance could be funded were unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to bring the Democrats back to the table to negotiate a deal by threatening to use an executive order. They may be able to get some things down, but it won\u2019t be enough to create the bridge they need while the economy continues to repair itself,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.4% for the week, ending at 3,351, after a 2 point gain Friday. The Nasdaq was down 0.9% Friday, ending at 11,010. It was up 2.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of the reason stocks have held in there well and continue to melt up is that one of the things that is priced in is a fifth fiscal policy package of $1.5 trillion. if we don\u2019t get one, I do think the market will retrace lower to reflect a lack of stimulus,\u201d said Arone. \u201cThe recovery will stall out without one.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for China, it has so far not taken actions against U.S. companies, even with the Trump administration\u2019s moves to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from using U.S. parts. The latest steps, however, raised concerns that China could find ways to retaliate, and that the U.S. will bar Chinese IPOs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn balance, continued hostility toward China is going to be a continued net negative for U.S. companies that are revenue exposed to China,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cWe know the exposure is very centered in the Nasdaq names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the stock market is entering a seasonally weak time, and while market psychology is still strong it could start to change. \u201cThe seasonals are starting to shift negatively. We all know September is a poor month and the degree of the escalation of the tensions between the U.S. in China is not a surprise, but the degree of the escalation over the last 48 hours is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not changing psychology, but it\u2019s challenging bullish psychology.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, there are some final earnings of the season, including technology company Cisco and food company Sysco. Some travel companies including Royal Caribbean report, as does consumer goods company Tapestry. In the week after, big retailers roll out their reports in the final earnings burst of the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Economic reports could be important in the coming week, as investors watch consumer price index inflation data Wednesday and retail sales Friday. Retail sales should provide a window into the consumer, as workers returned to their jobs but also faced uncertainty because of reclosings.\n*****\n&gt; CPI is important as the market has been assuming inflation will ultimately start to show gains because of the weakening dollar and ballooning budget deficits. CPI last month showed a 0.6% increase month over month.\n*****\n&gt; The pro-inflation trade has become important and has driven investors into stocks, gold, and out of the dollar.\n*****\n&gt; # Watch this trade\nThe dollar could be the key to the fate of markets in the coming week. The U.S. currency was edging higher Friday but is still down about 3.5% over the past four weeks. Gold declined Friday, and Treasury yields moved lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe dollar ... to me it just continues to be an important barometer that has a unique intersection of rates, inflation and risk assets,\u201d said Arone. \u201cWith rising China, U.S. tensions and combined with the fact that there\u2019s uncertainty about the fiscal policy package and the fact the dollar has declined so quickly, many are expecting it to catch a bid here and rebound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Part of the move in the dollar was based on the idea that huge government spending would increase the government\u2019s deficit and Treasury issuance. Emanuel said the news on stimulus could have a big impact on the trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe would make the argument the baseline expectation was a trillion dollars worth of stimulus to be implemented sometime in the month of August. Anything below that expectation is likely to cause the dollar to strengthen,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIt\u2019s a momentum and positioning trade as well as what has been ... the unwind of an asset diversification trade.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The stalling of talks could shift the market\u2019s view that the U.S. is willing to spend any amount to fight the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s changing the market psychology that the government\u2019s propensity to spend infinitely is not as great as it was earlier in the week,,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe dollar rallying, from our perspective, is a direct threat to a lot of these momentum trades.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said a strengthening dollar could be a headwind for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGiven the friction with China, to the extent the inflation numbers come in weaker than expected, the argument being that whole weaker dollar asset diversification has helped feed into increasing inflation expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIf the inflation data does surprise to the downside, given the rally in inflation ...it\u2019s further potential for the unwinding of the short dollar trade and the unwinding of the long gold trade which in our view bleeds over into stocks.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Hd63ibb.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/JB5lwYJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/QGdJU9H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMC2Lp9B/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohAnmHN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gbbisXK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IRn34qI.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1lbSlRY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND!)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C1gBrzCq/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/TYFPHKf3/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/KvRzNPXW/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/ryhsxhHW/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Individual Investors Still Don't Believe\n\n&gt; As mentioned in a prior post, in the past week the S&amp;P 500 has moved within 2% of its 2/19 high, but at the same time, less than a quarter of AAII respondents are optimistic for the future of stocks over the next six months. That begs the question- if there have been past times that sentiment and price action have been so detached from one another. Since the start of the AAII survey in 1987, there have been 10 periods (including the current one) in which the S&amp;P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high but bullish sentiment was less than 25% without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent prior occurrence was not even a full year ago. Back in October, sentiment was only slightly higher as the S&amp;P 500 was 1.84% from its all-time high. Prior to that, there were some scattered instances throughout 2013, 2015, and 2016 but before that, you would have to go back to 1993 to find another similar period. The one occurrence in 2013 stands out as it was both the lowest sentiment reading of these prior occurrences and the only one that occurred with the S&amp;P 500 right at an all-time high.\n\n&gt; As for where things stand after such instances, sentiment has tended to reverse higher in the following six months as the S&amp;P 500 has tended to move higher. The S&amp;P 500 has actually tended towards better than average returns over the next three months, although performance six months out has been modestly worse than average, even as it has been higher more often than not. Additionally, as shown in the second chart below, of the more recent occurrences of the past decade, they haven't marked any major top or bottom for the S&amp;P 500 with occurrences clustered both coming off of lows and in the middle of longer-term uptrends.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500-within-2-table.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Silver Takes the Gold\n\n&gt; Gold and silver prices were already on a tear heading into this week, but they've only seen their gains accelerate even more. With more than a day and a half of trading left in the week, front-month gold futures have rallied, but silver has been the real show stopper with a gain of 16%!\n\n&gt; Taking a look at a one-year chart of silver over the last year, things have really gone parabolic this week as the front-month futures contract is trading more than 40% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and 62% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Silver.png))**\n\n&gt; Were it not for the move in silver, gold's move would be getting all the attention. Prices for gold have also seen a major surge in the last month, rising from under $1,800 to the current level of $2,060 per ounce. While not as extended as silver, gold currently trades 14% above its 50-DMA and 26% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold.png))**\n\n&gt; With gold 25.7% above its 200-DMA and silver 62.2% above, the average spread of the two commodities currently stands at 44.3%. In the 40+ year history of the two futures contracts, there have only been a handful of prior periods where the average spread of the two commodities was larger or even above 35% for that matter with the most recent occurring back in early 2011. This recent rally in the two commodities has certainly been one for the ages.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold-Silver-Combined35.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Moves Off 52-Week Lows\n\n&gt; Within the US equity market, we've seen some major moves in individual stocks off their 52-week lows over the last few months. Look at the table below. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, stocks in the index are up an average of 87.6% from their respective 52-week lows. Looking at performance by individual sectors, stocks in the Energy sector are up an average of 136.8%, while the average Consumer Discretionary stock has rallied 131.4%. The Technology sector wasn't hit nearly as hard by the Covid-crash as other sectors, but stocks in the sector have doubled on an average basis relative to their 52-week lows. The only sector where stocks are up less than 50% on an average basis from their 52-week lows is Utilities at 46.33%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low.png))**\n\n&gt; For many investors, the holy grail of stock picking is the proverbial ten-bagger. A ten-bagger is a stock that multiplies by ten times its original price. Usually, this happens over the span of years, but in the Covid-economy, we've actually seen a number of these ten-baggers play out in the span of months. While most of these examples are in the small-cap space, shares of Wayfair (W), which has a current market cap of $27.5 billion, have rallied from $21.70 on March 19th to its current price of $290.85 now. That's a gain of more than 1,200% in less than five months!\n\n&gt; Within the entire Russell 1,000, 257 stocks have at least doubled off their 52-week lows, and in the table below we highlight the 34 stocks that are at least a quarter of the way to the ten-bagger club and have rallied more than 250%. As mentioned above, W tops the list, but Fastly (FSLY), which has barely been public for a year, is just shy of the club with a gain of 992%. Behind FSLY, Livongo Health (LVGO) is up 855%. Given that LVGO just got a takeover offer from Teladoc (TDOC), the 11th best-performing stock on the list, it may only make the ten-bagger club under the banner of the TDOC ticker.\n\n&gt; In looking through the list of stocks shown, many of these names come from the Health Care, Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors and have been direct beneficiaries of the new Covid-economy. At the same time, six stocks from the Energy sector made the list as well as they recovered from their bombed-out levels after oil prices briefly traded in negative territory earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low-table-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Labor Market Continues Summer Momentum\n\n&gt; After falling the most on record in April, the US labor market has rebounded with three consecutive months of job gains, adding back more than 9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. In July, the economy added back nearly 1.8 million jobs, ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimates for 1.5 million and lowering the unemployment rate from 11.1% to 10.2%, but lingering measurement issues could add 1% to that number, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, job gains were broad based across industries, with a third of the increase coming from the leisure and hospitality sector\u2014the \u201cscene of the accident\u201d industries\u2014while only information, and mining and logging posted declines in July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMarch and April were historically brutal months for the labor market, but the labor market\u2019s resiliency this summer has been a welcome development,\u201d stated LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, the next few months will be critical for the economy as schools reopen and additional fiscal stimulus still hangs in the balance.\u201d\n\n&gt; The July report also comes on the heels of a rise in COVID-19 cases across the Sunbelt region of the United States. Because of the date of the survey, it may not fully reflect the economic impact of some of the more recent high-frequency data that has captured some of the effect of rising cases. Still, the jobs report shows that the US economy is continuing to heal despite the long road ahead.\n\n&gt; # Are Recessions Good For Stocks?\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t like any recession we\u2019ve ever seen, as it was sparked by a horrible pandemic and happened because people were told to stay inside. The impact was the worst contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter that anyone who is reading this has ever seen. But what is quite surprising is the fact the Nasdaq has made 30 all-time highs so far in 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained four consecutive months, all while the unemployment rate remains above 10%.\n\n&gt; Why is this happening? There are two main schools of thought. One is that stocks are forecasting a better economy later this year and into 2021; remember, stocks tend to lead the economy and could be doing so once again. Another school of thought is that the massive fiscal and monetary policy are boosting equity prices, while not helping the overall economy quite as much.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch. It actually isn\u2019t abnormal to see stocks gain during a recession. \u201cThis is one that might surprise many people, but stocks have actually gained during 7 of the past 12 recessions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the difference between what is happening on Wall Street compared with Main Street is about as wide as we\u2019ve ever seen, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t be as big of a surprise that stocks have been strong.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 actually gained 1.3% on average when looking at the 12 previous recessions going back to World War II, with a very impressive median advance of 5.7% (the average is skewed lower due to 2008). We continue to expect this recession to end soon, if it isn\u2019t over already. In fact, when the end of the recession is officially declared at a later date, we could have yet another recession that saw stock market gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.5.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-RbeH2LFU4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 10TH, 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/NHhXB13.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/H67Mg1J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](hhttps://i.imgur.com/5DIQO1B.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RgQdixH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdVRiJu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tuCqkCk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RqbAmnt.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pZjdCyt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ni20iSQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DgPcij6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LcirLAw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND\n&gt; **T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND** T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

Today, I went deep on call options which are at a nearly 400% discount from Friday at less than 50 per call, was over 1.88 friday, high was 2.45. \n\nAfter watching action all day, im positive it has support just over the 23 line and wont drop further. Now is the time to jump on this as im sure by monday this is going back up a few bucks. Could potentially be a quick double up, or it wont and i may lose 30% of what i put in, but the upside is too good not to mention. I realize this option is not a penny stock but if you go up one more level it is. \n\nHas some amazing call options these last few weeks. Hit it big on visa 2 week ago, last week we won on delta turning a .14 contract into .45. Best yet was shll for Aug 21st, paid .15 per for 3, sold 2 at .75 and the 3rd at 1.05. \n\nThis is a repeat",

        "selftext": "Note: I wrote this article on August 15, 2010, when the post-market close price of VIRT was around $25/share. \n\n**I. Introduction**\n\nHey guys. This is going to be a long read, so for those who don\u2019t want to read the full thing, I have a tl;dr below. This initially began as a fun research exercise, but after looking into this stock I became convinced that this stock has some big potential gains. I bought the stock today at around $24.20 along with some long term call options \u2013 since I\u2019ve bought my shares now, I figured I could post this and share the love and tendies with my favorite autists in WSB. If the response is good, I\u2019ll think about doing this more in the future.\n\nAs a short background, I\u2019m an ex-big law lawyer who recently quit to invest full-time. While I specialized in M&amp;A and restructuring, I\u2019ve always been interested in investing and am now dabbling in analyzing stocks. I\u2019m still very much an amateur, but I leave it up to you as to whether the DD below is good enough.\n\nI\u2019m recommending buying shares or long-term calls in Virtu Virtu Financial, Inc.

You buy a share that\u2019s ATH and the next day it drops, and you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019ve made the right choice. You\u2019re wondering, why hold a stock for a potential 10% gain when it might drop 50% in the next few months?

So yes, it\u2019s a scary time to invest. The FAANG stocks and Microsoft are now hitting ATHs and record multiples, and everyone is saying everything is overpriced. Even gold isn\u2019t safe \u2013 when Russia announced that they had a \u201cworking vaccine\u201d (which was false), gold prices dropped 5% and the VIX briefly popped up 10 percentage points. On top of all of this, stocks making ATH records seems weird to me \u2013 in the U.S. if you go outside, you can quite literally see the depressed economy with your own eyes. I live in Manhattan, and when I go outside, I see a good number of shops that are either temporarily or permanently shuttered. \n\nNow, on the flip-side, there is a good argument saying that the high valuation multiples are justified, due to the historically low interest rates and a re-rating of certain technology stocks given that these companies have demonstrated how they can be a safe investment even in a recessionary type environment. But you know it, I know it, no one knows if this new normal of valuations will hold true for the next few months or years. \n\nBut who the hell wants to hold cash? Savings accounts basically yield 0%, amounting to blatant robbery, and everyone is expecting inflation to occur, so we\u2019re at a dilemma \u2013 invest, and asset values might crash, but don\u2019t invest, and you\u2019ll find your money value being chipped away by inflation. \n\n**III. So Buy Virtu Financial, Inc.**\n\nIn this environment, I strongly believe that Virtu is a perfect investment. Either the stock market will tank or go up, but I don\u2019t see how you can lose with Virtu either way. I\u2019ll explain more below \u2013 but if the stock market tanks (and volatility goes up), Virtu will do great, and if the stock market doesn\u2019t tank, Virtu still stands to benefit (i) because retail trade volumes and volatility will likely stay elevated compared to historical averages; and (ii) because Virtu looks already cheap at current levels, which ensures that at the very worst the stock will only stall at current valuations. \n\n**So, What does the Company do?** Virtu Financial is a company that provides market making and also execution services. It\u2019s the largest high-frequency market maker globally, with a big presence in the U.S. equity market. The main source of its revenue comes from market making.\n\n**How does it make money?** Virtu has multiple sources of revenue, but the main source of its revenue comes from market making. As a market maker, Virtu makes money by providing liquidity in the stock market. That is, for example \u2013 if you want to sell a share of Amazon, you put a market order in Robinhood, right? Robinhood sells this order to Virtu at dirt-cheap prices, and Virtu in turn buys the share of Amazon from you. By taking both buy-side and sell-side positions, rapidly and in large volumes, Virtu profits off of the bid-ask spread. The profit is virtually risk-free money, and Virtu has been a cash printing money since its inception. Virtu is notably famous for NEVER losing money from 2009 to 2014, except for ONE SINGLE DAY. They\u2019ve had positive free cash flow since they went public in 2015. So yes, this is a great business. On the flip side, you have to ask \u2013 if this is such a great business, why did it drop from $35/share in 2018 to $16 in early 2020 (prior the coronavirus shock)? I\u2019ll address this below, after going over why I think Virtu is incredibly undervalued as of now.\n\n**III. Virtu Financial, Inc. looks incredibly cheap at this price**\n\nAs of In Q1 of 2020, Virtu announced an adjusted EPS of $2.05, a WHOPPING +659% JUMP in earnings in relation to the previous quarter. In Q1 alone, the company earned 80% of last year\u2019s revenue. What drove such a huge increase in revenue and earnings? It was mainly two things: (i) an increase in trading volume; and (ii) an increase in volatility. With volatility levels that matched the 2008 financial crisis, and with new Robinhood investors jumping into the stock market in unprecedented levels, Virtu was back to printing cash. A ton of cash. \n\nIn Q2, while earnings dropped in comparison to Q1, revenues were still incredibly high compared to historical averages. In Q2, Virtu locked in an adjusted EPS of $1.73, totaling $3.78 EPS for the first half of FY 2020. Using these numbers, and a price of $24.80 (post-close market price as of August 14, 2020) the P/E valuation of Virtu for 1H FY 2020 is 3.3X, which is insanely, insanely low, for any company that is in existence. Analysts are predicting that Virtu will have lower numbers of EPS of $0.87 in Q3 and $0.73 in Q4, but this still gives us an FY 2020 P/E value of 4.5X which is still historically low. \n\nNow, mind you \u2013 obviously, insanely good times like this of course won\u2019t continue. And this is why you haven\u2019t seen Virtu reach its ATHs again. The market clearly isn\u2019t convinced yet as to how long this money making parade will continue. Analysts predict that for FY 2021 and 2022, Virtu will see a more conservative annual EPS of 2.12-2.17. I don\u2019t believe that these numbers are at all going to be accurate (no analyst can accurately predict volatility in the next two years), but even if we allow these assumptions to hold, the forward P/E valuation will be around 11X for the next two years. Virtu has historically traded anywhere b/w 12-24 P/E valuations since its IPO. So P/E valuations are at historical lows. \n\nIn Q1 and Q2, Virtu has been printing so much cash that they\u2019ve decided to prepaid a loan of $100 million dollars that was due in march 2026 (now, to be fair, there\u2019s still a good amount of loans outstanding due to a financing of a merger that occurred in 2019). Given all of these factors, I won\u2019t profess that I know what the fair price of Virtu is, but at the very least, Virtu SHOULD NOT be trading at \\~11X forward earnings or at \\~4.5X current earnings. At the very least, Virtu should be reverting to historical averages (12-15X earnings, or 2.5-3.0X sales). I believe there is a very good chance this stock will see 30-50% returns in the near term.\n\n**IV. But why the hell did Virtu Financial Go down to $15 in the past?**\n\nLook, obviously, the price of Virtu Financial is somewhat a function of volatility. Revenues of Q1 were primarily derived from the Market Making segment (\\~83% of Net Trading Income) which is largely a function of volatility and trading volume. Back when Virtu peaked at \\~$35 in April of 2018, the VIX was at a relative all time high at around \\~30 (much lower than what we saw in march, but slightly higher than what we are seeing recently). And because volatility matters so much to this firm, when expectations of volatility drop, the stock price will go down as well. A decline from $23-25/share to the lows of $15/share occurred in 2019-2020 as we saw very low levels of volatility. In addition, Virtu in 2019 doubled its debt by 1 billion, in order to finance a merger transaction with an agency broker Company called ITG. The low volatility levels and the increased debt burden was enough the pressure the stock to all time lows. \n\n**V. Why I think Virtu will go up/stay up.**\n\nI strongly, strongly believe that we won\u2019t ever see Virtu going back down the teens for a long, long time. Given the current valuations, Virtu will stay at this level, or go up \u2013 by a lot. Here are the reasons, laid down one by one.\n\n**A. Like I said, the shares are currently very cheap**: cheap valuation creates enough downside protection. \n\n**B.** **We won\u2019t see 2019 levels of volatility for a long time:** the stock hit historically low levels as we continuously experienced low levels of volatility until the coronavirus hit the United States. We likely won\u2019t be going down to these levels for a long, long time. During the 2008 great recession, the VIX spiked to similar numbers as we are seeing now, and these levels, while trending downward, maintained their relatively elevated levels for years. Unlike 2008, however, the current stock market has bounced and roared back to historical ATHs in a matter of months, while it took 4-5 years in 2008. Valuations are at historical highs, and the fed is printing money like never before, but we also have a very real recession in our hands, and the political election is coming up. With Biden likely to win as a candidate, the markets will have to adjust their expectations for company earnings pretty soon. Given this backdrop, if I had to bet, we are going to see elevated levels of volatility for a longer time than expected. And this is why I believe analysts will soon be re-upping their EPS estimates for 2021 and 2022. Note that analysts were already off by 50% and 11% in their Q1 and Q2 estimates, and Virtu has generally beaten analyst expectations most of the time.\n\n**C. Trading volumes are trending up:** trading volumes is the second lever that elevates Virtu\u2019s earnings. While trading volume obviously is somewhat a function of volatility, a decrease in volatility won\u2019t necessarily mean trading volumes will go back down to historical levels. I believe we\u2019re witnessing a structural shift, particularly in retail investing, with the advent of Robinhood and $0 commission trading. See this article ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-blows-past-rivals-record-150000339.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-blows-past-rivals-record-150000339.html)). The article notes that, on August 10, 2020, Robinhood revealed data showing that **average daily revenue trades were $4.31 million in June**, which was higher than ALL of its publicly traded rivals (E Trade, Charles Schwab, etc.). Robinhood manages much less money than Charles Schwab, but the retail trading volume in Robinhood dwared that of Charles Schwab. This huge increase in retail investing has been a huge boon for high frequency traders. And I believe \u2013 and more importantly, the CEO of Virtu Financial believes that this retail trading boom is here to stay. At Virtu\u2019s most recent earnings call, the CEO has said \u201cwe did see an explosion of retail activity that has continued as a percentage of overall market \u2026 I think that is a secular change not a cyclical change. In other marketplaces as well, you see retail trading of futures and things along those lines. And so it wouldn't surprise me if we started to see some runway.\u201d This is not something I believe the professionals are fully appreciating. \n\n**D. The Company is successfully delevering its balance sheet:** I talked about how the share price drop in 2019 to all time lows was likely a function of volatility and debt. As I said, volatility levels are likely here to stay. Furthermore, the company is now starting to delever its balance sheet. As noted earlier, the company earned so much cash it decide to prepay $100 million in loans. A continued delivering of the balance sheet will justify awarding the company with higher multiples in valuation.\n\n**E. Finally -- the CEO is buying shares:** I love being on the side of insider trades. Who doesn\u2019t? On August 12, 2020, the CEO of Virtu bought $2.2 million worth of shares @ $22.45 in the open market. The last time the CEO bought shares like this was in September-November of 2019, when he bought \\~$500,00 worth of shares @ \\~17.00. Even at elevated prices, the CEO had enough conviction to buy 4 times the value he had previously invested. If you don\u2019t believe me that Virtu is undervalued, believe the CEO. Prices are up around \\~10% since the CEO purchased shares, but I think the shares are still very much underpriced. \n\n**VI. Risk Factors**\n\nI\u2019m not going to go in too deep in this section, but note that there are of course risks to this investment. Other than volatility going down quicker than expected, other risk factors are as follows: first, the company is structured so that the founder (Vincent Viola) of the Company wields absolute control of the company. I understand that the structure is a bit wonky. I view this as a positive as I don\u2019t mind having an owner of the company owning a majority of the shares. Second, there is of course regulatory risk. Virtu pays for order flow from brokerage firms and profits off of the spreads. There was a rigorous debate a while back as to whether Virtu\u2019s business model is morally wrong after the book \u201cFlash Boys\u201d was released. There was some talk of regulation, but this has yet to happen, and I don\u2019t think it will happen anytime soon. \n\nAs a disclosure, I\u2019m obviously long VIRT. I bought a significant amount of shares and options today. I wrote this myself and it expresses my own opinion. I\u2019m not receiving compensation for this and have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Don\u2019t blame me if the stock goes down. Do your own due diligence. \n\nTL; DR **I strongly believe these shares are undervalued. I\u2019ve allocated 50% of my portfolio into this stock today. Volatility will stay up, trading volumes will stay up, the CEO bought the stock a few days ago, debt levels are going down and based on current financials, the valuation is pretty damn cheap. Buy leaps if you prefer options. I believe there\u2019s 30-50% upside in the coming next few months.**",

Autodesk offers similar products but from all the reviews I've read online solidworks and catia are better for engineering compared to autodesks autocad and inventor platfroms. DASTY seems to be more diversified though and acquired  Medidata Solutions in the past year which is an American technology company that develops and markets software as a service (SaaS) for clinical trials. These include protocol development, clinical site collaboration and management; randomization and trial supply management; capturing patient data through web forms, mobile health (mHealth) devices, laboratory reports, and imaging systems; quality monitor management; safety event capture; and monitoring and business analytics. \n\nI can't find much discussion on the topic as Dassault Systemes doesn't seem to be a very popular stock in the US.

        "selftext": " **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**\n\nStocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. \n\nThe three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities\u2019 third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&amp;P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.\n\nIt seems traders are expecting September\u2019s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.\n\nFor the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.\n\nThe labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks\u2019 report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September\u2019s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we\u2019ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The index ticked down to 55.4 in September from 56.0 in August, whereas consensus economists expected a rise to 56.5. \n* The Senate Commerce Committee voted to authorize subpoenas forcing testimony from Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (GOOG) setting up what could be a contentious hearing with the largest U.S. social-media companies in the midst of a national election.\n* As big U.S. commercial banks close their books on the third quarter, analysts expect them to report a 30% to 60% plunge in profits on the year-ago period due to the pandemic-induced recession and near-record low-interest rates.\n* The Mark Zuckerberg-led company said in a statement that the advertising restrictions would be in place between Oct. 27 and Nov. 3. The latest policy change targets any ads that question voting methodology, delegitimize any lawful method of voting or voting tabulation, or make claims of widespread voter fraud, as per Facebook\u2019s statement.\n* New Ford[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24F&amp;src=cashtag_click)(F) CEO Jim Farley starts today.

        "selftext": "Spent some time looking up the best performing stocks (1 year and one month returns) from ICLN, PBW, and TAN because I'd rather not invest in the entire ETF when a lot of their lesser performing stocks are weighing down the returns. \n\nThere is obvious strong momentum in clean energy, and the criteria for my list is top ten one year performance in the ETF as well as strong one month performance. \n\nIf a stock failed to have a strong one month return I didn't include it on the list (not showing strong momentum).  I currently own a lot of shares in ICLN and I plan on moving money into some of the following stocks:\n\n\nNIO   1 Yr - 1268%   1 Mo -  9%\nVSLR  1 Yr - 567%   1 Mo - 41 %\nPLUG  1 Yr - 480%   1 Mo - 7%\nRUN   1 Yr - 415%    1 Mo - 40%\nBLNK 1 Yr - 330%    1 Mo - 46%\nLAC    1 Yr - 315%    1 Mo - 59%\nENPH 1 Yr - 308%    1 Mo - 16%\nREGI   1 Yr - 275%    1 Mo - 40%\nDQ      1 Yr - 240%    1 Mo - 33%\nSEDG  1 Yr - 215%    1 Mo - 13%\nJKS     1 Yr - 188%    1 Mo - 86%\nVWS    1 Yr - 111%   1 Mo - 6 %\nSPWR 1 Yr - 108%    1 Mo - 11 %\nCSIQ   1 Yr - 105%    1 Mo - 8%\n\nThere are some lesser known names on here that might be worth looking at.
